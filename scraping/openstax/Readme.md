## Openstax Data Instructor readme
These are mostly in chapter by chapter docx files.
In all chapters there are end of chapter questions, but they start with different headings sometimes.

The testbanks I think we can use as is.

## Todo

- [ ] Process Docx and Filter Questions
- [ ] Process Test Banks

Remember to be nice! Don't post Instructors manual question answer pairs in dataset online.
Only use questions.
	**The instructor solutions manual contains the instructor-facing answers to the problems and exercises within the textbook. Since many instructors use these questions in graded assignments, we ask that you not post these questions and the answers on any publicly available websites.**
