      "Question: Look at the pot of soup and the tub ofwaterin theFigurebelow. Which do you think has greater thermal energy?\n",
      "Answer: The soup isboilinghot and has a temperature of 100 °C, whereas thewaterin the tub is just comfortably warm, with a temperature of about 38 °C. Although the water in the tub has a much lower temperature, it has greater thermal energy.The particles of soup have greater average kinetic energy than the particles of water in the tub, explaining why the soup has a higher temperature. However, the mass of the water in the tub is much greater than the mass of the soup in the pot. This means that there are many more particles of water than soup. All those moving particles give the water in the tub greater total kinetic energy, even though their average kinetic energy is less. Therefore, the water in the tub has greater thermal energy than the soup.

      "Answer: Fossil fuels contain stored chemical energy that came originally from the sun.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IEZvc3NpbCBGdWVscyBGb3JtZWQ.\">\n",
      "      How Fossil Fuels FormedWhen ancient plants underwent photosynthesis, they changed energy in sunlight to stored chemical energy in food. The plants used the food and so did the organisms that ate the plants. After the plants and other organisms died, their remains gradually changed to fossil fuels as they were covered and compressed by layers of sediments. Petroleum and natural gas formed from ocean organisms and are found together. Coal formed from giant tree ferns and other swamp plants.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Rm9zc2lsIEZ1ZWxzIGFuZCB0aGUgRW52aXJvbm1lbnQ.\">\n",
      "      Fossil Fuels and the EnvironmentWhen fossil fuels burn, they release thermal energy, water vapor, and carbon dioxide. The thermal energy can be used to generate electricity or do other work. The carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere and is a major cause of global climate change. The burning of fossil fuels also releases many pollutants into the air. Pollutants such as sulfur dioxide form acid rain, which kills living things and damages metals, stonework, and other materials. Pollutants such as nitrogen oxides cause smog, which is harmful to human health. Tiny particles, or particulates, released when fossil fuels burn also harm human health.TheFigurebelowshows the amounts of pollutants released by different fossil fuels. Natural gas releases the least pollution; coal releases the most. Petroleum has the additional risk of oil spills, which may seriously damage ecosystems. To learn about other ways that our dependence on fossil fuels damages the environment and threatens human life, watch the video at this URL:http://coal.wiki.lovett.org/Home\n",
      "Question: Some newer models of cars and other motor vehicles can run on natural gas. Why would a natural gas vehicle be better for the environment than a vehicle that burns gasoline, which is made from oil?\n",
      "Answer: Natural gas produces much less pollution and carbon dioxide when it burns than gasoline does. So a natural gas vehicle would contribute less to global climate change, acid rain, and air pollution that harms health. Besides being better for the environment, burning natural gas instead of gasoline results in less engine wear and provides more energy for a given amount of fuel.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TnVjbGVhciBFbmVyZ3k.\">\n",
      "      Nuclear EnergyLike fossil fuels, the radioactive element uranium can be used to generate electrical energy in power plants. This source of energy is known asnuclear energy. In a nuclear power plant, the nuclei of uranium atoms are split apart into smaller nuclei in the process of nuclear fission. This process releases a tremendous amount of energy from just a small amount of uranium. The total supply of uranium in the world is quite limited, however, and cannot be replaced once it is used up. That&#8217;s why nuclear energy is a nonrenewable resource. The use of nuclear energy also produces dangerous radioactive wastes. In addition, accidents at nuclear power plants have the potential to release large amounts of harmful radiation into the environment.\n",

      "Answer: Metal atoms readily give up valence electrons and become positive ions whenever they form bonds. When nonmetals bond together, the atoms share valence electrons and do not become ions. For example, when oxygen atoms bond together they form oxygen molecules in which two oxygen atoms share two pairs of valence electrons equally, so neitheratombecomes charged.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TWV0YWxsaWMgQm9uZHMgYW5kIHRoZSBQcm9wZXJ0aWVzIG9mIE1ldGFscw..\">\n",

      "      Displacement and Buoyant ForceObjects such as ships may float in a fluid like water because of buoyant force.

This is known asArchimedes’ law(or Archimedes’ principle). For an entertaining video presentation of Archimedes’ law, go to this URL:http://videos.howstuffworks.com/discovery/6540-mythbusters-lets-talk-buoyancy-video.htm<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RmxvYXRpbmcgT2JqZWN0cyBhbmQgQXJjaGltZWRlc-KAmSBMYXc.\">\n",
      "      Floating Objects and Archimedes’ LawArchimedes’ law explains why some objects float in fluids even though they are very heavy. It all depends on how much fluid they displace. The cruise ship pictured in the opening image is extremely heavy, yet it stays afloat. If a steel ball with the same weight as the ship were placed in water, it would sink to the bottom. This is modeled in theFigurebelow. The reason the ball sinks is that its shape is very compact, so it displaces relatively little water. The volume of water displaced by the steel ball weighs less than the ball itself, so the buoyant force is not as great as the force of gravity pulling down on the ball. Thus, the ball sinks.Now look at the ship’s hull in theFigureabove. Its shape causes the ship to displace much more water than the ball. In fact, the weight of the displaced water is greater than the weight of the ship. As a result, the buoyant force is greater than the force of gravity acting on the ship, so the ship floats.\n",

The levers increase the force and change its direction.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RWZmaWNpZW5jeSBvZiBDb21wb3VuZCBNYWNoaW5lcw..\">\n",
      "      Efficiency of Compound MachinesFrictionis a force that opposes motion between any surfaces that are touching. All machines have moving parts and friction, so they have to use some of the work that is applied to them to overcome friction. This makes all machines less than 100 percent efficient. Because compound machines have more moving parts than simple machines, they generally have more friction to overcome. As a result, compound machines tend to have lowerefficiencythan simple machines. When a compound machine consists of many simple machines, friction can become a serious problem, and it may produce a lot ofheat. Lubricants such as oil or grease may be used to coat the moving parts of a machine so they slide over each other more easily. This is how friction is reduced in a car engine.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TWVjaGFuaWNhbCBBZHZhbnRhZ2Ugb2YgQ29tcG91bmQgTWFjaGluZXM.\">\n",
      "      Mechanical Advantage of Compound MachinesThemechanical advantageof a machine is the factor by which it changes the force applied to the machine. Many machines increase the force applied to them, and this is how they make work easier. Compound machines tend to have a greater mechanical advantage than simple machines. That’s because the mechanical advantage of a compound machine equals the product of the mechanical advantages of all its component simple machines. The greater the number of simple machines it contains, the greater its mechanical advantage tends to be.\n",

      "Question: Making products with 3-D printers has several advantages over making them with machines in factories. What do you think some of the advantages might be?\n",
      "Answer: Making products with 3-D printers would allow anyone anywhere to make just about anything, provided they have the printer, powder, and computer program. Suppose, for example, that you live in a remotelocationand need a new part for your car. The solution? Just download the design on your computer and print the part on your 3-D printer. Manufacturing would no longer require specially designed machines in factories that produce pollution. Another advantage of using 3-D printers to make products is that no materials are wasted. This would lower manufacturing costs as well as save natural resources.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IFRlY2hub2xvZ3kgRXZvbHZlcw..\">\n",
      "      How Technology EvolvesNew technologies such as 3-D printers often evolve slowly as new materials, designs, or processes are invented. Solar-powered cars are a good example. For several decades, researchers have been working on developing practical solar-powered cars. Why? Cars powered by sunlight have at least two important advantages overgas-powered cars. Theenergythey use is free and available almost everywhere, and they produce no pollution. The timeline inTablebelowshows some of the milestones in the evolution of solar-powered cars.Evolution of Solar-Powered CarsMilestone1954: First modern solar cellThe first modern solar cell was invented in 1954 by a team of researchers at Bell Labs in the U.S. It could convert lightenergyto enough electricity to power devices.1955: First solar carIn 1955, William G. Cobb of General Motors demonstrated his 15-inch-long “Sunmobile,” the world's first solar-powered automobile. Its tinyelectric motorwas powered by 12 solarcellson top of the car.1983: First practical solar carIn 1983, the first drivable solar car was created by Hans Tholstrup, a Danish inventor who was influenced by the earlier Sunmobile. Called the “Quiet Achiever,” Tholstrup’s car was driven 4000 km across Australia. However, its averagespeedwas only 23 km/h, despite having more than 700 solarcellson its top panel.1987: First World Solar ChallengeInspired by his success with the Quiet Achiever, in 1987 Tholstrup launched the first World Solar Challenge. This was the world’s first solar car race. The race is now held every other year. In that first race, the winner was General Motors’ “Sunraycer,” shown here. It had an averagespeedof 67 km/h. Its aerodynamic shape helped it achieve that speed.2008: First Commercial solar carIn 2008, the first commercial solar car was introduced. Called the Venturi Astrolab, it has a top speed of 120 km/h. To go this fast while using very little energy, it is built of ultra-light materials. Its oversized body protects the driver in case of collision and provides a lot of surface area for solar cells.\n",
      "Question: Why was the invention of the solar cell important to the evolution of solar car technology?\n",
      "Answer: The solar car could not exist without the solar cell. This invention provided a way to convert light energy to electricity that could be used to run a device such as a car.\n",
      "Question: The 1955 “Sunmobile” was just a model car. It was too small for people to drive. Why was it an important achievement in the evolution of solar car technology?\n",
      "Answer: The car wasn’t practical, but it was a working solar car. It showed people that solar car technology is possible. It spurred others, including Hans Tholstrup, to work on solar cars that people could actually drive.\n",

Additional examples of physical properties include:odorboiling pointability to conductheatability to conduct electricityability to dissolve in other substancesSome of these properties are illustrated in theFiguresbelow,below,below, andbelow. The video at this URL below compares physical properties such as these for different classes of matter:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q7wy8ycpE48(5:41)The strong smell of swimming pool water is the odor of chlorine, which is added to the water to kill germs andalgae. In contrast, bottled spring water, which contains no chlorine, does not have an odor.Coolant is added to the water in a car radiator to keep the water fromboilingand evaporating. Coolant has a higher boiling point than water and adding it to the water increases the boiling point of the solution.This teakettle is made of aluminum except for its handle, which is made of plastic. Aluminum is a good conductor ofheat. It conducts heat from the flames on the range to the water inside the kettle, so the water heats quickly. Plastic, on the other hand, is not a good conductor of heat. It stays cool enough to touch even when the rest of the teakettle becomes very hot.Copper is a good conductor of electricity. That's why electric wires are often made of copper. They are covered with a protective coating of plastic, which does not conduct electricity.\n",
      "Question: The coolant that is added to a car radiator also has a lowerfreezingpoint than water. Why is this physical property useful?\n",
      "Answer: When coolant is added to water in a car radiator, it lowers thefreezingpoint of the water. This prevents the water in the radiator from freezing when thetemperaturedrops below 0°C, which is the freezing point of pure water.\n",

      "Answer: The discovery of particles smaller than atoms doesn’t mean that we should scrap the entire theory. Atoms are still known to be the smallest particles of elements that have the properties of the elements. Also, it is atoms—not particles of atoms—that combine in fixed proportions in compounds. Instead of throwing out Dalton’s theory, scientists have refined and expanded on it.There are many other important physical science theories.

The wordparsimonymeans “thriftiness.” The law of parsimony states that, when choosing between competing theories, you should select the theory that makes the fewest assumptions. In other words, the simpler theory is more likely to be correct. For example, you probably know that Earth and the other planets of our solar system orbit around thesun. But several centuries ago, it was believed that Earth is at the center of the solar system and the other planets orbit around Earth. While it is possible to explain the movement of planets according to this theory, the explanation is unnecessarily complex.\n",

A computer contains integratedcircuits, or microchips, that consist of millions of tiny electronic components. Information is encoded in digital electronic signals. Rapid pulses ofvoltageswitch electriccurrenton and off, producing long strings of 1’s (current on) and 0’s (current off). The 1’s and 0’s are the “letters” of the code, and a huge number of them are needed. One digit (either 0 or 1) is called a bit, which stands for “binary digit.” Each group of eight digits is called a byte, and a billion bytes is called a gigabyte. Because a computer’s circuits are so tiny and close together, the computer can be very fast and capable of many complex tasks while remaining small.The parts of a computer that transmit, process, or store digital signals are pictured and described in theFigurebelow. They include the CPU, hard drive, ROM, and RAM. The motherboard ties all these parts of the computer together.The CPU, or central processing unit, carries out program instructions. You can learn more about CPUs and how they work by watching the video at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c06WxAvD4Nk.The hard drive is a magnetic disc that provides long-term storage for programs and data.ROM (read-only memory) is a microchip that provides permanent storage. It stores important information such as start-up instructions. This memory remains even after the computer is turned off.RAM (random-access memory) is a microchip that temporarily stores programs and data that are currently being used.

      "      What Is Static Electricity?Static electricityis a buildup of electric charges on objects. Charges build up when negative electrons are transferred from one object to another. The object that gives up electrons becomes positively charged, and the object that accepts the electrons becomes negatively charged. This can happen in several ways.One way electric charges can build up is throughfrictionbetween materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. When you wipe your rubber-soled shoes on the wool mat, for example, electrons rub off the mat onto your shoes. As a result of this transfer of electrons, positive charges build up on the mat and negative charges build up on you.Once an object becomes electrically charged, it is likely to remain charged until it touches another object or at least comes very close to another object. That’s because electric charges cannot travel easily through air, especially if the air is dry.\n",

But what if someone else has made the measurement? How do you know which digits are known for certain and which are estimated? How can you tell how many significant figures there are in the measurement? There are several rules for counting significant figures:Leading zeros are never significant. For example, in the number 006.1, only the 6 and 1 are significant.Zeros within a number between nonzero digits are always significant. For example, in the number 106.1, the zero is significant, so this number has four significant figures.Zeros that show only where the decimal point falls are not significant. For example, the number 470,000 has just two significant figures (4 and 7). The zeros just show that the 4 represents hundreds of thousands and the 7 represents tens of thousands. Therefore, these zeros are not significant.Trailing zeros that aren't needed to show where the decimal point falls are significant. For example, 4.00 has three significant figures.\n",

      "Answer: The electromagnetic force of repulsion between positively charged protons is overcome by a stronger force, called the strong nuclear force.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-U3Ryb25nIE51Y2xlYXIgRm9yY2U.\">\n",
      "      Strong Nuclear ForceThe strong nuclear force is a force of attraction betweenfundamental particlescalledquarks, which have a type of charge called color charge. The strong nuclear force is transferred between quarks by fundamental force-carrying particles called gluons. Both protons and neutrons consist of quarks. The exchange of gluons holds quarks together within aprotonorneutron. Excess, or residual, strong force holds together protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The strong nuclear force is strong enough to overcome the electromagnetic force of repulsion pushing protons apart. Both forces are represented in theFigurebelow.The types ofquarksfound in protons and neutrons are called up quarks (u) and down quarks (d). Eachprotonconsists of two up quarks and one down quark (uud), and eachneutronconsists of one up quark and two down quarks (udd). This diagram represents two protons.The strong nuclear force works only over very short distances. As a result, it isn’t effective if the nucleus gets too big. As more protons are added to the nucleus, the electromagnetic force of repulsion between them gets stronger, while the strong nuclear force of attraction between them gets weaker. This puts an upper limit on the number of protons an atom can have and remain stable. If atoms have more than 83 protons, the electromagnetic repulsion between them is greater than the strong nuclear force of attraction between them. This makes the nucleus unstable, or radioactive, so it breaks down. The following video discusses the strong nuclear force and its role in the atom. The video also introduces the weak nuclear force, which is described next.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=41-LdIFvC9I(3:32)<h3 id=\"x-ck12-V2VhayBOdWNsZWFyIEZvcmNl\">\n",
      "      Weak Nuclear ForceThe weak nuclear force is transferred by the exchange of force-carryingfundamental particlescalled W and Z bosons. This force is also a very short-range force that works only within the nucleus of the atom. It is much weaker than the strong force or electromagnetic force that are also at work inside the atom. Unlike these other two forces, the weak nuclear force does not bind subatomic particles together in an atom. Instead, it changes subatomic particles from one type to another. TheFigurebelowshows one way this can happen. In this figure, an up quark in a proton is changed by the weak force to a down quark. This changes the proton (uud) to a neutron (udd).\n",

      "Answer: The detective might gather clues that provide evidence about the identity of the person who committed the crime. For example, he might find fingerprints or other evidence left behind by the perpetrator. The detective might eventually find enough clues to be able to conclude the identity of the most likely suspect.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SW5kdWN0aXZlIFJlYXNvbmluZyBpbiBTY2llbmNl\">\n",
      "      Inductive Reasoning in ScienceA simple example will help you understand how inductive reasoning works in science. Suppose you grew up on a planet named Quim, where there is no gravity. In fact, assume you’ve never even heard of gravity. You travel to Earth (on a student exchange program) and immediately notice things are very different here than on your home planet. For one thing, when you step out of your spacecraft, you fall directly to the ground. Then, when you let go of your communications device, it falls to the ground as well. On Quim, nothing ever falls to the ground. For example, if you had let go of your communications device back home, it would have just stayed in place by your upper appendage. You notice that everything you let go of falls to the ground. Using inductive reasoning, you conclude that all objects fall to the ground on Earth.Then, you make theobservationpictured (Figurebelow). You see round objects rising up into the sky, rather than falling toward the ground as you expect. Clearly, your first conclusion—although based on many pieces of evidence—is incorrect. You need to gather more evidence to come to a conclusion that explains all of your observations.Evidence that not everything falls to the ground on Earth.\n",

      "Answer: The symbol K stands for the element potassium. The symbol comes from the Latin name for potassium, which iskalium.The symbols in theFigureabovewould be more useful if they revealed more information about the atoms they represent. For example, it would be useful to know the numbers of protons and neutrons in the atoms. That’s where atomic number andmass numbercome in.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QXRvbWljIE51bWJlcg..\">\n",
      "      Atomic NumberThe number of protons in anatomis called itsatomic number. This number is very important because it is unique for atoms of a given element. All atoms of an element have the same number of protons, and every element has a different number of protons in its atoms. For example, all helium atoms have two protons, and no other elements have atoms with two protons. In the case of helium, the atomic number is 2. The atomic number of an element is usually written in front of and slightly below the element’s symbol, like in theFigurebelowfor helium.Atoms are neutral in electrical charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. Therefore, the atomic number of anatomalso tells you how many electrons the atom has. This, in turn, determines many of the atom’s properties.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TWFzcyBOdW1iZXI.\">\n",
      "      Mass NumberThere is another number in theFigureabovefor helium. That number is themass number, which is the mass of the atom in a unit called theatomic mass unit (amu). One atomic mass unit is the mass of aproton, or about 1.67 × 10-27kilograms, which is an extremely small mass. To better appreciate how small an atomic mass unit is, go to this URL:http://www.colorado.edu/physics/2000/periodic_table/atomic_mass.html.Aneutronhas just a tiny bit more mass than aproton, so its mass is often assumed to be one atomic mass unit as well. Because electrons have virtually no mass, just about all the mass of an atom is in its protons and neutrons. Therefore, the total number of protons and neutrons in an atom determines its mass in atomic mass units.Consider helium again. Most helium atoms have two neutrons in addition to two protons. Therefore the mass of most helium atoms is 4 atomic mass units (2 amu for the protons + 2 amu for the neutrons). However, some helium atoms have more or less than two neutrons. Atoms with the same number of protons but different numbers of neutrons are called isotopes. Because the number of neutrons can vary for a given element, the mass numbers of different atoms of an element may also vary. For example, some helium atoms have three neutrons instead of two. Therefore, they have a different mass number than the one given in theFigureabove.\n",
      "Question: What is the mass number of a helium atom that has three neutrons?\n",
      "Answer: The mass number is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons. For helium atoms with three neutrons, the mass number is 2 (protons) + 3 (neutrons) = 5.\n",

      "      Measuring Mass with a BalanceMass is the amount of matter in an object. Scientists often measure mass with a balance. A type of balance called a triple beam balance is pictured inFigurebelow. To use this type of balance, follow these steps:Place the object to be measured on the pan at the left side of the balance.Slide the movable masses to the right until the right end of the arm is level with the balance mark. Start by moving the larger masses and then fine tune the measurement by moving the smaller masses as needed.Read the three scales to determine the values of the masses that were moved to the right. Their combined mass is equal to the mass of the object.TheFigurebelowis an enlarged version of the scales of the triple beam balance inFigureabove. It allows you to read the scales. The middle scale, which measures the largest movable mass, reads 300 grams. This is followed by the top scale, which reads 30 grams. The bottom scale reads 5.1 grams. Therefore, the mass of the object in the pan is 335.1 grams (300 grams + 30 grams + 5.1 grams).\n",
      "Question: What is the maximum mass this triple beam balance can measure?\n",
      "Answer: The maximum mass it can measure is 610 grams (500 grams + 100 grams + 10 grams).\n",
      "Question: What is the smallest mass this triple beam balance can measure?\n",
      "Answer: The smallest mass it can measure is one-tenth (0.1) of a gram.To measure very small masses, scientists use electronic balances, like the one in theFigurebelow. This type of balance also makes it easier to make accurate measurements because mass is shown as a digital readout. In the picture, the balance is being used to measure the mass of a white powder on a plastic weighing tray. The mass of the tray alone would have to be measured first and then subtracted from the mass of the tray and powder together. The difference between the two masses is the mass of the powder alone.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TWVhc3VyaW5nIFZvbHVtZSB3aXRoIGEgR3JhZHVhdGVkIEN5bGluZGVy\">\n",

      "      Elasticity and Elastic ForceSomething that is elastic can return to its original shape after being stretched or compressed. This property is calledelasticity. As you stretch or compress an elastic material like a bungee cord, it resists the change in shape. It exerts a counter force in the opposite direction. This force is calledelastic force. The farther the material is stretched or compressed, the greater the elastic force becomes. As soon as the stretching or compressing force is released, elastic force causes the material to spring back to its original shape. You can watch a demonstration of elastic force at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFtM9JznLh8You can do some virtual bungee jumping at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eaICwFMHcaY\n",

      "Answer: After the bungee jumper jumps, he accelerates toward the ground due to gravity. Hisweightstretches the bungee cord. As the bungee cord stretches, it exerts elastic force upward against the jumper, which slows his descent and brings him to a momentary stop. Then the bungee cordspringsback to its original shape, and the jumper bounces upward.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VXNpbmcgRWxhc3RpYyBGb3JjZQ..\">\n",

      "Question: How does the resistance band work? How does it use elastic force?\n",
      "Answer: When you pull on the band, it stretches but doesn’t break. The resistance you feel when you pull on it is elastic force. The farther you stretch the band, the greater the resistance is. The resistance of the band to stretching is what gives yourmusclesa workout. After you stop pulling on the band, it returns to its original shape, ready for the next stretch.Springslike the spring toy pictured in theFigurebelowalso have elastic force when they are stretched or compressed. And like stretchy materials, they return to their original shape when the stretching or compressing force is released. Springs are used in scales to measureweight.

      "      Electric Potential EnergyElectric potential energy comes from the position of a charged particle in an electric field. For example, when two negative charges are close together, they have potential energy because they repel each other and have the potential to push apart. If the charges actually move apart, their potential energy decreases. Electric charges always move spontaneously from a position where they have higher potential energy to a position where they have lower potential energy. This is likewaterfalling over a dam from an area of higher to lower potential energy due to gravity.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Vm9sdGFnZQ..\">\n",

The source of voltage in the circuit is a 1.5-volt battery. The difference of 1.5 volts between the two battery terminals results in a spontaneous flow of charges, or electric current, between them.

The bus isn’t moving relative to them, and if they look at the other children sitting on the bus, they won’t appear to be moving either. If the ride is really smooth, the children may only be able to tell that the bus is moving by looking out the window and seeing you and the trees whizzing by.This example shows that how we perceive motion depends on our frame of reference.Frame of referencerefers to something that is not moving with respect to an observer that can be used to detect motion.

Calcium is also the most abundant metal in thehuman body, occurring as calcium compounds such as calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate. These calcium compounds are found inbonesand make them hard and strong. The skeleton of the average adult contains about a kilogram of calcium.

      "Answer: With just one valence electron, group 1 elements are “eager” to lose that electron. Doing so allows them to achieve a full outerenergy leveland maximum stability.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-UmVhY3Rpdml0eSBvZiBHcm91cCAxIEVsZW1lbnRz\">\n",
      "      Reactivity of Group 1 ElementsHydrogen is a very reactivegas, and the alkali metals are even more reactive. In fact, they are the most reactive metals and, along with the elements in group 17, are the most reactive of all elements. The reactivity of alkali metals increases from the top to the bottom of the group, so lithium (Li) is the least reactive alkali metal and francium (Fr) is the most reactive. Because alkali metals are so reactive, they are found in nature only in combination with other elements. They often combine with group 17 elements, which are very “eager” to gain an electron. At the URL below, you can watch a video that shows just how reactive the alkali metals are.http://youtu.be/uixxJtJPVXk(2:22)<h3 id=\"x-ck12-T3RoZXIgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBBbGthbGkgTWV0YWxz\">\n",

Some are even soft enough to cut with a knife, like the sodium pictured in theFigurebelow.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QSBDbG9zZXIgTG9vaw..\">\n",
      "      A Closer LookAlthough all group 1 elements share certain properties, such as being very reactive, they are not alike in every way. Three different group 1 elements are described in more detail below (Figuresbelow,below, andbelow). Notice the ways in which they differ from one another.Hydrogen has the smallest, lightest atoms of all elements. Pure hydrogen is a colorless, odorless, tastelessgasthat is nontoxic but highly flammable. Hydrogen gas exists mainly as diatomic (“two-atom”) molecules (H2), as shown in the diagram on the right. Hydrogen is the most abundant element in theuniverseand the third most abundant element on Earth, occurring mainly in compounds such as water.\n",
      "Question: Why do you think hydrogen gas usually exists as diatomic molecules?\n",
      "Answer: Each hydrogenatomhas just one electron. When two hydrogen atoms bond together, they share a pair of electrons. The shared electrons fill their only energy level, giving them the most stable arrangement of electrons.Potassium is a soft, silvery metal that ignites explosively in water. It easily loses its one valence electron to form positive potassium ions (K+), which are needed by all livingcells. Potassium is so important for plants that it is found in almost all fertilizers, like the one shown here. Potassium is abundant in Earth’s crust inmineralssuch as feldspar.Francium has one of the largest, heaviest atoms of all elements. Its one valence electron is far removed from thenucleus, as you can see in the atomic model on the right, so it is easily removed from the atom. Francium is radioactive and quickly decays to form other elements such as radium. This is why francium is extremely rare in nature. Less than an ounce of francium is present on Earth at any given time.\n",

      "      AM and FM RadioIn radio broadcasts, sounds are encoded in radio waves, and then the waves are sent out through the atmosphere from a radio tower. A radio receiver detects the waves and changes them back to sounds. You may have listened to both AM and FM radio stations. How sounds are encoded in radio waves differs between AM and FM broadcasts.AM stands foramplitudemodulation. In AM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the amplitude, or maximum height, of radio waves. AM broadcasts use longerwavelengthradio waves than FM broadcasts. Because of their longer wavelengths, AM waves reflect off a layer of the upper atmosphere called the ionosphere. You can see how this happens in theFigurebelow. Because the waves are reflected, they can reach radio receivers that are very far away from the radio tower.FM stands forfrequencymodulation. In FM broadcasts, sound signals are encoded by changing the frequency of radio waves. Frequency modulation allows FM waves to encode more information than does amplitude modulation, so FM broadcasts usually produce clearer sounds than AM broadcasts. However, the relatively short wavelengths of FM waves means that they don’t reflect off the ionosphere as AM waves do. Instead, FM waves pass through the ionosphere and out into space. This is also shown in theFigurebelow. As a result, FM waves cannot reach very distant receivers.\n",

      "Answer: One example is staying warm on a cold day. You will stay warmer if you can prevent the transfer of your own thermal energy to the outside air.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VGhlcm1hbCBJbnN1bGF0b3Jz\">\n",
      "      Thermal InsulatorsOne way to retain your own thermal energy on a cold day is to wear clothes that trap air. That’s because air, like other gases, is a poor conductor of thermal energy. The particles of gases are relatively far apart, so they don’t bump into each other or into other things as often as the more closely spaced particles of liquids or solids. Therefore, particles of gases have fewer opportunities to transfer thermal energy. Materials that are poor thermal conductors are calledthermal insulators. Down-filled snowsuits, like those in theFigurebelow, are good thermal insulators because their feather filling traps a lot of air.Another example of a thermal insulator is pictured in theFigurebelow. The picture shows fluffy pink insulation inside the attic of a home. Like the down filling in a snowsuit, the insulation traps a lot of air. The insulation helps to prevent the transfer of thermal energy into the house on hot days and out of the house on cold days. Other materials that are thermal insulators include plastic and wood. That’s why pot handles and cooking utensils are often made of these materials. Notice that the outside of the toaster pictured in the opening image is made of plastic. The plastic casing helps prevent the transfer of thermal energy from the heating element inside to the outer surface of the toaster where it could cause burns.

      "Question: If the fruit were at a lower level than the iron object, what would be the mass of the fruit?\n",
      "Answer: The mass of the fruit would be greater than 1 kg.Mass is commonly confused withweight. The two are closely related, but they measure different things. Whereas mass measures the amount of matter in an object, weight measures the force of gravity acting on an object. The force of gravity on an object depends on its mass but also on the strength of gravity. If the strength of gravity is held constant (as it is all over Earth), then an object with a greater mass also has a greater weight.\n",

      "      VolumeVolumeis a measure of the amount of space that a substance or an object takes up. The basic SI unit for volume is the cubic meter (m3), but smaller volumes may be measured in cm3, and liquids may be measured in liters (L) or milliliters (mL). How the volume of matter is measured depends on its state.The volume of aliquidis measured with a measuring container, such as a measuring cup or graduated cylinder.The volume of agasdepends on the volume of its container: gases expand to fill whatever space is available to them.The volume of a regularly shapedsolidcan be calculated from its dimensions. For example, the volume of a rectangular solid is the product of its length, width, and height.The volume of an irregularly shapedsolidcan be measured by the displacement method. You can read below how this method works. For a video on the displacement method, go to this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0geXKxeTn4.\n",

The salt will no longer be visible in the water, and it won’t settle to the bottom of the glass.ColloidsAcolloidis a homogeneous mixture with medium-sized particles. The particles are large enough to see but not large enough to settle or be filtered out of the mixture.The gelatin in this dish is a colloid. It looks red because you can see the red gelatin particles in the mixture. However, the particles are too small to settle to the bottom of the dish.SuspensionsAsuspensionis aheterogeneous mixturewith large particles. The particles are large enough to see and also to settle or be filtered out of the mixture.The salad dressing in this bottle is a suspension. It contains oil, vinegar, herbs, and spices.

      "Answer: Homogenized milk is a colloid. The particles in the milk are large enough to see—that’s why milk is white instead of clear like water, which is the main component of milk.

Examples of physical properties includeboilingpoint, ability to dissolve, and particle size. When components of mixtures vary in physical properties such as these, processes such as boiling, dissolving, or filtering can be used to separate them.Look at theFigurebelowof the Great Salt Lake in Utah. The water in the lake is a solution of salt and water. Do you see the white salt deposits near the shore? How did the salt separate from the salt water? Water has a lowerboilingpoint than salt, and it evaporates in theheatof thesun. With its higher boiling point, the salt doesn’t get hot enough to evaporate, so it is left behind.\n",

Therefore, it may be more useful to know how to calculate the net force acting on an object from its mass and acceleration. The equation for acceleration above can be rewritten to solve for net force as:Net Force = Mass × Acceleration, orF = m × aLook at Xander in theFigurebelow. He’s riding his scooter down a ramp.

      "      Single Replacement ReactionsA single replacement reaction occurs when oneelementreplaces another in a single compound. This type of reaction has the general equation:A + BC → B + ACIn this equation, A represents a more reactive element and BC represents the original compound. During the reaction, A replaces B, forming the product compound AC and releasing the less reactive element B.An example of a single replacement reaction occurs when potassium (K) reacts withwater(H2O). A colorlesssolidcompound named potassium hydroxide (KOH) forms, and hydrogengas(H2) is set free. The equation for the reaction is:2K + 2H2O → 2KOH + H2In this reaction, a potassiumionreplaces one of the hydrogen atoms in each molecule ofwater.

During the reaction, the ions B and D change places.\n",
      "Question: Could the product compounds be DA and BC?\n",
      "Answer: No, they could not. In an ionic compound, the positive metalionis always written first, followed by the negative nonmetal ion.

      "Answer: Natural causes can be investigated and understood, whereas gods or other supernatural causes are “above nature” and not suitable for investigation.Just a few hundred years after Thales, the Greek philosopher Aristotle made a very important contribution to science. You can see what Aristotle looked like in theFigurebelow. Prior to Aristotle, other philosophers believed that they could find the truth about the natural world by inwardreflection—in other words, just by thinking about it. Aristotle, in contrast, thought that truth about the natural world could come only from observations of nature andinductive reasoning. He argued that knowledge of nature must be based on evidence and logic. This idea is called empiricism, and it is the basis of science today.Aristotle introduced the idea of empiricism around 350 BCE. It is a hallmark of modern science.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SW50cm9kdWNpbmcgdGhlIFNjaWVudGlmaWMgTWV0aG9k\">\n",
      "      Introducing the Scientific MethodIn the first 1000 years CE, Europe went through a period called the Dark Ages. Science and learning in general were all but abandoned. However, in other parts of the world science flourished. During this period, some of the most important contributions to science were made by Persian scholars. For example, during the 700s CE, a Persian scientist named Geber introduced thescientific methodand experimentation in chemistry. His ideas and methods were later adopted by European chemists. Today, Geber is known as the “father of chemistry.”<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TW9kZXJuIFdlc3Rlcm4gU2NpZW5jZSBFbWVyZ2Vz\">\n",
      "      Modern Western Science EmergesStarting in the mid-1500s, a scientific revolution occurred in Europe. This was the beginning of modern Western science. Many scientific advances were made during a period of just a couple of hundred years. The revolution in science began when Copernicus made the first convincing arguments that thesun—not Earth—is the center of what we now call the solar system. (You can see both models of the solar system in theFigurebelow.) This was a drastic shift in thinking about Earth’s place in the cosmos. Around 1600, the Italian scientist Galileo greatly improved the telescope, which had just been invented, and made many important discoveries in the field of astronomy. Some of Galileo’s observations provided additional evidence for Copernicus’sun-centered solar system.The model on the left shows what people believed about the solar system before Copernicus introduced the model on the right.\n",
      "Question: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system were so influential that the scientific revolution is sometimes called the “Copernican revolution.” Why do you think Copernicus’ ideas led to a revolution in science?\n",
      "Answer: Copernicus’ ideas about the solar system are considered to be the starting point of modern astronomy. They changed how all future scientists interpreted observations in astronomy. They also led to a flurry of new scientific investigation. Other contributions to science that occurred during the scientific revolution include:Kepler’s laws of planetary motionNewton’s law of universal gravitationNewton’s three laws of motion<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RWluc3RlaW4gUm9ja3MgU2NpZW5jZQ..\">\n",
      "      Einstein Rocks ScienceAnother major shift in science occurred with the work of Albert Einstein (the “rock star” scientist pictured in the opening image). In 1916, Einstein published hisgeneral theory of relativity. This theory relates matter andenergy. It also explains gravity as a property of space and time (rather than a property of matter as Newton thought). Einstein’s theory has been supported by all evidence and observations to date, whereas Newton’s law of gravity does not apply to all cases. Einstein’s theory is still the accepted explanation for gravity today.\n",

      "Question: What is the name of the compound that contains three oxygen atoms and two nitrogen atoms?\n",
      "Answer: The compound is named dinitrogen trioxide. Nitrogen is named first because it is farther to the left in the periodic table than oxygen. Oxygen is given the-idesuffix because it is the second element named in the compound. The prefixdi-is added to nitrogen to show that there are two atoms of nitrogen in each molecule of the compound. The prefixtri-is added to oxygen to show that there are three atoms of oxygen in each molecule.In thechemical formulafor a covalent compound, the numbers of the different atoms in a molecule are represented by subscripts.

      "      Properties of Covalent CompoundsThe covalent bonds of covalent compounds are responsible for many of the properties of the compounds. Becausevalence electronsare shared in covalent compounds, rather than transferred between atoms as they are in ionic compounds, covalent compounds have very different properties than ionic compounds.Many covalent compounds, especially those containing carbon and hydrogen, burn easily. In contrast, many ionic compounds do not burn.Many covalent compounds do not dissolve inwater, whereas most ionic compounds dissolve well in water.Unlike ionic compounds, covalent compounds do not have freely moving electrons, so they cannot conduct electricity.The individual molecules of covalent compounds are more easily separated than the ions in a crystal, so most covalent compounds have relatively lowboilingpoints. This explains why many of them are liquids or gases at roomtemperature. You can compare the boiling points of some covalent and ionic compounds in theTablebelow.Name of Compound(Chemical Formula)Type of CompoundBoilingPoint (°C)Methane (CH4)covalent-164Nitrogen oxide (NO)covalent-152Sodium chloride (NaCl)ionic1413Lithium fluoride (LiF)ionic1676\n",

      "Answer: The reason is inertia.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-V2hhdCBJcyBJbmVydGlhPw..\">\n",
      "      What Is Inertia?Inertiais the tendency of an object to resist a change in its motion. All objects have inertia, whether they are stationary or moving. Inertia explains Newton’s first law of motion, which states that an object at rest will remain at rest and an object in motion will stay in motion unless it is acted on by an unbalanced force. That’s why Newton’s first law of motion is sometimes called the law of inertia. You can see an animation of inertia at this URL:http://www.physicsclassroom.com/mmedia/newtlaws/cci.cfm\n",
      "Question: You probably don’t realize it, but you experience inertia all the time, and you don’t have to ride a skateboard. For example, think about what happens when you are riding in a car that stops suddenly. Your body moves forward on the seat and strains against the seat belt. Why does this happen?\n",
      "Answer: The brakes stop the car but not your body, so your body keeps moving forward because of inertia.Inertia explains why it’s important to always wear a seat belt.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SW5lcnRpYSBhbmQgTWFzcw..\">\n",
      "      Inertia and MassThe inertia of an object depends on its mass. Objects with greater mass also have greater inertia. It would be easier for Lauren to push just one of her cousins on her skateboard than both of them. With just one twin, there would be only about half as much mass on the skateboard, so there would be less inertia to overcome.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-T3ZlcmNvbWluZyBJbmVydGlh\">\n",
      "      Overcoming InertiaTo change the motion of an object, inertia must be overcome by an unbalanced force acting on the object. The unbalanced force that starts Lauren’s cousins rolling along on the skateboard is applied by Lauren when she gives it a push. Once an object starts moving, inertia keeps it moving without any additional force being applied. In fact, it won’t stop moving unless another unbalanced force opposes its motion. For example, Lauren can stop the rolling skateboard by moving to the other end and pushing in the opposite direction.\n",
      "Question: What if Lauren didn’t stop the skateboard in this way? If it remained on a smooth, flat surface, would it just keep rolling forever?\n",
      "Answer: The inertia of the moving skateboard would keep it rolling forever if no other unbalanced force opposed its motion. However, another unbalanced force does act on the skateboard\n",
      "Question: What other force is acting on the skateboard?\n",
      "Answer: The other force is rollingfrictionbetween the skateboard’s wheels and the ground. The force of friction opposes the motion of the rolling skateboard and would eventually bring it to a stop without any help from Lauren. Friction opposes the motion of all moving objects, so—like the skateboard—all moving objects eventually stop moving even if no other forces oppose their motion.Later that day, Jonathan rode his skateboard and did some jumps. You can see him in the picturebelow. When he’s in the air, there is no rollingfrictionbetween his wheels and the ground, but another unbalanced force is acting on the skateboard and changing its motion.\n",

      "Answer: His action force will be greater, so the reaction force will be greater as well. Jerod will be pushed forward with more force, and this will make him go faster and farther.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RXF1YWwgYW5kIE9wcG9zaXRlIEZvcmNlcw..\">\n",
      "      Equal and Opposite ForcesThe forces involved in actions and reactions can be represented with arrows. The way an arrow points shows the direction of the force, and the size of the arrow represents the strength of the force. Look at the skateboarders in theFigurebelow. In the top row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders push against each other. This is the action. In the bottom row, the arrows represent the forces with which the skateboarders move apart. This is the reaction. Compare the top and bottom arrows. They point in different directions, but they are the same size. This shows that the reaction forces are equal and opposite to the action forces.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RXF1YWwgYW5kIE9wcG9zaXRlIGJ1dCBOb3QgQmFsYW5jZWQ.\">\n",
      "      Equal and Opposite but Not BalancedBecause action and reaction forces are equal and opposite, you might think they would cancel out, as balanced forces do. But you would be wrong. Balanced forces are equal and opposite forces that act on the same object. That’s why they cancel out. Action-reaction forces are equal and opposite forces that act on different objects, so they don’t cancel out. In fact, they often result in motion. Think about Jerod again. He applies force with his foot to the ground, whereas the ground applies force to Jerod and the skateboard, causing them to move forward.\n",

      "      How a Doorbell WorksTheFigurebelowrepresents a simple doorbell. Like most doorbells, it has a button located by the front door. Pressing the button causes two electric contacts to come together and complete an electriccircuit. In other words, the button is a switch. The circuit is also connected to a source ofcurrent, an electromagnet, and a clapper that strikes a bell. You can see an animation of a doorbell at this URL:http://www.schoolphysics.co.uk/animations/Electric_bell/index.htmlWhat happens when current flows through the doorbellcircuit?The electromagnet turns on, and itsmagnetic fieldattracts the clapper. This causes the clapper to hit the bell, making it ring.Because the clapper is part of the circuit, when it moves to strike the bell, it breaks the circuit. Without current flowing through the circuit, the electromagnet turns off, and the clapper returns to its original position.When the clapper moves back to its original position, this closes the circuit again and turns the electromagnet back on. The electromagnet again attracts the clapper, which hits the bell once more.This sequence of events keeps repeating.\n",

      "      Ethical Rules in ScienceEthics is an important consideration in science. Scientific investigations must be guided by what is right and what is wrong. That’s where ethical rules come in. They help ensure that science is done safely and that scientific knowledge is reliable. Here are some of the ethical rules that scientists must follow:Scientificresearchmust be reported honestly. It is wrong and misleading to make up or change research results.Scientific researchers must try to see things as they really are. They should avoid being biased by the results they expect or hope to get.Researchers must be careful. They should do whatever they can to avoid errors in their data.Researchers must inform coworkers and members of the community about any risks of theirresearch. They should do the research only if they have the consent of these groups.Researchers studying livinganimalsmust treat them humanely. They should provide for their needs and take pains to avoid harming them.Researchers studying human subjects must tell their subjects that they have the right to refuse to participate in the research. Human subjects also must be fully informed about their role in the research, including any potential risks. You can read about a terrible violation of this ethical rule in theFigurebelow.From the 1930s to 1970s, medical researchers (including the one pictured here) studied the progression of a serious disease in hundreds of poor men in Alabama. They told the men they were simply receiving free medical care. They never told the men that they had the disease, nor were the men treated for the disease when a cure was discovered in the 1940s. Instead, the study continued for another 25 years. It came to an end only when a whistleblower made it a front-page story around the nation.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-U2NpZW5jZSBhbmQgRXZlcnlkYXkgRXRoaWNhbCBEZWNpc2lvbnM.\">\n",

      "      Industrial RevolutionFew technologies have impacted society as greatly as the powerful steam engine developed by Scottish inventor James Watt in 1775 (seeFigurebelow). Watt’s steam engine was soon being used to power all kinds of machines. It started a revolution in industry. For the first time in history, people did not have to rely on human or animal muscle, wind, orwaterfor power. With the steam engine to power machines, new factories sprang up all over Britain.This is a museum model similar to the steam engine invented by James Watt.The Industrial Revolution began in Britain the late 1700s. It eventually spread throughout Western Europe, North America, Japan, and many other countries. It marked a major turning point in human history. Almost every aspect of daily life was influenced by it in some way. Average income andpopulationboth began to grow faster than ever before. People flocked to the new factories for jobs, and densely populated towns and cities grew up around the factories. The new towns and cities were crowded, and soot from the factories polluted the air. You can see an example of this in theFigurebelow. This made living conditions very poor. Working conditions in the factories were also bad, with long hours and the pace set by machines. Even young children worked in the factories, damaging their health and giving them little opportunity for education or play.Dozens of factory smokestacks polluted the air in the English city of Manchester in the 1800s.\n",

      "      Classes of LeversOther levers change force or distance in different ways than a hammer removing a nail. How a lever changes force or distance depends on thelocationof the input and output forces relative to the fulcrum. The input force is the force applied by the user to the lever. The output force is the force applied by the lever to the object. Based on the location of input and output forces, there are three basic types of levers, called first-class, second-class, and third-class levers. TheTablebelowdescribes the three classes.

The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were nofrictionto overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.\n",
      "Question: Which class of lever is a hammer when it is used to pry a nail out of a board? What is its mechanical advantage?\n",
      "Answer: To pry a nail out of a board, the fulcrum is located between the input and output forces. Therefore, when a hammer is used in this way it is a first class lever. The fulcrum is closer to the output force than the input force, so the mechanical advantage is &gt; 1.

      "      Comparing Classes of LeversAll three classes of levers make work easier, but they do so in different ways.When the input and output forces are on opposite sides of the fulcrum, the lever changes the direction of the applied force. This occurs only with first-class levers.When both the input and output forces are on the same side of the fulcrum, the direction of the applied force does not change. This occurs with both second-class and third-class levers.When the input force is applied farther from the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is greater than the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is greater than 1. This always occurs with second-class levers and may occur with first-class levers.When the input force is applied closer to the fulcrum than the output force is, the output force is less than the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is less than 1. This always occurs with third-class levers and may occur with first-class levers.When the input and output forces are the same distance from the fulcrum, the output force equals the input force, and the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. This occurs only with first some first-class levers.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QWR2YW50YWdlIG9mIFRoaXJkIENsYXNzIExldmVycw..\">\n",
      "      Advantage of Third Class LeversYou may be wondering why you would use a third-class lever when it doesn’t change the direction or strength of the applied force. The advantage of a third-class lever is that the output force is applied over a greater distance than the input force. The output end of the lever must move faster than the input end in order to cover the greater distance.\n",

      "Question: What would you expect to happen when the alpha particles strike the gold foil?\n",
      "Answer: The alpha particles would penetrate the gold foil. Alpha particles are positive, so they might be repelled by any areas of positive charge inside the gold atoms.Assuming a plum pudding model of the atom, Rutherford predicted that the areas of positive charge in the gold atoms would deflect, or bend, the path of all the alpha particles as they passed through. You can see what really happened in theFigureabove. Most of the alpha particles passed straight through the gold foil as though it wasn’t there. The particles seemed to be passing through empty space. Only a few of the alpha particles were deflected from their straight path, as Rutherford had predicted. Surprisingly, a tiny percentage of the particles bounced back from the foil like a basketball bouncing off a backboard!

      "Answer: Frost forms when the air is warmer than the ground. This is more likely to be the case in the fall. In the winter, the air is likely to be as cold as the ground.Deposition also occurs high above the ground whenwatervapor in the air changes to ice crystals. In the atmosphere, the ice crystals are deposited on tiny dust particles. These ice crystals formclouds, generally cirrus clouds, which are thin and wispy.

      "Answer: The vacuum cleaner is 10,000 times louder than the whisper!<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QW1wbGl0dWRlIGFuZCBEaXN0YW5jZQ..\">\n",
      "      Amplitude and DistanceThe intensity of sound waves determines the loudness of sounds, but what determines intensity? Intensity results from two factors: the amplitude of the sound waves and how far they have traveled from the source of the sound.Amplitude is a measure of the size of sound waves. It depends on the amount ofenergythat started the waves. Greater amplitude waves have more energy and greater intensity, so they sound louder. For a video demonstration of the amplitude and loudness of sounds, go to this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqfGYD2UKwAs sound waves travel farther from their source, the more spread out their energy becomes. You can see how this works in theFigurebelow. Asdistancefrom the sound source increases, the area covered by the sound waves increases. The same amount of energy is spread over a greater area, so the intensity and loudness of the sound is less. This explains why even loud sounds fade away as you move farther from the source.This diagram represents just a small section of the total area of sound waves spreading out from a source. Sound waves actually travel away from the source in all directions.\n",

      "Question: If you were to do an experiment to find out what influences thespeedof an object down a ramp, what would be the responding variable? How could you measure it?\n",
      "Answer: The responding variable would be the speed of the object. You could measure it indirectly with a stopwatch. You could clock the time it takes the object to travel from the top to the bottom of the ramp. The less time it takes, the faster the average speed down the ramp.\n",
      "Question: What variables might affect the speed of an object down a ramp?\n",
      "Answer: Variables might include factors relating to the ramp or to the object. An example of a variable relating to the ramp is its steepness. An example of a variable relating to the object is the way it moves—it might roll or slide down the ramp. Either of these variables could be manipulated by the researcher, so you could choose one of them for your manipulated variable.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RXhwZXJpbWVudGFsIENvbnRyb2xz\">Controlling VariablesAssume you are sliding wooden blocks down a ramp in your experiment. You choose steepness of the ramp for your manipulated variable. You want to measure how changes in steepness affect the time it takes a block to reach the bottom of the ramp. You decide to test two blocks on two ramps, one steeper than the other, and see which block reaches the bottom first. You use a shiny piece of varnished wood for one ramp and a rough board for the other ramp. You raise the rough board higher so it has a steeper slope (see sketch below). You let go of both blocks at the same time and observe that the block on the ramp with the gentler slope reaches the bottom sooner. You’re surprised, because you expected the block on the steeper ramp to go faster and get to the bottom first.\n",
      "Question: What explains your result?\n",
      "Answer: The block on the steeper ramp would have reached the bottom sooner if all else was equal. The problem is that all else was not equal. The ramps varied not only in steepness but also in smoothness. The block on the smoother ramp went faster than the block on the rougher ramp, even though the rougher ramp was steeper.This example illustrates another important aspect of experiments: experimental controls. Acontrolis a variable that must be held constant so it won’t influence the outcome of an experiment. The control can be used as a standard for comparison between experiments. In the case of your ramp experiment, smoothness of the ramps should have been controlled by making each ramp out of the same material. For other examples of controls in an experiment, watch the video at the URL below. It is Part II of the above video on bouncing balls.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LeqOQQRzCfo(5:44)\n",

      "      Seven Forms of EnergyThe different forms of energy are defined and illustrated below. For an interactive animation about different forms of energy, visit this URL:http://blip.tv/gatm/different-types-of-energy-647820.1. Mechanical energyis the energy of movement. It is found in objects that are moving or have the potential to move.This drummer has mechanical energy as he moves the drumsticks to hit the drums and cymbals. The moving drumsticks also have mechanical energy, but they would have mechanical energy even if they weren't moving. That's because they have the potential to fall when the drummer is holding them above the floor. This potential energy is due to gravity.2. Chemical energyis energy that is stored in the bonds between the atoms of compounds. If the bonds are broken, the energy is released and can be converted to other forms of energy.This portable guitar amplifier can run onbatteries. Batteries store chemical energy and change it to electrical energy.3. Electrical energyis the energy of moving electrons. Electrons flow through wires to create electriccurrent.The bright lights on this stage use electrical energy. They are wired into the electrical system of the of the hall. The guitars and microphone also use electrical energy. You can see the electrical cords running from them to the outlet on the floor below the musicians.4. Electromagnetic energyis energy that travels through space as electrical and magnetic waves. The lightfloodingthe stage in theFigureaboveis one type of electromagnetic energy. Other types includeradio waves,microwaves, X rays, andgamma rays.5. Thermal energyis the energy of moving atoms of matter. All matter has thermal energy because atoms of all matter are constantly moving. An object with more mass has greater thermal energy than an object with less mass because it has more atoms.Why is this jogger sweating so much? His sweat is soaking up his shirt because he has so much thermal energy. Jogging is hot work because of theheatfrom thesunand the hard work he puts into his run.6. Sound energyis a form of mechanical energy that starts with a vibration in matter. For example, the singer’s voice starts with vibrations of his vocal cords, which are folds of tissue in his throat. The vibrations pass to surrounding particles of matter and then from one particle to another in waves.Sound wavescan travel through air,water, and other substances, but not through empty space.7. Nuclear energyis energy that is stored in the nuclei of atoms because of the strong forces that hold thenucleustogether. The energy can be released innuclear powerplants by splitting nuclei apart. It is also released when unstable (radioactive) nuclei break down, or decay.\n",

      "Answer: A concave lens causes rays of light to diverge, or spread apart. It forms a virtual image on the same side of the lens at the object being viewed. Therefore, a concave lens would focus the image in front of the eye, not on the retina inside the eye. No signals would be sent to the brain so vision would not be possible.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IFdlIFNlZQ..\">\n",
      "      How We SeeThe ability to see is calledvision. This ability depends on more than healthyeyes. It also depends on certain parts of the brain, because the brain and eyes work together to allow us to see. The eyes collect and focus visible light. The lens and other structures of the eye work together to focus an image on the retina. The image is upside-down and reduced in size, as you can see in theFigurebelow.Cellsin the retina change the image to electrical signals that travel to the brain through the optic nerve. The brain interprets the electrical signals as shape,color, and brightness. It also interprets the image as though it were right-side up. The brain does this automatically, so what we see always appears right-side up. The brain also interprets what we are seeing.\n",

      "      Explaining Changes in Air Pressure with AltitudeThere are two reasons why air pressure decreases as altitude increases: density and depth of the atmosphere.Mostgasmolecules in the atmosphere are pulled close to Earth’s surface by gravity, so gas particles are denser near the surface. With more gas particles in a given volume, there are more collisions of particles and therefore greater pressure.The depth (distancefrom top to bottom) of the atmosphere is greatest at sea level and decreases at higher altitudes. With greater depth of the atmosphere, more air is pressing down from above. Therefore, air pressure is greatest at sea level and falls with increasing altitude. On top of Mount Everest, which is the tallest mountain on Earth, air pressure is only about one-third of the pressure at sea level.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IFdlIFVzZSBBaXIgUHJlc3N1cmU.\">\n",

That force is friction between the skateboard and the pavement. The force of friction is unbalanced because Nina is no longer pushing with her foot to keep the skateboard moving. That’s why the skateboard stops.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgRGlyZWN0aW9u\">\n",

Therefore, the mechanical advantage of a screw is always greater than 1.Look at the two screws in theFigurebelow. In the screw on the right, the threads of the inclined plane are closer together. This screw has a greater mechanical advantage and is easier to turn than the screw on the left, so it takes less force to penetrate the wood with the right screw.

      "      Atoms to IonsAtoms cannot only gain extra electrons. They can also lose electrons. In either case, they becomeions.

If atoms gain electrons, they become negative ions, or anions. Consider the example of fluorine (seeFigurebelow). A fluorine atom has nine protons and nine electrons, so it is electrically neutral.

      "Answer: Newton’s law allowed scientists to understand many different phenomena. It explains not only why things always fall down toward the ground or roll downhill. It also explains the motion of many other objects. For example, it explains why planets orbit thesun. The idea of universal gravity even helped scientists discover the planetsNeptuneand Pluto. The caption and diagram in theFigurebelowexplain how.In the early 1800s, astronomers noticed a wobble inUranus’ orbit around the sun. They predicted that the wobble was caused by the pull of gravity of another, not-yet-discovered planet. Scientists searched the skies for the “missing” planet. When they discoveredNeptunein 1846, they thought they had found their missing planet. After the astronomers took into account the effects of Neptune’s gravity, they saw that Uranus still had an unexplained wobble. They predicted that there must be another planet beyond Neptune. That planet, now called Pluto, was finally discovered in 1930. Of special note, as of 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) demoted Pluto from its planet status as it does not meet one of the criteria for planetary standards. For more information see:http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060821/full/news060821-11.htmlBaby steps in science occur as small bits of evidence gradually accumulate. The accumulating evidence lets scientists refine and expand on earlier ideas. For example, the scientific idea of theatomwas introduced in the early 1800s. But scientists came to understand the structure of the atom only as evidence accumulated over the next two centuries. Their understanding of atomic structure continues to expand today.The advancement of science is sometimes a very bumpy road. New knowledge and ideas aren’t always accepted at first, and scientists may be mocked for their ideas. The idea that Earth’s continents drift on the planet’s surface is a good example. This idea was first proposed by a scientist named Alfred Wegener in the early 1900s. Wegener also proposed that all of the present continents had once formed one supercontinent, which he named Pangaea (seeFigurebelow). Other scientists not only rejected Wegener’s ideas, but ridiculed Wegener for even suggesting them. It wasn’t until the 1950s that enough evidence had accumulated for scientists to realize that Wegener had been right. Unfortunately, Wegener did not live long enough to see his ideas accepted.This map shows the supercontinent Pangaea, which was first proposed by Alfred Wegener. Pangaea included all of the separate continents we know today. Scientists now know that the individual continents drifted apart to their present locations over millions of years.\n",

      "Answer: In beta-minus decay an atom gains aproton, and it beta-plus decay it loses a proton. In each case, the atom becomes a differentelementbecause it has a different number of protons.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RXF1YXRpb25zIGZvciBCZXRhIERlY2F5\">\n",
      "      Equations for Beta DecayRadioactive nuclei and particles are represented by nuclear symbols.. For example, a beta-minus particle (electron) is represented by the symbol. The subscript -1 represents the particle’s charge, and the superscript 0 shows that the particle has virtually no mass (no protons or neutrons). Another example is the radioactive nucleus of thorium-234. It is represented by the symbol, where the subscript 90 stands for the number of protons and the superscript 234 for the number of protons plus neutrons.Nuclear symbols are used to write nuclear equations for radioactive decay. Let’s consider the example of the beta-minus decay of thorium-234 to protactinium-234. This reaction is represented by the equation:→++ energyThe equation shows that thorium-234 becomes protactinium-234 and loses a beta particle and energy. The protactinium-234 produced in the reaction is also radioactive, so it will decay as well.A nuclear equation is balanced if the total numbers of protons and neutrons are the same on both sides of the arrow. If you compare the subscripts and superscripts on both sides of the equation above, you’ll see that they are the same.\n",

As she sits at the top of the hill, the child’s gravitational potential energy is:GPE = 140 N × 4 m = 560 N • mNotice that the answer is given in Newton • meters (N • m), which is the SI unit for energy.

It not only warms your hands. It also lets you light a match as shown in theFigurebelow. On the other hand, heat from friction between moving parts inside a car engine can be a big problem.

      "      Mass and Acceleration Due to GravityWhat if you were to drop a bowling ball and a soccer ball at the same time from the samedistanceabove the ground? The bowling ball has greater mass than the basketball, so the pull of gravity on it is greater. Would it fall to the ground faster? No, the bowling ball and basketball would reach the ground at the same time. The reason? The more massive bowling ball is also harder to move because of its greater mass, so it ends up moving at the same acceleration as the soccer ball. This is true of all falling objects. They all accelerate at the same rate due to gravity, unless air resistance affects one object more than another. For example, a falling leaf is slowed down by air resistance more than a falling acorn because of the leaf’s greater surface area.

In a crystal, many atoms are bonded together in a repeating pattern that may contains thousands of atoms. The arrangement of atoms in the crystal differs for each form of carbon and explains why the different forms have different properties.

      "      Water Pressure and DepthPressureis the amount of force acting on a given area. As you go deeper in the ocean, the pressure exerted by the water increases steadily. That’s because there is more and more water pressing down on you from above. TheFigurebelowshows how pressure changes with depth. For each additional meter below the surface, pressure increases by 10 kPa. At 30 meters below the surface, the pressure is double the pressure at the surface. At a depth greater than 500 meters, the pressure is too great for humans to withstand without special equipment to protect them. At nearly 11,000 meters below the surface, the pressure is tremendous. You can see a video showing changes in water pressure with increasing depth at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dL08xX4lBQg<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QWRqdXN0aW5nIHRvIENoYW5naW5nIFByZXNzdXJl\">\n",
      "      Adjusting to Changing PressureScuba divers can dive without special vehicles because they don’t go very deep below the surface of the water. Nonetheless, because of the pressure of the water, scuba divers who go deeper than about 40 meters must return to the surface slowly. They must stop for several minutes at one or more points in their ascent. That’s what the divers in theFigurebeloware doing. The stops are needed to let the pressure inside their body adjust to the decreasing pressure of the water as they swim closer to the surface. If they were to rise to the surface too quickly, the gases dissolved in theirbloodwould form bubbles and cause serious health problems.\n",

      "Question: Based on their position in the periodic table from theFigureabove, how many valence electrons do you think halogens have?\n",
      "Answer: The number of valence electrons starts at one for elements in group 1. It then increases by one from left to right across each period (row) of the periodic table for groups 1–2 and 13–18. Therefore, halogens have seven valence electrons.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q2hlbWljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw..\">\n",
      "      Chemical Properties of HalogensThe halogens are among the most reactive of all elements, although reactivity declines from the top to the bottom of the halogen group. Because all halogens have seven valence electrons, they are “eager” to gain one moreelectron. Doing so gives them a full outerenergy level, which is the most stable arrangement of electrons. Halogens often combine with alkalimetalsin group 1 of the periodic table. Alkali metals have just one valence electron, which they are equally “eager” to donate. Reactions involving halogens, especially halogens near the top of the group, may be explosive. You can see some examples in the video at the URL below. (Warning:Don’t try any of these reactions at home!)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mY7o28-l_WU(1:00)<h3 id=\"x-ck12-UGh5c2ljYWwgUHJvcGVydGllcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw..\">\n",
      "      Physical Properties of HalogensThe halogen group is quite diverse. It includes elements that occur in three differentstates of matterat roomtemperature. Fluorine and chlorine are gases, bromine is aliquid, and iodine and astatine are solids. Halogens also vary incolor, as you can see in theFigurebelow. Fluorine and chlorine are green, bromine is red, and iodine and astatine are nearly black. Like other nonmetals, halogens cannot conduct electricity orheat. Compared with most other elements, halogens have relatively lowmeltingandboilingpoints. You can watch a lab demonstration of the melting and boiling points of halogens at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yP0U5rGWqdg.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VXNlcyBvZiBIYWxvZ2Vucw..\">\n",

You can learn how it protects teeth at this URL:http://www.animated-teeth.com/tooth_decay/t4_tooth_decay_fluoride.htm.Chlorine is the active ingredient in household bleach. It removes stains from clothes. It can also be used to disinfect countertops and other surfaces.Bromine is used to purifywaterin swimming pools and hot tubs. It reacts withbacteriaand other germs and renders them harmless.Iodine is added to alcohol and used as an antiseptic. It reacts with germs on cuts and wounds. Small amounts of iodine are also needed for good health. In the U.S., iodine is added to table salt to prevent iodine deficiencies. Does the salt you use contain iodine?\n",

      "Answer: All of the hairs have all become negatively charged, and like charges repel each other. Therefore, the hairs are pushing away from each other, causing them to stand on end.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VHJhbnNmZXJyaW5nIEVsZWN0cm9ucw..\">\n",
      "      Transferring ElectronsThe girl pictured above became negatively charged because electrons flowed from the van de Graaffgeneratorto her. Whenever electrons are transferred between objects, neutral matter becomes charged. This occurs even with individual atoms. Atoms are neutral in electric charge because they have the same number of negative electrons as positive protons. However, if atoms lose or gain electrons, they become charged particles called ions. You can see how this happens in theFigurebelow. When anatomloses electrons, it becomes a positively charged ion, orcation. When an atom gains electrons, it becomes a negative charged ion, oranion.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q29uc2VydmF0aW9uIG9mIENoYXJnZQ..\">\n",
      "      Conservation of ChargeLike the formation of ions, the formation of charged matter in general depends on the transfer of electrons, either between two materials or within a material. Three ways this can occur are referred to asconduction, polarization, andfriction. All three ways are described below. However, regardless of how electrons are transferred, the total charge always remains the same. Electrons move, but they aren’t destroyed. This is thelaw ofconservationof charge.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q29uZHVjdGlvbg..\">\n",
      "      ConductionThe transfer of electrons from the van de Graaff generator to the man is an example ofconduction. Conduction occurs when there is direct contact between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. A van de Graff generator produces a negative charge on its dome, so it tends to give up electrons. Human hands are positively charged, so they tend to accept electrons. Therefore, electrons flow from the dome to the man’s hand when they are in contact.You don’t need a van de Graaff generator for conduction to take place. It may occur when you walk across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes. Wool tends to give up electrons and rubber tends to accept them. Therefore, the carpet transfers electrons to your shoes each time you put down your foot. The transfer of electrons results in you becoming negatively charged and the carpet becoming positively charged.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-UG9sYXJpemF0aW9u\">\n",
      "      PolarizationAssume that you have walked across a wool carpet in rubber-soled shoes and become negatively charged. If you then reach out to touch a metal doorknob, electrons in the neutral metal will be repelled and move away from your hand before you even touch the knob. In this way, one end of the doorknob becomes positively charged and the other end becomes negatively charged. This is called polarization. Polarization occurs whenever electrons within a neutral object move because of the electric field of a nearby charged object. It occurs without direct contact between the two objects. TheFigurebelowmodels how polarization occurs.\n",
      "Question: What happens when the negatively charged plastic rod in the diagram is placed close to the neutral metal plate?\n",
      "Answer: Electrons in the plate are repelled by the positive charges in the rod. The electrons move away from the rod, causing one side of the plate to become positively charged and the other side to become negatively charged.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RnJpY3Rpb24.\">\n",
      "      FrictionDid you ever rub an inflated balloon against your hair? You can see what happens in theFigurebelow.Frictionbetween the balloon and hair cause electrons from the hair to “rub off” on the balloon. That’s because a balloon attracts electrons more strongly than hair does. After the transfer of electrons, the balloon becomes negatively charged and the hair becomes positively charged. The individual hairs push away from each other and stand on end because like charges repel each other. The balloon and the hair attract each other because opposite charges attract.Electrons are transferred in this way whenever there is friction between materials that differ in their ability to give up or accept electrons. Watch the animation “Balloons and Static Electricity” at the following URL to see how electrons are transferred by friction between a sweater and a balloon.http://www.cabrillo.edu/~jmccullough/Physics/Electric_Forces_Fields.html\n",

      "Answer: Almost 97 percent of water on Earth’s surface is found as liquid salt water in the oceans. Thetemperatureover most of Earth’s surface is above thefreezingpoint (0°C) of water, so relatively little water exists as ice. Even near the poles, most of the water in the oceans is above the freezing point. And in very few places on Earth’s surface do temperatures reach theboilingpoint (100°C) of water.

      "      Weight and Buoyant ForceWeight is a measure of the force of gravity pulling down on an object, whereas buoyant force pushes up on an object. Which force is greater determines whether an object sinks or floats. Look at theFigurebelow. On the left, the object’s weight is the same as the buoyant force acting on it, so the object floats. On the right, the object’s weight is greater than the buoyant force acting on it, so the object sinks.Because of buoyant force, objects seem lighter in water. You may have noticed this when you went swimming and could easily pick up a friend or sibling under the water. Some of the person’s weight was countered by the buoyant force of the water.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RGVuc2l0eSBhbmQgQnVveWFudCBGb3JjZQ..\">\n",
      "      Density and Buoyant ForceDensity, or the amount of mass in a given volume, is also related to the ability of an object to float. That’s because density affects weight.

      "      TelescopeLike microscopes,telescopesuse convex lenses to make enlarged images. However, telescopes make enlarged images of objects—such as distant stars—that only appear tiny because they are very far away. There are two basic types of telescopes: reflecting telescopes and refracting telescopes. The two types are compared in theFigurebelow. They differ in how they collect light, but both use convex lenses to form enlarged images. You can learn more about telescopes and how they evolved in the video at this URL:http://www.videojug.com/film/how-does-a-telescope-work<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q2FtZXJh\">\n",
      "      CameraA camera is an optical instrument that forms and records an image of an object. The image may be recorded on film or it may be detected by an electronic sensor that stores the image digitally. Regardless of how the image is recorded, all cameras form images in the same basic way, as shown in theFigurebelow.Light passes through the lens at the front of the camera and enters the camera through an opening called the aperture.As light passes through the lens, it forms a reduced real image. The image focuses on film (or a sensor) at the back of the camera. The lens may be moved back and forth to bring the image into focus.The shutter controls the amount of light that actually strikes the film (or sensor). It stays open longer in dim light to let more light in.For a series of animations showing how a camera works, go to this URL:http://www.shortcourses.com/guide/guide1-3.html<h3 id=\"x-ck12-TGFzZXJz\">\n",
      "      LasersDid you ever see a cat chase after a laser light, like the one inFigurebelow? Alaseris a device that produces a very focused beam of visible light of just onewavelengthandcolor. Waves of laser light are synchronized so the crests and troughs of the waves line up. The diagram inFigurebelowshows why a beam of laser light is so focused compared with ordinary light from a flashlight.The followingFigurebelowprovides a closer look at the tube where laser light is created. Electrons in a material such as a ruby crystal are stimulated to radiate photons of light of onewavelength. At each end of the tube is a concave mirror. The photons of light reflect back and forth in the tube off thesemirrors. This focuses the light. The mirror at one end of the tube is partly transparent. A constant stream of photons passes through the transparent part, forming the laser beam. You can see an animation showing how a laser works at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUbBzEXlEho<h3 id=\"x-ck12-T3B0aWNhbCBGaWJlcnM.\">\n",
      "      Optical FibersBesides entertaining a cat, laser light has many other uses. One use is carryingcommunicationsignals in optical fibers. Sounds or pictures are encoded in pulses of laser light, which are then sent through an optical fiber. All of the light reflects off the inside of the fiber, so none of it escapes. As a result, the signal remains strong even over long distances. More than one signal can travel through an optical fiber at the same time, as you can see in theFigurebelow. Optical fibers are used to carry telephone, cable TV, and Internet signals.The optical fiber in the diagram is much larger than a real optical fiber, which is only about as wide as a human hair.\n",

      "Answer: The nucleus may be unstable because it has too many protons or an unstable ratio of protons to neutrons. For a nucleus with a small number of protons to be stable, the ratio of protons to neutrons should be 1:1. For a nucleus with a large number of protons to be stable, the ratio should be about 1:1.5.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QW4gRXhhbXBsZTogQ2FyYm9uLTE0\">\n",
      "      An Example: Carbon-14Find carbon in theFigurebelow, and you’ll see that itsatomic numberis 6. This means that all carbon atoms have 6 protons per nucleus. Almost all carbon atoms also have 6 neutrons per nucleus. These carbon atoms are called carbon-12, where 12 is the number of protons (6) plus neutrons (6). This gives carbon-12 nuclei a 1:1 ratio of protons to neutrons, so carbon-12 nuclei are stable.Some carbon atoms have more than 6 neutrons, either 7 or 8. Carbon atoms with 8 neutrons are called carbon-14 (6 protons + 8 neutrons). The nuclei of carbon-14 atoms are unstable because they have too many neutrons relative to protons, so they gradually decay.\n",

However, Schrödinger showed that you can at least determine where an electron is most likely to be.Schrödinger developed an equation that could be used to calculate the chances of an electron being in any given place around the nucleus. Based on his calculations, he identified regions around the nucleus where electrons are most likely to be. He called these regionsorbitals. As you can see in theFigurebelow, orbitals may be shaped like spheres, dumbbells, or rings. In each case, the nucleus of the atom is at the center of theorbital.

As a result, the carbon atoms are bonded to as many hydrogen atoms as possible. In other words, the carbon atoms are saturated with hydrogens. Saturated fatty acids are found in fats.Unsaturated fatty acids have at least one double bond between carbon atoms.

      "Answer: Most ocean waves are caused by wind blowing across the water. Moving air molecules transfer some of theirenergyto molecules of ocean water. The energy travels across the surface of the water in waves. The stronger the winds are blowing, the larger the waves are and the more energy they have.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IHRoZSBNZWRpdW0gTW92ZXM.\">\n",
      "      How the Medium MovesA surface wave is a combination of atransverse waveand alongitudinal wave. A transverse wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move up and down perpendicular to the direction of the wave. A longitudinal wave is a wave in which particles of the medium move parallel to the direction of the wave. In a surface wave, particles of the medium move up and down as well as back and forth. This gives them an overallcircular motion. You can see how the particles move in theFigurebelowand at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yPTa8qi5X8<h3 id=\"x-ck12-V2h5IFdhdmVzIEJyZWFr\">\n",

However, near the shore where the water is shallow, the waves behave differently. Look at theFigurebelow. You can see how the waves start to drag on the bottom in shallow water. This createsfrictionthat slows down the bottoms of the waves, while the tops of the waves keep moving at the samespeed. The difference in speed causes the waves to get steeper until they topple over and break. The crashing waves carry water onto the shore as surf.\n",

      "Answer: Gravity,friction, and applied forces all act on Carson’s scooter. Gravity keeps pulling both Carson and the scooter toward the ground. Friction between the wheels of the scooter and the ground prevent the scooter from sliding but also slow it down. In addition, Carson applies forces to his scooter to control itsspeedand direction.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Rm9yY2UgYW5kIE1vdGlvbg..\">\n",
      "      Force and MotionForces cause all motions. Everytime the motion of an object changes, it’s because a force has been applied to it. Force can cause a stationary object to start moving or a moving object to change itsspeedor direction or both. A change in the speed or direction of an object is calledacceleration. Look at Carson’s brother Colton in theFigurebelow. He’s getting his scooter started by pushing off with his foot. The force he applies to the ground with his foot starts the scooter moving in the opposite direction. The harder he pushes against the ground, the faster the scooter will go.How much an object accelerates when a force is applied to it depends not only on the strength of the force but also on the object’s mass. For example, a heavier scooter would be harder to accelerate. Colton would have to push with more force to start it moving and move it faster. You can explore the how force, mass, andaccelerationare related by doing the activity at this URL:http://www.harcourtschool.com/activity/newton/\n",
      "Question: What units do you think are used to measure force?\n",
      "Answer: The SI unit for force is the Newton (N). ANewtonis the force needed to cause a mass of 1 kilogram to accelerate at 1 m/s2, so a Newton equals 1 kg • m/s2. The Newton was named for the scientist Sir Isaac Newton, who is famous for his laws of motion and gravity.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Rm9yY2UgYXMgYSBWZWN0b3I.\">\n",
      "      Force as a VectorForce is a vector, or a measure that has both size and direction. For example, Colton pushes on the ground in the opposite direction that the scooter moves, so that’s the direction of the force he is applies. He can give the scooter a strong push or a weak push. That’s the size of the force. Like othervectors, a force can be represented with an arrow. You can see some examples in theFigurebelow. The length of each arrow represents the strength of the force, and the way the arrow points represents the direction of the force.\n",

      "      Force, Mass, and AccelerationWhenever an object speeds up, slows down, or changes direction, it accelerates. Acceleration occurs whenever an unbalanced force acts on an object. Two factors affect the acceleration of an object: the net force acting on the object and the object’s mass.Newton’s second law of motiondescribes how force and mass affect acceleration. The law states that the acceleration of an object equals the net force acting on the object divided by the object’s mass. This can be represented by the equation:or\n",
      "Question: While Tony races along on his rollerblades, what net force is acting on the skates?\n",
      "Answer: Tony exerts a backward force against the ground, as you can see in theFigurebelow, first with one skate and then with the other. This force pushes him forward. Althoughfrictionpartly counters the forward motion of the skates, it is weaker than the force Tony exerts. Therefore, there is a net forward force on the skates.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-RGlyZWN0IGFuZCBJbnZlcnNlIFJlbGF0aW9uc2hpcHM.\">\n",
      "      Direct and Inverse RelationshipsNewton’s second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration.The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a given force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force.\n",

      "      What Is a Machine?Amachineis any device that makes work easier by changing a force. Work is done whenever a force moves an object over adistance. The amount of work done is represented by the equation:Work = Force xDistanceWhen you use amachine, you apply force to the machine. This force is called the input force. The machine, in turn, applies force to an object. This force is called the output force. The output force may or may not be the same as the input force. The force you apply to the machine is applied over a given distance, called the input distance. The force applied by the machine to the object is also applied over a distance, called the output distance. The output distance may or may not be the same as the input distance.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IE1hY2hpbmVzIE1ha2UgV29yayBFYXNpZXI.\">\n",
      "      How Machines Make Work EasierContrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. For a humorous introduction to machines and how they make work easier, watch video chapters 1–3 at the following URL:http://schoolmediainteractive.com/view/object/clip/B658CEF884C8088A6B48EAA7DDA81CB8\n",
      "Question: If a machine increases the force applied, what does this tell you about the distance over which the force is applied by the machine:\n",
      "Answer: The machine must apply the force over a shorter distance. That’s because a machine doesn’t change the amount of work and work equals force times distance. Therefore, if force increases, distance must decrease. For the same reason, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SW5jcmVhc2luZyBGb3JjZQ..\">\n",
      "      Increasing ForceExamples of machines that increase force are steering wheels and pliers (seeFigurebelow). Read below to find out how both of these machines work.

      "      Increasing DistanceExamples of machines that increase the distance over which force is applied are leaf rakes and hammers (seeFigurebelow). Read below to find out how these two machines work. In each case, the machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, but it reduces the strength of the force.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q2hhbmdpbmcgdGhlIERpcmVjdGlvbiBvZiBGb3JjZQ..\">\n",
      "      Changing the Direction of ForceSome machines change the direction of the force applied by the user. They may or may not also change the strength of the force or the distance over which the force is applied. Two examples of machines that work this way are the claw ends of hammers and flagpole pulleys. You can see in theFigurebelowhow each of these machines works.

      "Answer: The strength of an acid or a base depends on how much of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q29uY2VudHJhdGlvbiBvZiBJb25z\">\n",
      "      Concentration of IonsThe strength of an acid depends on how many hydrogen ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger acid produces more hydrogen ions than a weaker acid. For example, sulfuric acid (H2SO4), which is found in carbatteries, is a strong acid because nearly all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. On the other hand, acetic acid (CH3CO2H), which is the acid in vinegar, is a weak acid because less than 1 percent of it breaks down into ions in water.The strength of a base depends on how many hydroxide ions it produces when it dissolves in water. A stronger base produces more hydroxide ions than a weaker base. For example, sodium hydroxide (NaOH), a base in drain cleaner, is a strong base because all of it breaks down into ions when it dissolves in water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO3), a base in antacids, is a weak base because only a small percentage of it breaks down into ions in water.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VGhlIHBIIFNjYWxl\">\n",
      "      The pH ScaleThe strength of acids and bases is measured on a scale called the pH scale, which is shown in theFigurebelow. By definition,pHrepresents theacidity, or hydrogenion(H+) concentration, of a solution. Pure water, which is neutral, has a pH of 7. With a higher the concentration of hydrogen ions, a solution is more acidic and has a lower pH. Acids have a pH less than 7, and the strongest acids have a pH close to zero. Bases have a pH greater than 7, and the strongest bases have a pH close to 14. It’s important to realize that the pH scale is based on powers of ten. For example, a solution with a pH of 8 is 10 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7, and a solution with a pH of 9 is 100 times more basic than a solution with a pH of 7.\n",

      "      Why pH MattersAcidity is an important factor for living things. For example, many plants grow best in soil that has a pH between 6 and 7.Fishmay also need a pH between 6 and 7. Certain air pollutants form acids when dissolved in water droplets in the air. This results in acidfogandacid rain, which may have a pH of 4 or even lower. The pH chart in theFigureaboveand theFigurebelowreveal some of the adverse effects of acidfogand rain.Acid rainnot only kills trees. It also lowers the pH of surface waters such asponds and lakes. As a result, the water may become too acidic forfishand other water organisms to survive.Acid fog and acid rain killed the trees in this forest.Even normal (clean) rain is somewhat acidic. That’s because carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air dissolves in raindrops, producing a weak acid called carbonic acid (H2CO3), which has a pH of about 5.5. When rainwater soaks into the ground, it can slowly dissolverocks, particularly those containing calcium carbonate. This is how water forms underground caves.\n",

The only exception is helium, which has just two electrons. But helium also has a full outerenergy level, because its only energy level (energy level 1) can hold a maximum of two electrons. A full outer energy level is the most stable arrangement of electrons. As a result, noble gases cannot become more stable by reacting with other elements and gaining or losing valence electrons. Therefore, noble gases are rarely involved in chemical reactions and almost never form compounds with other elements.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Tm9ibGUgR2FzZXMgYW5kIHRoZSBPY3RldCBSdWxl\">\n",

This is stated as the octet (“group of eight”) rule. According to this rule, atoms react to form compounds that allow them to have a group of eight valence electrons like the noble gases. For example, sodium (with one valenceelectron) reacts with chlorine (with seven valence electrons) to form the stable compound sodium chloride (table salt).

      "Question: Why does a helium balloon float away if it’s not weighted down?\n",
      "Answer: Helium atoms have just two protons, two neutrons, and two electrons, so they have less mass than any other atoms except hydrogen. As a result, helium is lighter than air, explaining why a helium balloon floats up into the air unless weighted down.Early incandescent light bulbs, like the one pictured in theFigurebelow, didn’t last very long. The filaments quickly burned out. Although air was pumped out of the bulb, it wasn’t a complete vacuum. Oxygen in the small amount of air remaining inside the light bulb reacted with the metal filament. This corroded the filament and caused dark deposits on the glass. Filling a light bulb with argongasprevents these problems. That’s why modern light bulbs are filled with argon.\n",

Most of them are white or silvery incolor, and they are generally lustrous, or shiny. The compounds that transition metals form with other elements are often very colorful. You can see several examples in theFigurebelow.Some properties of transition metals set them apart from other metals. Compared with the alkali metals in group 1 and the alkaline Earth metals in group 2, the transition metals are much less reactive.

      "      Radioisotopes and Radioactive DecayA radioisotope has atoms with unstable nuclei. Unstable nuclei naturally decay, or break down. They loseenergyand particles and become more stable. As nuclei decay, they gain or lose protons, so the atoms become different elements. This is illustrated in theFigurebelow. The original, unstablenucleusis called the parent nucleus. After it loses a particle (in this case a type of particle called an alpha particle), it forms a daughter nucleus, with a different number of protons.Thenucleusof a given radioisotope decays at a constant rate that is unaffected bytemperature, pressure, or other conditions outside the nucleus. This rate of decay is called thehalf-life. The half-life is the length of time it takes for half of the original amount of the radioisotope to decay to anotherelement.\n",
      "Question: How can thehalf-lifeof a radioisotope be used to date a rock?\n",

As they decay, the amount of the original, or parent,isotopedecreases, while the amount of its stable decay product, or daughter isotope, increases. By measuring the relative amounts of parent and daughter isotopes and knowing the rate of decay, scientists can determine how long the parent isotope has been decaying.

For example, the oldest rocks at the bottom of the Grand Canyon were dated by measuring the amounts of potassium-40 in the rocks. Carbon-14 dating, in contrast, is used to date specimens that are much younger than the rocks in the Grand Canyon.

      "      Focus on Carbon-14 DatingOne of the most familiar types of radioactive dating is carbon-14 dating. Carbon-14 forms naturally in Earth’s atmosphere when cosmic rays strike atoms of nitrogen-14. Living things take in and use carbon-14, just as they do carbon-12. The carbon-14 in living things gradually decays to nitrogen-14. However, as it decays, it is constantly replaced because living things keep taking in carbon-14. As a result, there is a constant ratio of carbon-14 to carbon-12 in organisms as long as they are alive. This is illustrated in the top part of theFigurebelow.After organisms die, the carbon-14 they already contain continues to decay, but it is no longer replaced (see the bottom part of theFigurebelow). Therefore, the carbon-14 in a dead organism constantly declines at a fixed rate equal to the half-life of carbon-14. Half of the remaining carbon-14 decays every 5,700 years. If you measure how much carbon-14 is left in afossil, you can determine how many half-lives (and how many years) have passed since the organism died. Carbon-14 dating is illustrated in the video at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udkQwW6aLik.\n",

      "      Factors That Affect ResistanceHow much resistance a material has depends on several factors: the type of material, its width, its length, and itstemperature.All materials have some resistance, but certain materials resist the flow of electric current more or less than other materials do. Materials such as plastics have high resistance to electric current. They are called electric insulators. Materials such asmetalshave low resistance to electric current. They are called electric conductors.A wide wire has less resistance than a narrow wire of the same material. Electricity flowing through a wire is likewaterflowing through a hose. More water can flow through a wide hose than a narrow hose. In a similar way, more current can flow through a wide wire than a narrow wire.A longer wire has more resistance than a shorter wire. Current must travel farther through a longer wire, so there are more chances for it to collide with particles of matter.A cooler wire has less resistance than a warmer wire. Cooler particles have less kineticenergy, so they move more slowly. Therefore, they are less likely to collide with moving electrons in current. Materials called superconductors have virtually no resistance when they are cooled to extremely low temperatures. You can learn more about superconductors at this URL:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x29bbd_superconductors_tech<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SXMgUmVzaXN0YW5jZSBHb29kIG9yIEJhZD8.\">\n",
      "      Is Resistance Good or Bad?Resistance can be helpful or just a drain on electrical energy. If the aim is to transmit electric current through a wire from one place to another, then resistance is a drawback. It reduces the amount of electrical energy that is transmitted because some of the current is absorbed by particles of matter. On the other hand, if the aim is to use electricity to produceheator light, then resistance is useful. When particles of matter absorb electrical energy, they change it to heat or light. For example, when electric current flows through the tungsten wire inside an incandescent light bulb like the one in theFigurebelow, the tungsten resists the flow of electric charge. It absorbs electrical energy and converts some of it to light and heat.What’s wrong with this picture? (Hint: How does current get to the light bulb?)\n",

The maximum number depends on the number of orbitals at a given energy level. Anorbitalis a volume of space within an atom where an electron is most likely to be found. As you can see by the images in theFigurebelow, some orbitals are shaped like spheres (S orbitals) and some are shaped like dumbbells (P orbitals). There are other types of orbitals as well.Regardless of its shape, eachorbitalcan hold a maximum of two electrons. Energy level I has just one orbital, so two electrons will fill this energy level. Energy level II has four orbitals, so it takes eight electrons to fill this energy level. The animation below shows the electrons in the first two energy levels for an atom of lithium, which has a total of three electrons.http://web.visionlearning.com/custom/chemistry/animations/CHE1.3-an-lithium.shtml\n",
      "Question: Energy level III can hold a maximum of 18 electrons. How many orbitals does this energy level have?\n",
      "Answer: At two electrons per orbital, this energy level must have nine orbitals.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VGhlIE91dGVybW9zdCBMZXZlbA..\">\n",
      "      The Outermost LevelElectrons in the outermost energy level of an atom have a special significance. These electrons are called valence electrons, and they determine many of the properties of an atom. An atom is most stable if its outermost energy level contains as many electrons as it can hold. For example, helium has two electrons, both in the first energy level. This energy level can hold only two electrons, so helium’s only energy level is full. This makes helium a very stableelement. In other words, its atoms are unlikely to react with other atoms.Consider the elements fluorine and lithium, modeled in theFigurebelow. Fluorine has seven of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level, which is energy level II. It would be more stable if it had one more electron because this would fill its outermost energy level. Lithium, on the other hand, has just one of eight possible electrons in its outermost energy level (also energy level II). It would be more stable if it had one less electron because it would have a full outer energy level (now energy level I).Both fluorine and lithium are highly reactive elements because of their number of valence electrons. Fluorine will readily gain one electron and lithium will just as readily give up one electron to become more stable. In fact, lithium and fluorine will react together as shown in theFigurebelow. When the two elements react, lithium transfers its one “extra” electron to fluorine.\n",

Instead, they consist of several kinds of smaller, simpler particles as well as a lot of empty space.

When they do, he surmised, they either bounce apart or stick together to form clumps of atoms. Eventually, the clumps could grow big enough to be visible matter.Dust motes dance in a beam of sunlight.\n",
      "Question: Which modern theory of matter is similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms?\n",
      "Answer: The modernkinetic theory of matteris remarkably similar to Democritus’ ideas about the motion of atoms. According to this theory, atoms of matter are in constant random motion. This motion is greater in gases than in liquids, and it is greater in liquids than in solids. But even in solids, atoms are constantly vibrating in place.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-V2h5IE1hdHRlciBWYXJpZXM.\">\n",

For example, he suggested that sweet substances are made of smooth atoms and bitter substances are made of sharp atoms. He speculated that atoms of liquids are slippery, which allows them to slide over each other and liquids to flow. Atoms of solids, in contrast, stick together, so they cannot move apart. Differences in theweightof matter, he argued, could be explained by the closeness of atoms. Atoms of lighter matter, he thought, were more spread out and separated by more empty space.\n",

When gas particlesheatup and gainenergy, they move faster. This causes more collisions and greater pressure. Therefore, heating particles of gas in a closed space causes the pressure of the gas to increase. Explore the behavior of gas particles at different temperatures at the following URL.

      "      Colors of ObjectsAn opaque object is one that doesn’t let light pass through it. Instead, it reflects or absorbs the light that strikes it. Many objects, such as the leaves pictured in theFigurebelow, reflect just one or a few wavelengths of visible light and absorb the rest. The wavelengths that are reflected determine the color that an object appears to the human eye. For example, the leaves appear green because they reflect green light and absorb light of other wavelengths.A transparent or translucent material, such as window glass, transmits some or all of the light that strikes it. This means that the light passes through the material rather than being reflected by it. In this case, we see the material because of the transmitted light. Therefore, the wavelength of the transmitted light determines the color that the object appears. Look at the beautiful stained glass windows in theFigurebelow. The different colors of glass transmit light of different colors.The color of light that strikes an object may also affect the color that the object appears. For example, if only blue light strikes green leaves, the blue light is absorbed and no light is reflected.\n",
      "Question: What color do you see if an object absorbs all of the light that strikes it?\n",
      "Answer: When all of the light is absorbed, none is reflected, so the object looks black. But black isn’t a color of light. Black is the absence of light.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VGhlIENvbG9ycyBXZSBTZWU.\">\n",
      "      The Colors We SeeThe human eye can distinguish only red, green, and blue light. These three colors are called theprimary colorsof light. All other colors of light can be created by combining the primary colors. Look at the Venn diagrambelow. Red and green light combine to form yellow light. Red and blue light combine to form magenta light, and blue and green light combine to form cyan light. Yellow, magenta, and cyan are called the secondary colors of light. Look at the center of the diagram, where all three primary colors of light combine. The result is white light. You can explore the colors of visible light and how they combine at this URL:http://www.phy.ntnu.edu.tw/oldjava/color/color_e.html<h3 id=\"x-ck12-UGlnbWVudHM.\">\n",
      "      PigmentsMany objects have color because they contain pigments. Apigmentis a substance that colors materials by reflecting light of certain wavelengths and absorbing light of other wavelengths. A very common pigment is the dark green pigment called chlorophyll, which is found in plants. Chlorophyll absorbs all but green wavelengths of visible light. Pigments are also found in many manufactured products. They are used to color paints, inks, and dyes. Just three pigments, called primary pigments, can be combined to produce all other colors. The primary colors of pigments are the same as the secondary colors of light: cyan, magenta, and yellow.\n",

      "      Energy and Ionic BondsIt takes energy to remove valence electrons from an atom because the force of attraction between the negative electrons and the positivenucleusmust be overcome. The amount of energy needed depends on the element. Less energy is needed to remove just one or a few valence electrons than many. This explains why sodium and other alkali metals form positive ions so easily. Less energy is also needed to remove electrons from larger atoms in the same group. For example, in group 1, it takes less energy to remove an electron from francium (Fr) at the bottom of the group than from lithium (Li) at the top of the group (see theFigureabove). In bigger atoms, valence electrons are farther from thenucleus. As a result, the force of attraction between the valence electrons and the nucleus is weaker.\n",

For example, you might travel 65 miles per hour on a highway but only 20 miles per hour on a city street (see the pictures in theFigurebelow.) You might come to a complete stop at traffic lights, slow down as you turn corners, and speed up to pass other cars.

A damaged electric cord can cause a severe shock if it allows current to pass from the cord to a person who touches it. A damaged cord can also cause a short circuit. A short circuit occurs when electric current follows a shorter path than the intended loop of the circuit. An electric cord contains two wires: one that carries current from the outlet to the appliance and one that carries current from the appliance back to the outlet. If the two wires in a damaged cord come into contact with each other, current flows from one wire to the other and bypasses the appliance.

You can learn more about electric safety features in the home by watching the video at this URL:http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x6fg5i_basics-of-your-home-s-electrical-sy_school.A Three-Prong Plug is used on metal appliances. The two flat prongs carry current to and from the appliances. The round prong is for safety. It connects with a wire inside the outlet that goes down into the ground. If any stray current leaks from the circuit or if there is a short circuit, the ground wire carries the current into the ground, which harmlessly absorbs it.Circuit Breaker: This electrical panel contains several circuit breakers. A circuit breaker is a switch that automatically interrupts a circuit if too much current flows through it. This could happen if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if too many electric devices are plugged into the circuit or if there is an electric short. Once the problem is resolved, the circuit breaker can be switched back on to complete the circuit so current can flow through it again.GFCI Outlet: GFCI stands for ground-fault circuit interrupter. GFCI outlets are typically found in bathrooms and kitchens where the use ofwaterposes a risk of shock (because water is a good electric conductor). A GFCI outlet contains a device that monitors the amount of current leaving and returning to the outlet. If less current is returning than leaving, this means that current is escaping. When this occurs, a tiny circuit breaker in the outlet interrupts the circuit. The breaker can be reset by pushing a button on the outlet cover.\n",

      "Answer: Like a tunnel through a mountain, a catalyst provides a faster pathway for a chemical reaction to occur.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-SG93IENhdGFseXN0cyBXb3Jr\">\n",
      "      How Catalysts WorkCatalysts interact with reactants so the reaction can occur by an alternate pathway that has a loweractivation energy. Activation energy is the energy needed to start a reaction. When activation energy is lower, more reactant particles have enough energy to react so the reaction goes faster. Many catalysts work like the one in theFigurebelow. (You can see an animated version at the following URL.) The catalyst brings the reactants together by temporarily bonding with them. This makes it easier and quicker for the reactants to react together. Notice how the catalyst is released by the product molecule at the end of the reaction.http://www.scs.sk.ca/cyber/elem/learningcommunity/sciences/chemistry30/curr_content/chem30/modules/module4/lesson5/explainingcatalysts.htm\n",

      "Answer: The catalytic pathway of the reaction requires far less energy. Therefore, the reaction will occur faster by this pathway because more reactants will have enough energy to react.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-Q2F0YWx5c3RzIGluIExpdmluZyBUaGluZ3M.\">\n",
      "      Catalysts in Living ThingsChemical reactions constantly occur inside living things. Many of these reactions require catalysts so they will occur quickly enough to support life. Catalysts in living things are calledenzymes. Enzymes may be extremely effective. A reaction that takes a split second to occur with an enzyme might take many years without it!More than 1000 differentenzymesare necessary for human life. Many enzymes are needed for the digestion of food. An example is amylase, which is found in the mouth andsmall intestine. Amylase catalyzes the breakdown of starch to sugar. You can see how it affects the rate of starch digestion in theFigurebelow.\n",

      "      Introducing Radioactive DecayRadioactive decayis the process in which the nuclei of radioactive atoms emit charged particles andenergy, which are called by the general termradiation. Radioactive atoms have unstable nuclei, and when the nuclei emit radiation, they become more stable. Radioactive decay is a nuclear—rather than chemical—reaction because it involves only the nuclei of atoms. In a nuclear reaction, oneelementmay change into another. For a fun introduction to radioactive decay, watch the short video at this URL:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-9yt7OAYmE<h3 id=\"x-ck12-VHlwZXMgb2YgUmFkaW9hY3RpdmUgRGVjYXk.\">\n",

      "      Types of PulleysSome pulleys are attached to a beam or other secure surface and remain fixed in place. They are called fixed pulleys. Other pulleys are attached to the object being moved and are moveable themselves. They are called moveable pulleys. Sometimes, fixed and moveable pulleys are used together. They make up a compound pulley. The three types of pulleys are compared in theTablebelow.

      "      Mechanical Advantage of PulleysThe mechanical advantage of a simple machine such as a pulley is the factor by which the machine changes the force applied to it. The ideal mechanical advantage of a machine is its mechanical advantage in the absence offriction. All machines must overcome friction, so the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world.In a pulley, the ideal mechanical advantage is equal to the number of rope segments pulling up on the object. The more rope segments that are helping to do the lifting work, the less force that is needed for the job. Look at the table of types of pulleys. It gives the ideal mechanical advantage of each type.In the single fixed pulley, only one rope segment pulls up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 1. In other words, this type of pulley doesn’t increase the force that is applied to it. However, it does change the direction of the force. This allows you to use yourweightto pull on one end of the rope and more easily raise the load attached to the other end.In the single moveable pulley, two rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2. This type of pulley doesn’t change the direction of the force applied to it, but it increases the force by a factor of 2.In a compound pulley, two or more rope segments pull up on the load, so the ideal mechanical advantage is 2 or greater than 2. This type of pulley may or may not change the direction of the force applied to it—it depends on the number and arrangement of pulleys—but the increase in force may be great.To learn more about the mechanical advantage of different types of pulleys, watch the video at this link:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yfAdmRJDKIc\n",

      "Answer: Vinegar is mostly water, so if you predicted that the speed of light through vinegar would be close to its speed through water, you are correct. The speed of visible light through Heinz® vinegar is about 230 million m/s.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-QmVuZGluZyBMaWdodA..\">\n",
      "      Bending LightWhen light passes from one medium to another, it changes speed. For example, when light passes from air to glass, it slows down. If light strikes a sheet of glass at a 90° angle, or perpendicular to the glass, it slows down but still passes straight through the glass. However, if light enters the glass at an angle other than 90°, the light bends as it slows down. The bending of light as it changes speed in a new medium is calledrefraction. TheFigurebelowshows how refraction occurs. Notice that the speed of light changes again as it passes from the glass back to the air. In this case, the speed increases, and the ray of light resumes its initial direction. For a more detailed explanation of refraction, watch this video:http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8RM46yvDOHI.<h3 id=\"x-ck12-V2hhdOKAmXMgWW91ciBBbmdsZT8.\">\n",
      "      What’s Your Angle?The angle at which light bends when it enters a different medium depends on its change in speed. The greater the change in speed, the greater the angle of refraction is. For example, light refracts more when it passes from air to diamond than it does when it passes from air to water. That’s because the speed of light is slower in diamond than it is in water.\n",

      "      WindWind is moving air, so it has mechanical energy that can do work. People have been using wind for energy for thousands of years. The old-fashioned windmill in theFigurebelowis one way that wind energy can be used. The wind turbines in the opening photo above are a much newer way of using wind energy. They change the kinetic energy of the wind to electrical energy. However, only certain areas of the world get enough steady wind to produce much electricity. Many people also think that wind turbines are noisy, dangerous to birds, and unattractive in the landscape.
