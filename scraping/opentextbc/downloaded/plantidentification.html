Humans depend almost entirely on plants for clean air and a livable climate as well as for food, medicines, materials, and well being. Around the world, groups of people with their own distinct history, culture, and society have learned to identify plants and their properties. For Indigenous peoples, the accumulated traditional knowledge of plants has allowed them to thrive in diverse environments for thousands of years.</p> <p>Traditional knowledge passed among generations through the oral traditions of hunter-gatherers influenced the naming and grouping of plants. With the settlement of agricultural communities and the domestication of plants about 10,000 years ago, written records documented their use. Early systems of plant classification emerged in Eastern and Ancient Egyptian cultures and botany, the scientific study of plants developed in Ancient Greece.</p> <p>Taxonomy, a branch of botany, is defined as the systematic classification, naming, and identification of plants. This orderly system arranges related plants with similar characteristics into groups called taxa and uses a convention called bionomial nomenclature to give a unique name to one group of plants. In addition to classification by morphology (external form) and anatomy (internal structures), botanists now use genetic sequencing and biochemistry to decode the evolutionary history of relationships among plants. As a discipline, taxonomy has continued to develop over centuries of botanical study and this knowledge is available to students of plant identification.</p> <p>The ability to identify plants and their requirements has always been an essential skill for horticulturists who manage plant growth and health. However, with more than 300,000 known species in the world, the plant kingdom – Plantae, is both diverse and complex. No two species of plants will be exactly alike, and while some common characteristics may be easily seen, others are so different that few if any relationships can be observed. Furthermore, the progression of evolution never stops and relationships among plant groups continue to change over time. To address this challenge, this book introduces students of plant identification to a systematic approach to classifying, naming, and identifying unknown species.</p> <h2>Review</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Theophrastus (370-285 BC), a Greek philosopher, first used taxonomy to describe and group plants according to their morphology (shape), growth, and reproductive traits. In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus applied binomials (two-term names) and classified known plants into a hierarchical system of classification.</p> <h2>Classification and Naming</h2> <p>The most effective classification systems are hierarchical and comprised of a nested series of categories or ranks. A good analogy is a computer filing system. Certain kinds of information reside at each level (drive, library, directory or folder, sub-directory, document, etc.), with file names (or labels) that signify the sort of information found there. Every level in the hierarchy is more inclusive than the one below it and the more of the filing system that is investigated, the more related information is uncovered.</p> <p>Similarly, the categories used in plant classification provide an organizational framework into which the names of naturally occurring plants are slotted. In this framework, species of plants that are most similar to each other are grouped together. Groups or taxa (plural) are arranged in a hierarchical sequence of taxons (singular), from least inclusive rank at the bottom to most inclusive rank at the top as shown below in the plant classification hierarchy. In other words, the taxa “family” may include numerous plant genera, and within a genus (singular of genera) there may be any number of species, whereas within a given species, a subspecies may describe only a few populations or individuals.</p> <p>Within taxa – family, genus, species, etc., there are identifiable characteristics common to each group. For example, plants in the cypress family typically have broad, flattened, scale leaves, while plants in the pine family exhibit needle-like leaves. Once organized into a sensible system that recognizes similarities or relatedness, the grouping becomes easier to understand and remember. That is, once characteristics for a given group are known, they can be used to match unknown plants with known taxons.</p> <h3>Plant Classification Hierarchy of Taxons</h3> <ul><li>Family</li> <li>Genus (plural = genera)</li> <li>Species</li> <li>Subspecies or Variety</li> <li>Forma</li> </ul> <h3>Other Classification terms</h3> <ul><li>Hybrid</li> <li>Cultivar</li> <li>Common Names</li> <li>Plant Groups</li> </ul> <h2>Review</h2> <p>Identify the hierarchy of plant taxons.</p> </div> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Family names always end with the suffix -aceae, except in a few notable cases where use of traditional names is also acceptable. Newer family names are based on the “type-genus” concept which means that for every family there is a genus that best represents the characteristics of the family. For example, </span><em style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">Brassica</em> <span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">(the cabbage genus) is the base for the family Brassicaceae, as is <em>Rosa</em> (the rose genus) for the family Rosaceae.</span></p> </div> <p>Older family names are still used since many are somewhat descriptive and may be more familiar than their newer counterparts. For example, Cruciferae (from the Latin crucifer, a cross) refers to the four-petal arrangement of flowers characteristic of the mustard family.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-introduction-to-binomial-nomenclature" title="Introduction to Binomial Nomenclature"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">4</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Introduction to Binomial Nomenclature</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Learning Objectives</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ul><li>Employ correct naming and plant identification terminology.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p>For an orderly system of classification, botanists give each group of plants a name that is recognized by people who know binomial nomenclature, regardless of where they are or the language they speak. This way every plant species will have a unique botanical name based on the binomial system of nomenclature. For example, one of the best-known trees of the Pacific Northwest, the Douglas fir, recognizes botanist Archibald Menzies in its scientific name <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em>. While the common name recognizes fellow botanist David Douglas, Archibard Menzies is credited with the first botanical description of the plant.</p> <p>A plant name or binomial is made up of two names: a genus name and a (usually) descriptive specific epithet (species name), both commonly of Latin or Greek origin. For example, of the many species within the group known as pines (genus = <em>Pinus</em>) there is only one named <em>Pinus contorta</em> (contorta = twisted). This species is characterized by often having contorted or twisted young shoots. The “species name” is the binomial; for instance, the species to which we belong is <em>Homo sapiens</em>.</p> <h2>Genus</h2> <p>A genus (plural = genera) is defined as an assemblage consisting of one or more related species that are more like each other than to other species, and that includes the entire surviving lineage of the ancestral population. Evidence for these relationships is deduced from the fossil record and from comparative techniques in morphological, chemical and molecular (DNA sequencing) analysis.</p> <p>A genus name can be descriptive of the plant, such as <em>Equisetum</em> (common horsetail) which is from two Latin words <em>equus</em> (horse) and <em>saeta</em> (bristle). The genus can be the actual Latin or Greek name such as <em>Erysimum</em> which is derived from the Greek name for the same plant <em>erysimon</em>. It can also be derived from the plant founder’s name such as <em>Davidia</em>, which is from Father David, a famous French plant explorer who lived in China for many years.</p> <h2>Species</h2> <p>The species is the basic life-unit in biology and can be defined as consisting of one or more related species that are more like each other than to other populations and that presumably come from a single ancestral population. The species name may be an adjective that indicates a distinguishing characteristic of the species, e.g., <em>Quercus alba</em> – white oak, or a noun that honors a person or indicates the species habitat. Species is abbreviated sp. (a single species) or spp. (more than one species).</p> <h2>Subspecies</h2> <p>Subspecies (ssp. or subsp.) and variety (var.) names are also multinomials. For example, lodgepole pine is known by the botanical name <em>Pinus contorta</em> var. <em>latifolia</em>, or sometimes, <em>P. contorta </em>ssp. <em>latifolia</em>. In other words, a northern variant of <em>Pinus contorta</em> with needles more flattened (lati = broad and folia = leaf) than the typical, coastal variety (<em>P. contorta</em> var. <em>contorta</em>). Note that “variety” is used here at the same rank as “subspecies” while some botanists consider the “variety” as a lower rank. These terms are used to describe naturally occurring plants.</p> <h2>Form</h2> <p>The rank form or forma (f. or fa.), is used to represent individuals which differ in some specific way from other individuals within the same natural populations. For example, one can find numerous red bract forms throughout populations of the more commonly white bract <em>Cornus florida</em> (Eastern flowering dogwood). These red bract dogwoods are correctly known as <em>Cornus florida</em> f. <em>rubra</em> (rubra = red). Other common, naturally-occurring mutations in other plants include: weeping habit (f. <em>pendula</em>), dissected leaves (f. <em>dissecta</em>), and white flowers (f. <em>alba</em>).</p> <h2>Hybrids</h2> <p>Hybrids are the offspring of successful mating between plants belonging to different taxa. Known interspecific hybrids (between species in the same genus) are designated by a multiplication sign, as <em>Platanus ×</em>&nbsp;<em>acerifolia</em> (<em>P. occidentalis</em> ×<em>&nbsp;P. orientalis</em>). Intergeneric hybrids result from crossing plants belonging to separate genera; an intergeneric hybrid name is always preceded by a multiplication sign, as ×<em>Solidaster</em> (<em>Solidago</em> ×&nbsp;<em>Aster</em>).</p> <h2>Cultivars</h2> <p>Cultivars are horticultural races or strains of plants which originate under cultivation or may originate in nature as a mutation and subsequently persist under human cultivation. The word cultivar (cv.) comes from “cultivated variety,” a somewhat confusing derivation, since the “variety” represents a naturally occurring entity, while the cultivar does not.</p> <p>As cultivars do not persist in nature, it is not a botanical designation; however, where used, the cultivar is considered part of the botanical name and must be appended to it. Cultivar names are distinguished in text using single quotation marks, as <em>Chamaecyparis pisifera</em> ‘Filifera Aurea’ (filaments or threads of gold).</p> <h2>Common names</h2> <p>Common names are the local, familiar names given to plants. The same common name may be used for several completely different plants. For example, the common name “cedar” is a name given to a variety of plants with aromatic wood (recalling the “cedar” of antiquity, <em>Cedrus</em> spp.) or to plants that are reminiscent of other plants called “cedars,” for example. In the Pacific Northwest, cedar refers to <em>Thuja</em> (western red cedar) and to <em>Cupressus</em> (yellow cedar).</p> <p>Similarly, a single species may have numerous common names, particularly if known from a variety of locations. For example, yellow cedar is also known as Nootka cypress and Alaska cedar. Clearly, there is potential for much confusion with common names. In text, common names are written out in lower case, except where they include proper names; e.g., Douglas fir, Japanese painted fern, etc. Common names are not botanical names. While botanical names are often, at least initially, difficult to remember and pronounce, they are universally recognized and considerably more accurate than common names.</p> </div></div>

The naming of plants is governed by two sets of published rules: The International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants and the International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants. These rules establish a worldwide standard of reference for naming plants. By convention, when written in text a botanical name is always italicized or underlined, and the first letter of the genus name is always capitalized.</span></p> <p>The following summarizes the basic rules regarding the writing of botanical names for plants:</p> <ul><li>The generic epithet of a botanical name is always capitalized (e.g., <em>Salvia, Impatiens),</em> and is underlined or italicized except where it is also used as a common name, as in salvia or impatiens. Within text or in a list – but only where unambiguous – the genus name is often abbreviated to the first letter, for example, <em>Rosa</em> <em>rugosa</em>, <em>R. moyesii</em>, <em>R. acicularis</em>.</li> <li>The specific epithet of a botanical name is always lower case, and is underlined or italicized in text, as <span style="text-decoration: underline">Gaultheria</span> <span style="text-decoration: underline">shallon</span> or <em>Gaultheria shallon</em>. If only the genus of a plant is known, the specific epithet is abbreviated as sp. (designating a single species) or spp. (more than one species).</li> <li>Hybrids, produced from breeding 2 or more different species (interspecific), are noted by a multiplication sign between the genus and specific epithet, for example, <em>Forsythia</em> × <em>intermedia</em>.</li> <li>Hybrids produced from crosses between genera (intergeneric), are noted by a multiplication sign before the genus, for example, ×<em>Solidaster luteus </em>which has the following parentage, (<em>Solidago canadensis</em> ×&nbsp;<em>Aster ptarmicoides</em>).</li> <li>Subspecies are abbreviated ssp. or subsp. The subspecies epithet is not capitalized but is underlined or italicized, for example <em>Acer glabrum</em> ssp. <em>douglasii</em></li> <li>Variety or more officially, varietas, is abbreviated var. The variety epithet is not capitalized but is underlined or italicized, as in this example, <em>Clematis</em> <em>montana</em> var. <em>rubens</em></li> <li>Form or more officially, forma, is abbreviated f. (or sometimes fa.). For example, <em>Cornus</em> <em>florida</em> f. <em>rubra</em>.</li> <li>Cultivars usually have vernacular names, are not italicized or underlined, and all words are capitalized and usually in single quotes. For example, <em>Astilbe</em> <em>chinensis</em> ‘Pumila’ or <em><span class="scientific1">Ilex aquifolium</span></em>&nbsp;<span class="scientific2">‘Ferox Argentea’</span>.</li> <li>Group: This describes a group of unnamed tree seedlings, for example <em>Picea pungens</em> Glauca Group describes all the un-named seedlings with blue foliage that are available in the nursery trade.&nbsp; Groups names are not italicized or underlined, and all words are capitalized but are not in single quotes.</li> <li>The ™ designation indicates that the originator of the new plant, for example, <em>Pyrus calleryana</em> Aristocrat™, has applied for a trademarked name. The ® indicates that the plant name is a registered trademark, such as in <em>Pyrus calleryana</em> Chanticleer®. The trademark name is often the “selling name” of the plant, which may differ from the cultivar name. eg. <em>Weigela florida</em> ‘Alexandra’ is sold under the moniker Wine &amp; Roses® weigela.</li> </ul> <h2>Review</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

All plants need water to survive and, based on how they move water, are categorized as either vascular or non-vascular. Vascular plants, such as trees, have a water conducting system, allowing them to supply aerial tissues with water and to grow well above the ground. Non-vascular plants rely on their closeness to water and their own physical absorption to support green tissues above ground. Mosses and liverworts are examples of non-vascular plants.</p> <p>Reproduction is another classification of vascular plants that is based on whether they reproduce themselves asexually or sexually. Vascular plants are subdivided into two major categories, pteridophytes, and spermatophytes. Pteridophytes (Greek for “fern plant”) include ferns and horsetails that reproduce asexually by spores. Spermatophytes (Greek for “seed plant”) include conifers and flowering plants that reproduce sexually by seed.</p> <p>Conifers, from the Latin for “cone-bearing” are woody plants that bear their female and male reproductive structures in separate cones or strobili rather than in flowers. Coniferous trees and shrubs typically bear both female and male cones on the same plant. Pollen produced by male cones is transported on wind currents to the female cones wherein seed development is completed. Conifers belong to the group of seed producing plants called gymnosperms. Gymnosperm literally means ‘naked seed’ as seeds are held on the surface of a cone scale or at the end of a small structure. This is the main differentiation between conifers and the flowering plants (angiosperms) which bear their seeds in an enclosed ovary of a flower that becomes the fruit.</p> <p>Angiosperms are the largest and most diverse group in the plant kingdom. Some angiosperms produce flowers and fruit over many years (polycarpic), while some die after flowering and bearing fruit only once (monocarpic). In addition to the presence of flowers and fruit, angiosperms are classified according to two major groups of plants that are each derived from a common ancestor species (clade), the monocotyledons and eudicotyledons. This classification is based on the number of cotyledons or seed leaves produced at seed germination. Monocotyledons (meaning “single seed-leaf”) include grasses, lilies, orchids, and palms. They develop from a seed with a single seed leaf. Some basic recognizable patterns of monocotyledons include leaf veins arranged in parallel lines; flower parts numbered in 3’s and a herbaceous plant structure. Eudicotyledons (meaning “true dicots”), are an evolutionary line that includes plants such as maples, oaks, roses, buttercups, mints, and sunflowers that develop from seed usually with a pair of seed leaves. Some basic recognizable patterns of dicotyledonous plants include leaves with netted venation; flower parts numbered in 4’s or 5’s and woody or herbaceous plant structure.</p> <p>Type of growth, such as tree versus shrub or woody versus non-woody (herbaceous), is often the first visual recognition of a plant. Plant growth may also be categorized by some aspect of their biology or ecology such as: terrestrial or aquatic habitat (e.g., duckweed), adaptations such as twining stems for climbing (wisteria) or underground storage bulbs (e.g., daffodil), or whether they exhibit seasonal loss of leaves (deciduous) or if they remain evergreen.</p> <p>Plant growth varies from trees with well-defined trunks, to multi-stemmed shrubs and climbers to spreading ground covers and clumping herbaceous plants. The above ground plant structure is typically formed by stems that are either woody or herbaceous. Woody plants such as cedars, oaks, and maples produce more or less permanent structures capable of extension and annual thickening (secondary growth). Non-woody or herbaceous plants such as dandelion, (eudicot) and grasses (monocot), and ferns, (pteridophyte) are limited to only extension growth and do not produce permanent above ground structures.</p> <p>The herbaceous growth habit is common among vascular plants, and many specific plant groups are distinguished on that basis. Herbaceous plants are characterized by a lack of woody tissue, such as bark. Their stems will eventually die back to a live root crown and root structures. Deciduous herbaceous perennials wither and die back to some kind of long-lived, resistant organ (a fleshy crown, bulb, tuber, rhizome, etc.) and enter a state of dormancy when conditions are not suitable for continued growth. In comparison, evergreen herbaceous plants have leaves that persist over one or more seasons of growth.</p> <p>Not all herbaceous plants are seed plants; spore producing plants such as ferns and horsetails are also considered herbaceous. The ability of some perennial plants to propagate themselves non-sexually by means of vegetative reproductive structures such as underground creeping stems (rhizomes) and tubers and bulbs is a competitive advantage over sexually reproduced plants and provides an effective adaptation for spreading.</p> <p>Plants with a climbing growth habit may be woody or herbaceous. Vines (herbaceous) and lianas (woody) have various specialized adaptations for climbing on, through, and over host plants and surrounding objects to gain access to light. Self-clinging climbers attach themselves to supports by aerial (adventitious) roots or by modified leaf structures called tendrils. Tendril climbers twine around or adhere themselves to supports by contact sensitive tendrils with adhesive discs at the tips. Climbers with twining stems or curling leaf stalks coil around supports in a clockwise or counterclockwise spiral habit. Scrambling (scandent) or trailing climbers with long arching stems attach loosely, if at all to supports. Some species, such as roses, are equipped with stem modifications of hooked thorns that allow them to scramble through other plants.</p> <h2>Review</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The ability to accurately distinguish and categorize the similarities and subtle differences among plant species relies on at least three interrelated skills: pattern recognition, description, and classification.</span></p> <p><span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">Pattern recognition</span> <span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">includes awareness of visual indicators such as shape, size, habit, etc. as well as other sensory input such as smell, touch, sound, etc. Much pattern recognition depends upon our ability to describe what is perceived. Frequently, people don’t remember those things they can’t describe in words. In contrast, those things, which are related to other more familiar things, are more easily recalled: for example, “it feels like velvet,” “it smells of lemons,” or “it appears to be bigger than a breadbox”.</span></p> <p><span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">Descriptions</span> <span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">allow people to identify and catalog those patterns. “Striped,” “spotted,” “rough” and “smooth” are simple descriptors. It is not difficult to remember such patterns. Other, more complex descriptors are needed for characterizing complex organisms. The “trick” is in recognizing the patterns that indicate important relationships. There is a significant amount of vocabulary involved in describing plants, and the student of plant identification must learn to apply both plant morphology (the study of shape) and the descriptive terminology.</span></p> <p>Classification <span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">is an effective method for organizing data. People naturally classify things according to various categories. Based on their usefulness, some plants may be considered more desirable than others. For example, plants considered to be undesirable for health or economic reasons are often categorized as weeds. Additional categories used for plant classification include their utility (medicinal plants), cultural tolerances (house plants), growth form (trees), leaf shape (needle vs. broad leaves), their assumed evolutionary relationships and genetic sequences (phylogenetics), among others.</span></p> <h2>Review</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-plant-life-cycles" title="Classify Plants by Life Cycle"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">10</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Classify Plants by Life Cycle</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Learning Objectives</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ul><li>Describe characteristics of plant life cycle classifications.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p>A plant will go through a sequence of stages from seed germination to seed production as a mature plant.&nbsp; For some plants, this sequence, or life cycle may take a few weeks&nbsp; while others continue to grow and flower repeatedly over many years. Plant life cycles are classified as annual, biennial, or perennial. Annuals complete their life cycle of germination from seed, growing, flowering, fruiting and dying within a single season of growth. Biennials require two seasons to complete their life cycle. In the first season, foliage production and storage of food reserves takes place followed by flowering, seed production and death in the next. Perennials typically flower annually once established and may live for several to a great number of years.</p> <h2 class="import-Normal">Types of Annuals</h2> <p>While the annual life cycle is completed within a single season of growth, the term annual or bedding plant may also be used to describe any plant that is grown outdoors in the spring and summer for one growing season.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Annual flowers differ in their tolerance to cold weather and frost. Hardy annuals are the most cold tolerant; they will take light frost and some freezing weather without being killed. In most cases, hardy annuals can be planted in the fall or in the spring before the last frost date. Examples of hardy annuals include <em>Lathyrus</em> (sweet pea), <em>Viola</em> (pansy), and <em>Tagetes</em> (marigold) cultivars. Most hardy annuals are not heat tolerant and usually decline and die with the onset of hot summer temperatures. Another type of hardy annual is the winter annual that germinates in the fall, overwinters as a rosette of leaves, and flowers in late winter and early spring. Species of <em>Stellaria</em> (chickweed) and <em>Cardamine</em>&nbsp;(snapweed) are examples of winter annuals.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Half-hardy annuals will tolerate periods of cold damp weather, but will be damaged by frost. Most half-hardy annuals can be seeded outdoors in early spring since they do not require warm soil temperatures to germinate. Seeds or plants are normally planted after the last spring frost. Examples of plants grown as half-hardy annuals are <em>Cosmos</em> (cosmos) and <em>Tropaeolum</em> (nasturtium). Some half-hardy annuals may decline in the midsummer heat but may re-bloom in late summer or fall.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Because most tender annuals are native to warm tropical regions of the world, they are sensitive to cold soil temperatures and are easily damaged by frost. Most seeds will not survive freezing soils temperatures and will not germinate when soil temperatures are below 15°C.&nbsp; It is recommended to wait two to three weeks after the last spring frost to sow seeds or transplant outdoors. Tender annuals include species of <em>Begonia</em> (begonia)and <em>Impatiens</em> (impatiens).</p> <p class="import-Normal">While some plants may be perennial in tropical regions, they are categorized as cool- or warm-season annuals when planted in colder regions. Cool-season annuals, such as <em>Pelargonium</em> (geranium)<em>, Petunia</em> (petunia), and <em>Antirrhinum</em> (snapdragon), grow best when temperatures are in between 20° and 25° C. during the day. Best flower production is in the spring and fall; flower production tends to decline in the middle of a hot summer. Warm-season annuals, such as <em>Zinnia</em> (zinnia) perform well when day time temperatures are between 26° and 32°C. and night time temperatures are between 15° and 20°C.</p> <h2>Biennials</h2> <p class="import-Normal">The life cycle of biennial plants is completed over two growing seasons. During the first season, they produce only leaves—usually in a rosette. Following a winter cold period, they flower in the second growing season, produce seeds, and then die. Popular biennials include <em>Digitalis</em> (foxglove) and <em>Oenothera</em> (evening primrose). Cultural practices are basically the same as for annuals, except that the plants are alive for two growing seasons.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Biennials present the obvious disadvantage of producing only foliage the first year. One solution is to sow biennial seeds in mid-summer so that the plants will develop during the summer and fall. After exposure to the winter cold, they will develop flowers in the spring.</p> <h2>Perennials</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Perennial plants can be either short-lived or long-lived herbaceous or woody plants. Short-lived herbaceous plants such as <em>Gaillardia</em> (blanket flower) may live for only a few years, or they can be long-lived like <em>Paeonia</em> (peony). Woody plants also classify as perennials, though they are rarely referred to as such. Woody species have stems that continue to grow, developing a permanent structure that the plant cannot ‘replace’ once removed. Some woody plants live tremendously long lives, such as the 9500 year old <em>Picea</em> sp. (spruce) in Sweden and British Columbia’s 1000 year old <em>Thuja</em> <em>plicata </em>(western red cedar)<em>. </em>Perennials that flower and fruit only once and then die are termed monocarpic<strong><em>. </em></strong>However, most perennials are polycarpic, flowering over many seasons in their lifespan.</p> <h2 class="import-Normal">Common hardy herbaceous plant families include:</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Asteraceae – sunflowers</p> <p class="import-Normal">Brassicaceae – mustards</p> <p class="import-Normal">Crassulaceae – sedums</p> <p class="import-Normal">Liliaceae – lilies</p> <p class="import-Normal">Lamiaceae – mints</p> <p class="import-Normal">Poaceae – grasses</p> <p class="import-Normal">Ranunculaceae – buttercups</p> <h2>Review</h2> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The typical dichotomous key, as shown in the example below, is made up of a series of descriptions, features or characteristics, arranged in pairs (couplets) of contrasting alternative choices (e.g., hairy vs. not hairy, bigger than a breadbox vs. not bigger than a breadbox, etc.). Each couplet is worked through sequentially until the correct determination is made.</p> <p>Starting at the first couplet, choose which of the two alternatives best suits an object or thing, and proceed to the couplet number or answer indicated by that choice. The number of things being considered is reduced at each successive step in the key so that by a process of elimination the correct determination is made.</p> <h2>Example Dichotomous Key</h2> <p>Example objects to identify: <strong>apple tree, water-lily, fir tree, dandelion, astroturf, seaweed</strong>.</p> <ul type="none"><li style="text-align: left;">1.a. found in water ………………………………………………………….. go to 2</li> <li style="text-align: left;">1.b. found on land …………………………………………………………… go to 3</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.a. grows in salt water ……………………………………………………… seaweed</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.b. does not grow in salt water …………………………………………….. water-lily</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.a. a real plant ……………………………………………………………… go to 4</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.b. not a real plant ………………………………………………………….. astroturf</li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.a. grows more than 50 m tall …………………………………………….. fir tree</li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.b. grows less than 50 m tall ……………………………………………….. go to 5</li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.a. produces yellow flowers ……………………………………………….. dandelion</li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.b. does not produce yellow flowers ……………………………………….. apple tree</li> </ul> <p>Or, the couplets may be grouped like this:</p> <ul type="none"><li style="text-align: left;">1.a. found in water ………………………………………………………….. 2</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.a. grows in salt water …………………………………………………….. seaweed</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.b. does not grow in salt water …………………………………………….. water-lily</li> <li style="text-align: left;">1.b. found on land ………………………………………………………….. 3</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.a. real plant ……………………………………………………………….. 4</li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.a. grows more than 50 m tall ……………………………………………… fir tree</li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.b. grows less than 50 m tall ………………………………………………. 5</li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.a. produces yellow flowers ……………………………………………….. dandelion</li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.b. does not produce yellow flowers ………………………………………. apple tree</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.b. not a real plant …………………………………………………………. astroturf</li> </ul> <p>Dichotomous keys may be simple or complex depending on what is being identified. For example, distinguishing obvious visible characteristics, such as structures for water movement in woody or herbaceous plant growth is straightforward. However, it should be noted that leaves, flowers, and fruit will not typically be available at the same time and return visits may be needed. Furthermore, differentiating minute plant parts such as reproductive structures requires the use of a hand lens or low magnification microscope for inspection and a thorough understanding of the descriptive terminology used in a dichotomous key.</p> <p>An example of a dichotomous key for plant identification is available online at this link to <a href="https://oregonstate.edu/trees/dichotomous_key.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://oregonstate.edu/trees/dichotomous_key.html"><em>Oregon State University Dichotomous Key</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="40-1"></span></span></p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='40-1'>https://oregonstate.edu/trees/dichotomous_key.html</div></div></div></div>

Plant stems with vascular tissue support leaves and reproductive structures such as flowers. Depending on the type of plant, stems may be woody or herbaceous, and solid or hollow in cross section.</p> <p>Herbaceous (non-woody) stems with solid or hollow stems are typical of forbs (eudicots), grasses, and grass-like plants called rushes and sedges (monocots). The stems are generally filled with a soft spongy tissue called pith, that stores and transports nutrients. The culm (stem) of a grass plant (<em>Poa</em> spp.) is hollow with pith only at the jointed nodes. The base of the leaf circles around the stem forming a series of overlapping sheaths. Sedges (<em>Carex</em> spp.), differ from grasses and rushes in that the stems are triangular (V-shaped) in cross section at the base (“sedges have edges”), have a solid pith, and are not jointed. Rushes differ from grasses in that stems are not jointed (no nodes) and are typically filled with pith.

Leaves arise at nodes just below an axillary bud on woody stems and are usually petiolate, that is composed of a blade and stalk-like petiole. Petioles may have stipules, two small leaf-like flaps that are attached at the base. In some cases, stipules on leaves and stems may become modified into spines, thorns, or prickles. Some leaves are sessile, that is, they lack petioles and have blades directly attached to the stem. When a bud is located in the axil of a single leaf and the stem, as shown in Figure 14.1 the leaf is classified as simple.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_53" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-49 size-medium" title="External features of a simple leaf" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Figure-14.1-Parts-of-a-simple-leaf-300x186.jpg" alt="Simple leaf" width="300" height="186" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Figure-14.1-Parts-of-a-simple-leaf-300x186.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Figure-14.1-Parts-of-a-simple-leaf-65x40.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Figure-14.1-Parts-of-a-simple-leaf-225x140.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Figure-14.1-Parts-of-a-simple-leaf.jpg 322w" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-53">Figure 14.1 Parts of a simple leaf</div></div> <p>However, when a bud is located in the axil of a structure with more than one leaf (leaflet) on attached to the axis (rachis), the leaf is classified as compound. As shown in Figure 14.2, even or odd numbers of leaflets may be pinnately compound that is, arranged along a central axis (feather-like), or palmately compound from one point on the tip of the petiole, (like fingers on an out-stretched hand).

Figure 14.3&nbsp; illustrates common leaf arrangements where leaves and buds on a stem are opposite (directly across from each other on the stem), alternate (spaced alternately along the stem axis), whorled (three or more leaves and buds are positioned at a node), or basal (emerging from the base).

In eudicot plants, leaf venation is typically either pinnate or palmate and may have multiple branching that gives an overall netted appearance. In contrast, monocots will have parallel leaf venation. Additional morphological features for description include leaf shape, tip and base features, and margins (edges). Leaf surface characteristics vary and some may be smooth (glabrous) or with hairs (hirsute or pubescent), wrinkles (rugose), pustules (verrucose) or other interruptions of the surface.

The awl-shape and scale-like foliage of <em>Juniperus</em> spp. exhibits leaf dimorphism where a juvenile leaf form differs from the mature leaves of the same plant.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_56" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56" style="width: 567px"><img class="wp-image-56 size-full" title="Types of conifer leaves" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2.jpg" alt="Types of conifer leaves with terms below: needles borne singly on shoot, scale-like, awl-shape" width="567" height="286" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2.jpg 567w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2-300x151.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2-65x33.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2-225x113.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Conifer-leaves-2-350x177.jpg 350w" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-56"><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 15.1 Types of conifer leaves.</span></div></div> <h2>Dichotomous Key for Some Common Conifers</h2> <p>Click the links for plant images.</p> <ul type="none"><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ul type="none"><li style="text-align: left;">1.a. leaves long, needle-like ……………………………………………….. go to 2</li> <li style="text-align: left;">1.b. leaves lanceolate, awl or scale-like, overlapping, not needle-like ……………………………………………………………………………… go to 5</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.a. needles in bundles or tufts …………………………………………….. go to 3</li> <li style="text-align: left;">2.b. needles borne singly …………………………………………………… go to 7</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.a. needles in bundles of 2 to 5 ……………………………………………. go to 4</li> <li style="text-align: left;">3.b. needles deciduous, many in a tuft ……………….. <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/91?image=l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/91?image=l"><em>Larix</em> <em>decidua </em>[New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="57-1"></span></span></li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.a. 5 needles per bundle ……………………………… <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/1608?image=h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/1608?image=h"><em>Pinus</em><em>strobus </em>[New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="57-2"></span></span></li> <li style="text-align: left;">4.b. 2 needles per bundle …………………………………………………. go to 10</li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.a. scales imbricate (overlapping) cones small, upright… <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/178?image=h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/plantImages/178?image=h"><em>Thuja</em><em>plicata </em>[New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="57-3"></span></span></li> <li style="text-align: left;">5.b. scales imbricate, cones spherical or oval, opening along sutures at maturity ………………………………………………………………………………. go to 6</li> <li style="text-align: left;">6.a. cones small, spherical;

Flower parts may be fused or separate and usually exhibit radial (star-shaped) symmetry or bilateral (two-mirror image halves) symmetry as shown in Figure 16.2.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1349" title="Flower parts and symmetry" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Flower-parts-and-symmetry-1-2.jpg" alt="Flower parts (stamen, carpel (pistil), petal (part of corolla), receptacle, peduncle, sepal (part of calyx) and symmetry (radial symmetry, bilateral symmetry)" width="500" height="176" /><div class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 16.2 Flower parts and symmetry.</span></div></div> <p>In addition to their shape, flowers are often differentiated by further dissections of their structure. For example, complete flowers must have all four main flower parts: sepals, petals, stamens (male) and pistils (female), while incomplete flowers will be missing one or more of these parts. Most flowering plants have perfect flowers that contain both male and female reproductive parts. However, some have imperfect flowers that contain only the male or female part (stamen or pistil) and may or may not contain sepals or petals. A species may have individual plants that are dioecious, producing either male or female flowers or cones on separate plants. Plants that are monoecious&nbsp; produce both female and male flowers and cones on one plant.

The seed develops within the ovary which is part of the pistil, a female reproductive organ of the flower. The expanded and ripened ovary is referred to as the fruit. Commonly, the enlarged ovary becomes the edible portion of the fruit.</p> <p>Fruits are classified into one of three main groups: simple, aggregate, or multiple, as shown in Figure 16.4 and Figure 16.5. Simple fruits, which form from a single, ripened ovary, may be either fleshy or dry. Fleshy fruits include the berry (grape), pepo (pumpkin), hesperidium (orange), drupe (plum), and pome (apple). Aggregate fruit develop from a single flower with numerous pistils. Once fertilized, the individual pistils develop into tiny fruitlets clustered on a single receptacle, as in a raspberry or blackberry. Multiple fruits, such as pineapples, form when numerous fertilized flowers in a single inflorescence develop together into a larger fruit.</p> <p>Dry fruits,&nbsp; are either dehiscent (split open at maturity) or indehiscent (remain closed at maturity). Dry fruits that split at maturity include the legume (pea), silique (mustard), follicle (milkweed), and capsule (cotton). Dry fruits that do not split at maturity include the achene (sunflower), nut (pecan, almond), grain (corn), samara (ash), and schizocarp (geranium, carrot).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" style="width: 571px"><img class="wp-image-62 size-full" title="Fruit types" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Fruit-Types.jpg" alt="Fruit types with numbers below, 1 to 15.

Genera that share similar structures are grouped within a particular family. While some plant families, such as Orchidaceae (orchid) and Asteraceae (sunflower family) have several hundred members, others such as Ginkgoaceae (ginkgo) have a single member. As the group with the greatest number of closely related plants, the family taxon provides a starting point for narrowing the search for an unknown plant. In addition to shared morphological characteristics, the family taxon provides information about evolutionary adaptations for growth conditions as well as methods for propagation. One of the most comprehensive references for angiosperms is Flowering Plant Families of the World by V. H. Heywood (2007).&nbsp; The morphological characteristics for some families and genera commonly found in landscapes and gardens are summarized below.

Most of its members are evergreen shrubs or subshrubs or perennial rhizomatous herbs, but tap-rooted or tuberous-rooted perennials, and biennial and annual herbs are also frequent. Common genera of this family include:</p> <ul><li><em>Achillea</em> (yarrow)</li> <li><em>Dahlia </em>(dahlia)</li> <li><em>Jacobaea</em> (dusty miller)</li> <li><em>Leucanthemum</em> (daisy)</li> <li><em>Symphyotrichum </em>(aster)</li> <li><em>Taraxacum </em>(dandelion)</li> </ul> <p>Key identifying characteristics for Asteraceae include an inflorescence that is a composite head with disc florets, (ray florets may or may not be present), and an achene-like cypsela (fruit) with a fringe of hairs or papus. The leaf arrangement may be alternate or opposite, though rarely whorled. Leaf blades are often lobed or toothed and pinnately or palmately veined.</p> <h2>Caryophyllaceae&nbsp; – pink, carnation family</h2> <p>The pink or carnation family,&nbsp;Caryophyllaceae<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is a large family of temperate eudicots that are mostly annual, biennial, or perennial herbs and a few subshrubs with woody stems. Many members are flowering ornamentals and some, such as <em>Cerastium</em> may be weedy. Common genera include:</p> <ul><li><em>Cerastium </em>(snow-in-summer)</li> <li><em>Dianthus </em>(pinks, carnations)</li> <li><em>Lychnis </em>(campions)</li> <li><em>Silene </em>(catchflies)</li> </ul> <p>Species in Caryophyllaceae are relatively uniform and recognized by non-succulent stems, swollen stem nodes, and opposite leaves (rarely whorled). Leaf blades are typically simple, lanceolate with entire margins, and without stipules. Flowers are often white or pink, with 4 or 5 petals, and 5 sepals. Petals may be entire, fringed, or deeply cleft and sepals may be free or united. There are usually 5-10 stamens or more and the carpels are united in a common superior ovary. Flowers are terminal and bloom singly or branched in cymes. In some species such as <em>Silene </em>spp., the calyx may be cylindrical and inflated. The fruit is a capsule with many seeds.</p> <h2>Ericaceae – heather family</h2> <p>One of the most common groups of plants in the British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest (PNW) is the heather family, Ericaceae. Family members are mostly temperate woody shrubs and trees, and rarely herbs. Species of <em>Arbutus</em>, <em>Arctostaphylos</em> and <em>Gaultheria</em> are indigenous to the PNW. Some common genera in the Ericaceae family include:</p> <ul><li><em>Calluna</em> (heather)</li> <li><em>Erica</em> (heather or heath)</li> <li><em>Pieris</em> (lily-of-the-valley shrub)</li> <li><em>Rhododendron</em> (including azaleas and rhododendrons)</li> <li><em>Vaccinium</em> (huckleberries and cranberries)</li> </ul> <p>For the most part, ericaceous plants have urn-shaped flowers borne in racemes or panicles. <em>Rhododendron</em> is an exception; they have relatively open, bell-shaped flowers in short racemes (trusses). Other shared characteristics include: fine, off-white shallow roots, an affinity for acid soils, leathery leaves arranged alternately or appearing terminally whorled, rough or peeling bark, and dense wood. While many members are deciduous, genera in this family are among the most recognizable of broadleaf evergreens, both in and out of flower.</p> <h2>Lamiaceae – mint family</h2> <p>The mint family,&nbsp;Lamiaceae<strong>&nbsp;</strong>is easily recognized because its members exhibit square stems, opposite, often decussate (4-ranked) leaf arrangement, and distinctive two-lipped flowers held in verticillasters (pairs of axillary cymes arising from opposite leaves or bracts and forming a false whorl). The fruit is a nutlet. Family members may be annual or perennial, and are often subshrubs (woody base with soft wooded stems) or entirely herbaceous. Many are highly aromatic, vigorous growers and adapted to propagate easily from stem-cuttings. There are a number of broadleaf evergreen members in Lamiaceae, as listed below:</p> <ul><li><em>Ajuga</em> (carpet-bugle)</li> <li><em>Lamium</em> (dead nettle)</li> <li><em>Lavandula</em> (lavender)</li> <li><em>Rosmarinus</em> (rosemary)</li> <li><em>Salvia</em> (sage)</li> <li><em>Thymus</em> (thyme)</li> </ul> <h2>Liliaceae – lily family</h2> <p>Members of the the lily family, Liliaceae are typically perennial herbaceous monocots that grow from bulbs or rhizomes. Leaves are basal, alternate, and sometimes whorled in arrangement with parallel venation.&nbsp; The inflorescence is a raceme or solitary flower. Flowers are radially symmetrical with parts occurring in 3’s, and separate but undifferentiated sepals and petals (tepals) that may be spotted or striped. The fruit is a capsule. Some of the genera in the lily family include:</p> <ul><li><em>Erythronium</em> (fawn lily)</li> <li><em>Fritillaria</em> (chocolate lily)</li> <li><em>Lilium</em> (lily)</li> <li><em>Tulipa</em> (tulip)</li> </ul> <h2>Ranunculaceae – buttercup family</h2> <p>The buttercup family, Ranunculaceae is composed of herbaceous annuals or perennials, woody shrubs, and lianas.&nbsp; Leaves are typically alternate, sometimes opposite in arrangement, and simple or compound with lobed or dissected margins. The inflorescence is a cyme or solitary flower. Flower sepals and petals are often similar, separate and radially symmetric. Flowers may have few to many petals, often with many stamens and carpels, and produce follicle fruit. Examples of genera in the buttercup family are:</p> <ul><li><em>Aquilegia</em> (columbine)</li> <li><em>Clematis</em> (leather flower)</li> <li><em>Delphinium</em> (larkspur)</li> <li><em>Helleborus</em> (hellebore)</li> <li><em>Ranunculus</em> (buttercup)</li> </ul> <h2>Rosaceae – rose family</h2> <p>The rose family, Rosaceae is a large and important family of woody and herbaceous, deciduous and evergreen plants. It is valued for its bush and tree fruits and for many popular horticultural ornamental plants. A few commonly grown rosaceous plants include:</p> <ul><li><em>Cotoneaster</em> (cotoneaster)</li> <li><em>Fragaria</em> (strawberry)</li> <li><em>Malus</em> (crabapple)</li> <li><em>Spiraea</em> (spirea)</li> </ul> <p>Common features of these genera include simple rotate flowers with 5 separate petals, sepals, and stamens, and simple or multiple fleshy or achene fruits. Leave are alternate or basal in arrangement, simple or compound, sometimes toothed and often with stipules. Spines, thorns, and prickles are prevalent in the rose family.</p> <h2>Sapindaceae – soapberry family</h2> <p>The soapberry family, Sapindaceae is a large family of about 140 genera of trees and shrubs, lianas, and vines. Family members such as maples and buckeyes are valued for lumber and ornament. A few examples of sapindaceous plants include:</p> <ul><li><em>Acer</em> (maple)</li> <li><em>Aesculus</em> (buckeye, horse chestnut)</li> <li><em>Koelreuteria</em> (golden rain tree)</li> </ul> <p>Some genera in Sapindaceae, including <em>Acer</em> (maple) are lactiferous, i.e. containing a milky sap. Maples and buckeyes include mostly deciduous trees and shrubs with petiolate, opposite leaves that are often simple, lobed or dissected, or pinnate, ternate, or palmately compound. Leaf venation is palmate or pinnate and leaflet margins may be entire, crenate, serrate, or dentate. The flowers are unisexual or bisexual in racemes, panicles or corymbs. The fruit is typically a distinctive samara in the maples, while the buckeyes produce globular dehiscent capsules with poisonous nuts.</p> <p>There are several hundred plant families and comprehensive information about additional families is available at this link to the <a href="https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/angiosperms/angiosperm-phylogeny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.digitalatlasofancientlife.org/learn/embryophytes/angiosperms/angiosperm-phylogeny/"><em>Digital Atlas of Ancient Life Overview of Angiosperm Phylogeny</em> [New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="66-2"></span></span>.</p> <h2>Review</h2> <p>Identify the family name for each plant genus.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

While early European explorers to North America described the new world as untouched wilderness, generations of Indigenous residents used plants for decoration and ritual and managed growing conditions for food for thousands of years. The relationship between people, plants, and the environment on the Pacific coast of North America is described at this link to the <a href="http://www.goert.ca/about/why_important.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.goert.ca/about/why_important.php"><em>Garry oak ecosystem</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-1"></span></span></p> <p class="import-Normal">The early European plant explorer,&nbsp; Archibald Menzies has been credited as the first discoverer, describer, and collector of a number of plants whose provenance is the Pacific Northwest. Provenance refers to the populations of plants that occur naturally in local regions. For example, <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii (</em>Douglas fir) and <em>Arbutus menziesii (</em>Pacific madrone) both occur naturally in the Pacific Northwest.&nbsp; A plant’s nativity or provenance can be determined either geographically or politically. <em>Acer </em><em>saccharum (</em>sugar maple), is native to central eastern North America, in other words, a Canadian native, but not a Pacific Northwest native. Similarly, <em>Artemisia </em><em>tridentata (</em>big sagebrush) and <em>Rhus</em> <em>glabra (</em>smooth sumac) are native to interior British Columbia, but only to the dry interior valleys, not to the coast.</p> <h2>Native Plants</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Plants that occur naturally in a place are considered native or indigenous to a place. Native plants have undergone genetic adaptations that have allowed them to evolve within the physical, chemical, and biological conditions of local ecosystems. As such, they function as part of a biodiverse community of organisms that includes plants, animals, and microorganisms adapted to local environmental conditions.</p> <p class="import-Normal">In North America, an indigenous designation is usually applied to plants that were present before first contact with Europeans. Thus, <em>Plantago</em> spp. (plantains), although widespread here, are not considered native since they were brought here as a result of immigration by early European settlers. However, the influences of climate change and globalization will likely redefine what it means to be indigenous.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Native gardening with indigenous plants that are appropriate to the conditions and geography of a given area can simulate the biodiversity of a natural habitat. Native plant gardens locally frequently include plants that are not native to the Lower Mainland of British Columbia, but also include plants native to other parts of the Pacific Northwest. For instance, <em>Quercus</em> <em>garryana (</em>Garry oak), also discovered and described by Archibald Menzies, is now grown in gardens in the Lower Mainland, but is only found naturally in rain shadow climates, such as on southern Vancouver Island.</p> <p class="import-Normal"><span class="import-Hyperlink">While not all native plants may be garden worthy for ornamental impact, those chosen from the regional locality of a garden will often blend appropriately and will be among the best adapted to local moisture, soil, and climatic conditions. Although native plants are not immune to pest and disease problems, the majority of locally native plants seem to attract fewer problems than many exotics do. Efforts to restore natural habitats using provenance-specific plants grown from locally sourced seed perform better than non-natives when established in these areas. However, changing climate patterns and the impacts of urbanization will likely have consequences for plant provenance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <h3 class="import-Normal">Natural Habitats</h3> <p>Natural habitats provide the resources that enable indigenous plants to persist and thrive in existing growing conditions.&nbsp; Examples of natural habitats commonly used as horticultural garden themes include alpine, woodland, Mediterranean, and bog. The growth characteristics of plants native to these habitats have been shaped by differences in elevation, temperature range, precipitation, soil types and geology, and biological and chemical factors. Over time, indigenous species successfully adapted to the habitat conditions by developing specialized features for survival. Some features associated with alpine, woodland, Mediterranean, and bog plants are described below. Additional information about how evolution and natural habitats have influenced plant adaptations is available at this link to the <a href="http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/adapt.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/adapt.html"><em>Missouri Botanical Garden</em> [New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-2"></span></span>.</p> <h3>Alpine plants</h3> <p>True alpine plants are well adapted to the harsh environments of high elevations. Above tree line, low temperatures, high sunlight, constant wind, dryness, and a short growing season are typical. Plant adaptations include growth low to the ground, a compact cushion or mat habit, and thick, waxy evergreen or pubescent (hairy), or curly leaves. Alpines, such as <em>Campanula</em> spp. (bell flower) flower in late spring and early summer and may have deep or extensive roots or below ground storage organs to persist in thin, low nutrient mountain soils. Although well adapted for extreme temperatures, alpine plants are typically&nbsp; intolerant of constant wetness around the roots and warm and humid summer conditions. Information about these specialized plants is available at this link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_plant" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_plant"><em>Alpine plant</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-3"></span></span>.</p> <h3>Woodland understory plants</h3> <p>The temperate woodland habitat is characterized by distinct growing seasons, a dormant period, relatively consistent precipitation, and rich soils. Trees dominate this habitat forming an overhead canopy that shades and cools the understory and forest floor to varying degrees. Woodland understory plants include layers of woody shrubs and herbaceous plants that are adapted in size, form, shade tolerance, and slow growth or dormancy when light and water are limited<strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Understory plants such as <em>Hydrangea quercifolia</em> (oakleaf hydrangea) flower in late winter to early summer, before the leaves of deciduous shade trees fully emerge. Depending on the amount of light available, some understory plants have distinctive leaf color and patterns of ornamental interest in gardens. Information on gardening with woodland understory plants is available at this link to <a href="https://wildseedproject.net/2016/03/in-the-shade-gardening-with-native-plants-from-the-woodland-understory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://wildseedproject.net/2016/03/in-the-shade-gardening-with-native-plants-from-the-woodland-understory/"><em>In the Shade: Gardening with Native Plants from the Woodland Understory</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-4"></span></span></p> <h3>Mediterranean plants</h3> <p>Mediterranean plants, such as <em>Cotinus coggygria</em> (smoke bush) and&nbsp; <em>Lavandula</em> spp. (lavender) are adapted to short, mild, and wet winters and long, warm, and dry summers. Some are short, dense, and shrubby evergreens that are suited to well drained soils, drought, and fire. Leaves may be leathery or reduced in size, and aromatic with thick, waxy or hairy coverings to reduce water loss, and bluish-grey (glaucous) or light in color to reflect excessive light. Some examples of naturally occurring vegetation are listed at this link to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate#Natural_vegetation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate#Natural_vegetation"><em>Mediterranean climate Wikipedia</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-5"></span></span></p> <h3>Bog plants</h3> <p>Bogs and freshwater habitats are typically oxygen and nutrient poor with acidic pH conditions. <em>Quercus palustris</em> (pin oak) is an example of a tree that naturally grows in these conditions. Bog plants are adapted to growing in standing water while marginal plants such as <em>Iris</em> <em>siberica</em> (Siberian iris) and <em>Typha</em> spp. (cattail) thrive in waterlogged soils and shallow waters with short term dryness. Some bog and marginal plants such as <em>Juncus effusus</em> ‘Spiralis’ have striking foliage and make good choices for planting areas with limited or poor drainage. The bog habitat is described at this link to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#Habitats" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#Habitats"><em>Bog</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-6"></span></span></p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='69-1'>http://www.goert.ca/about/why_important.php</div><div id='69-2'>http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/adapt.html</div><div id='69-3'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpine_plant</div><div id='69-4'>https://wildseedproject.net/2016/03/in-the-shade-gardening-with-native-plants-from-the-woodland-understory/</div><div id='69-5'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_climate#Natural_vegetation</div><div id='69-6'>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bog#Habitats</div></div></div></div>

Ornamental plants are used for environmental enhancement, food production, and re-vegetation of damaged ecosystems, as well as for their visual and sensory appeal in landscapes and gardens.&nbsp;An overview of the ornmental horticulture sector in Canada is available at this link to the <a href="https://coha-acho.ca/our-sector/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://coha-acho.ca/our-sector/"><em>Canadian Ornamental Horticulture Alliance</em> [New Tab]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="71-1"></span></span>. Some common categories of plant use include bedding plants and cut flowers, trees and shrubs, and ground covers and climbers.</p> <h2>Bedding Plants and Cut Flowers</h2> <p>Bedding plants, such as <em>Lobelia erinus</em> (lobelia) and <em>Petunia</em> ×&nbsp;<em>hybrida</em> (petunia) are grown in greenhouses and nurseries for seasonal interest in gardens and landscapes.&nbsp; They are typically tender and half-hardy annuals, biennials, and some perennials that grow quickly and provide a vibrant display of color in beds, containers, and hanging baskets. Cut flowers produced by the floral industry include both herbaceous and woody flowering plants and cut greens for specialty services.</p> <h2>Trees and Shrubs</h2> <p>Trees such as <em>Acer rubrum</em> (red maple) and <em>Quercus rubra</em> (red oak) grow from single stems while some like <em>Acer circinatum </em>(vine maple) have two or three main stems. This distinguishes trees from shrubs with several or many stems branching from or near soil level. Whether deciduous or evergreen, trees are generally larger than shrubs however, their shape and height can vary from dwarf cultivars 1 meter high, to grafted standards on 2 meter rootstocks and specimens of 90 meters or more. Tree selection must account for mature height and spread to ensure adequate space in the landscape. Trees with year-round interest in form, foliage, flower, fruit, and bark are commonly grown in open sites as specimen plants.&nbsp; They may serve as a focal point for an entrance or as a special accent in the garden. On large sites, trees are often planted in groups to form woodlands or hedging. Strategic planting of trees in urban environments can channel air movement, shade and cool microclimates, and provide barriers for noise and security, as well as frame or screen views.</p> <p>Shrubs such as <em>Cornus alba</em> ‘Elegantissima’ (silverleaf dogwood) and <em>Hibiscus syriacus</em> (hardy hibiscus) are valued for their ornamental features and varied growth forms. Shrub sizes range from 0.15 meter to about 6 meters. Deciduous and broadleaf evergreens, variegated foliage, fragrant and showy flowers and fruits, as well as decorative stems and buds provide year round interest and variety in mixed borders and container planting. Shrubs are commonly massed for effect, planted in small groups in mixed plantings, or used as screens and hedging. The wide selection of shrubs produced by nurseries provides for most garden conditions.</p> <h2>Groundcovers</h2> <p>Groundcover plants such as <em>Ajuga reptans</em> (bugleweed) are adapted with creeping and carpeting habits and are often used under woodland and shrub plantings, and for covering and stabilizing some slopes.&nbsp; Plant runners (stolons) that root where they touch the ground and spreading underground stems (rhizomes) that send up new shoots and form colonies stabilize and cover bare soil reducing erosion, evaporation, and weed growth.</p> <h2>Climbers</h2> <p>Climbing plants, whether woody or herbaceous, deciduous or evergreen provide strong vertical elements and year round garden interest. Where space is limited, climbers such as <em>Hydrangea anomala</em> ssp. <em>petiolaris </em>(climbing hydrangea) may be the best option for screening and climate control. It is important to match the vigor, method of attachment, height, and spread of a climber with an appropriately sturdy support and adequate light exposure for flowering and fruiting.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='71-1'>https://coha-acho.ca/our-sector/</div></div></div></div>

Plant form, the three-dimensional shape or silhouette outline of a plant, is determined by the habit or branching pattern. For example, plants with an excurrent growth habit have single, undivided trunks and lateral branches that typically produce an overall cone or pyramid-shaped form. This plant form and growth habit is characteristic of many gymnosperms such as <em>Thuja plicata </em>(western red cedar) and <em>Pseudotsuga menziesii</em> (Douglas fir). In contrast, decurrent, or sometimes called deliquescent growth habit exhibits several roughly equal branches arising from the trunk or stem that become the main structural system of the plant. This habit results in the typical rounded or spreading form of deciduous trees such as <em>Acer macrophyllum</em> (big leaf maple) or <em>Acer platanoides</em> (Norway maple) as well as many shrubs. Depending on the branching pattern, additional descriptive terms such as upright or horizontal, arching or weeping, open, twiggy or dense may be used for shrubs as well as for trees.</p> <h2>Review</h2> <p>Describe plant form and habit.

A cross section taken through a stem or shoot reveals soft plant tissue, the pith. The color and texture of the pith may be used for distinguishing between similar plant types, such as species of <em>Cornus</em> (dogwood). Pith may be brown or white, variably shaped, and uniformly solid, chambered or hollow as illustrated in Figure 20.1.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_75" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" style="width: 350px"><img class="wp-image-73 size-full" title="Pith types found in plant stems" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2019/12/Pith-types-1-e1581282006164.jpg" alt="Pith types found in plant stems with terms below and beside features: Hollow, Chambered.

In addition to plant identification, plant bark may have highly ornamental value in the landscape. Color change, peeling and exfoliation, and smooth<em>,</em> or furrowed (grooved), ridged or plate-like&nbsp; are some common descriptors used for bark. For example, Figure 20.2 shows the bark of <a href="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/86b35ef4-ee15-4ac5-89ab-85e3d34145dc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://search.creativecommons.org/photos/86b35ef4-ee15-4ac5-89ab-85e3d34145dc"><em>Platanus</em> ×&nbsp;<em>acerifolia</em></a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="76-1"></span></span> In addition to its ornamental value, the bark is a key identification feature for this tree.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" style="width: 225px"><img class="wp-image-74 size-medium" title="&amp;quot;Plane tree, Thurlow Road, Torquay&amp;quot;" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/2586572_e6337b92-225x300.jpg" alt="Bark of Platanus x acerifolia (London plane tree)" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/2586572_e6337b92-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/2586572_e6337b92-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/2586572_e6337b92-350x467.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/2586572_e6337b92.jpg 480w" /><div class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 20.2 Bark of Platanus&nbsp; x acerifolia (London plane tree).</span></div></div> <p>Buds, condensed shoots containing a new leaf, leaf cluster, or flower are located in leaf axils and at tips of stems. In general, a flower bud appears somewhat larger and rounder than a vegetative bud. While bud shape, size, color, and surface texture vary by species, bud arrangement will be alternate, opposite or whorled on the stem. Bud scales, the protective covering of buds may be single, few, or many, and imbricated (overlapping) or not as shown in the Figure 20.3. The shape of a leaf scar, where a leaf falls off a twig, and the arrangement of vascular bundles within the leaf scar may also provide distinct identification characteristics as in <em>Juglans</em> spp. (walnut).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" style="width: 350px"><img class="wp-image-75 size-full" title="Bud types found in woody plants" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Bud-types-found-in-woody-plants-e1581280151202.jpg" alt="Bud types found in woody plants with terms below: Narrowly conical, ovoid, conical, accessory, superposed, one-scaled, stalked, outer scale centred over scar, scales in two ranks, striate scales, rounded, valvate" width="350" height="475" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Bud-types-found-in-woody-plants-e1581280151202.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Bud-types-found-in-woody-plants-e1581280151202-221x300.jpg 221w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Bud-types-found-in-woody-plants-e1581280151202-65x88.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/Bud-types-found-in-woody-plants-e1581280151202-225x305.jpg 225w" /><div class="wp-caption-text"><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 20.3 Bud types found in woody plants.</span></div></div> <p>The dichotomous key below differentiates bud characteristics for some common deciduous trees and shrubs.

Plants in gardens, agricultural, and natural settings that are considered undesirable or out of place due to appearance, contamination, or competition with desirable plants are often classed as weeds. Aquatic and terrestrial weedy species transported or migrated beyond their natural range that become established&nbsp; in a new area may pose significant impact or injury to economic, environmental, or human health. These are categorized as invasive, noxious, or nuisance species by governing authorities. Examples of species monitored for management in British Columbia are listed at this link to <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/invasive-species/plants/terrestrial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/environment/plants-animals-ecosystems/invasive-species/plants/terrestrial"><em>Invasive Terrestrial Plants</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="78-1"></span></span></p> <p>Common characteristics of weedy species include aggressive growth, competition with other plants for light, water, nutrients, and space, an ability to grow in a wide range of soils and adverse conditions, and resistance to control measures. Some cultivated plants such as <em>Lythrum salicaria</em> ( purple loosestrife), <em>Vinca minor</em> (periwinkle) and <em>Lamiastrum galeobdolon</em> (yellow archangel) can overwhelm and displace other plants and ecosystems. A number of unwanted horticultural plants are identified in this link to the <a href="https://www.bcinvasives.ca/documents/Field_Guide_to_Noxious_Weeds_Final_WEB_09-25-2014.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.bcinvasives.ca/documents/Field_Guide_to_Noxious_Weeds_Final_WEB_09-25-2014.pdf"><em>Field Guide to Noxious Weeds and Other Selected Invasive Plants of British Columbia</em> [PDF] [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="78-2"></span></span></p> <p>When environmental conditions in a site change there will always be a change in the plant make up.&nbsp; For instance, where the ground is fully covered with vegetation there will be no bare soil available for weeds to inhabit. Disturbances in vegetation cover and changes in environmental conditions due to natural events or human activities and management practices create opportunities for species with adapted life cycles and growth characteristics to become established, reproduce, and colonize a site<span class="ILfuVd">.</span></p> <p><span class="ILfuVd">Knowledge of family characteristics and life cycles is important for proper landscape and garden plant selection.&nbsp;</span> Species characteristics <span style="font-size: 14pt;">such as generalist pollination requirements, diverse seed and vegetative dispersal methods, the ability to adapt quickly to new environmental conditions may indicate the potential for invasive growth. </span>Combinations of these characteristics are commonly exhibited in the Asteraceae (aster), Brassicaceae (mustard), Polygonaceae (knotweed), Fabaceae (pea), and Euphorbiaceae (spurge) families, as well as others.</p> <p>Weeds are typically classified according to their life cycle. Depending on the degree of disturbance to a site, herbaceous plant species with annual and biennial life cycles will be the first to colonize followed by perennial herbaceous and woody plants. Annual weeds such as <em>Galium aparine</em> (cleavers) that produce high numbers of seed occur most frequently in regularly cultivated and disturbed areas such as vegetable gardens or annual borders. Their rapid growth can smother slower-growing plants and compete for moisture and light. An advantage for winter annuals such as <em>Capsella bursa-pastoris</em> (shepherd’s purse) and <em>Cardamine oligosperma (snapweed) </em>is that they germinate in the fall, overwinter as a rosette of leaves, and flower and produce many seeds in late winter and early spring. Biennial weeds such as <em>Echium vulgare </em>(blueweed) usually produce only a rosette of leaves in the first growing season. Energy stored in the roots over a winter cold period enables the plant to bolt (flower), produce seeds, and then die in the next season.&nbsp; Removal of the rosette before flowering stops the biennial life cycle.</p> <p>Herbaceous perennial weeds such as <em>Cirsium vulgare</em> (Canada thistle), <em>Heracleum mantegazzianum </em>(giant hogweed), and <em>Equisetum arvense</em> (horsetail) and woody species such as <em>Buddleja davidii</em> (butterfly bush) and <em>Rubus armeniacus</em> (Himalayan blackberry) survive adverse conditions by storing food reserves in roots, rhizomes, and tubers or bulbs in some species. Important control measures include early identification and removal before establishment.</p> <p>In situations where weed populations remain below established thresholds of impact or injury for a given site and use, there are ecosystem benefits. For instance weed cover can provide protection from soil erosion, produce pollen, nectar, and habitat for beneficial organisms and wildlife, serve as indicators of soil conditions, and contribute organic matter for soil enhancement, as well as provide food and medicinal products for human use.</p> <h2>Practice</h2> <p>For each plant, access the correct common name and family name available at this link to the <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/search.gsp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/search.gsp" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/search.gsp"><em>KPU Plant Database</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="78-3"></span></span></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Therefore, the ultimate deciding factor in whether a plant will survive in a given location (with adequate supplies of light, moisture, and nutrients) is quite simply the lowest temperature it will have to endure. Although several factors such as length of frost free period, rainfall, snow cover, wind, and soil type affect the hardiness of a plant, in temperate climates the minimum temperature during the winter is the most important element in plant survival.</p> <h2>Plant Hardiness Zones</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Average annual minimum temperatures are determined for locations throughout North America. Plotting areas with similar average minimum temperatures yields a temperature zone map. Zones numbered 0 to 9 relate to the average annual minimum temperature calculated for that zone. The zones are divided into “a” and “b,” the “b” area representing the mildest part of the zone. Plants designated “a” with the zone number are hardy in the colder part of that zone; those designated “b” in only the milder section.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Plant hardiness ratings are determined by testing over several years at agricultural research and testing stations as well as private nurseries and gardens. A plant which is hardy to a particular zone can be expected to survive in all regions on the map which have an average annual minimum temperature equal to or greater than the hardiness zone rating for that plant.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Currently, two hardiness zone maps are widely used in North America:</p> <ul><li>Agriculture Canada</li> <li>United States Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.)</li> </ul> <p>In Canada, horticulturists often refer to the Agriculture Canada hardiness zone map. It is similar to the U.S.D.A. system except that the temperature range for each of the 9 zones is given in degrees Celsius instead of degrees Fahrenheit.

Plant selection and placement that matches a species growth characteristics with existing conditions and available maintenance requirements supports healthy growth and vigor.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Cultural requirements are defined as site conditions that influence plant growth and longevity. Conditions typically include diverse combinations of light exposure, moisture conditions, soil types and nutrient availability, and hardiness zones. Depending on the site, conditions may also include plant tolerance for wind, salt, and drought. While garden plants require some routine maintenance for healthy growth, proper plant selection and planting practices decrease unsustainable maintenance inputs and reduce incidences of pest and disease and plant failure or death.</p> <p>Maintenance requirements are related to factors that influence plant growth and development. Light exposure is typically classified as full (six or more hours of direct sunlight per day), part (four to six hours of sunlight) or part shade (two to fours hours of sunlight), and shade (less than two hours of sunlight per day). Water requirements and existing moisture conditions range from dry or xeric, to well-drained, and poorly drained or wet depending on the amount of rainfall or irrigation, the site slope, and the soil type. Soil drainage will be influenced by the amount and arrangement of particles of sand, silt and clay. Gravel or sandy soils tend to drain rapidly and have low nutrient levels because they are made up of relatively large particles with large pores or spaces between them.&nbsp; In contrast, clay and silt soils are composed of tiny particles separated by minute spaces that tend to retain nutrients and drain more slowly. Garden loam that is fertile and well drained is the result of a balanced combination sand, silt, and clay.</p> <p>Information from resources about plant growth requirements for light, water, soils and nutrients combined with knowledge of prevailing conditions and smaller-scale garden variations in temperature, air quality, wind, and humidity, and environmental stresses or pests and disease supports the identification of the right plant for the right place.</p> <h2>Review</h2> <p>Identify plant requirements for light exposure, soil type, and water use available at this link to the <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/"><em>KPU Plant Database</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="82-1"></span></span></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Exotic plants from the tropics that were cultivated indoors in northern regions became the forerunners&nbsp; of modern-day foliage, flower, fern, climber, and succulent house plants. By the mid 19<sup>th</sup> century, indoor gardening was a popular hobby of the wealthy and the emerging middle class. The impact of the Industrial Revolution on building lighting and heating increased the number of plants that could be grown indoors. Developments in building construction methods and heating and ventilation systems in the early to mid 20<sup>th</sup> century expanded the use of plants to beautify the indoor environments of offices, hospitals, public spaces, and private homes. In response, the horticultural production and hybridization of foliage and flowering plants increased and landscaping companies specialized in interior landscape design, installation, and maintenance services.</p> <p>In addition to providing visual interest and softening the hard edges of structures with foliage texture, studies have shown that plants can improve indoor air quality. For example, during the energy crisis in the late 20<sup>th</sup> century, the construction of air tight buildings and use of synthetic materials were intended to reduce energy costs. However, toxic air pollutants such as trichloroethylene, benzene, and formaldehyde given off from paint, plywood, insulation, plastic, carpet and fabrics became concentrated in the air tight spaces and made inhabitants feel sick. The NASA Clean Air study demonstrated that indoor plants purified air by removing and trapping air pollutants in leaves, roots, and soil.

Research suggests that for people who spend significant time indoors at work, the presence of plants can improve mood, contribute to contentment, and promote motivation and productivity.

Interior landscapes or plantscapes have diversified the use of tropical foliage and flowering plants in atria and large conservatories, indoor and vertical gardens, potted office plants and hanging baskets, as well as color bowls, dish gardens, and terrariums.

They are adapted to climate conditions with an average temperature of 18<sup>ο</sup>C (64.4<sup>ο</sup>F), no chance of frost, and considerable precipitation at least part of the year. Depending on the latitude, plant species may be adapted to tropical humid (rain forest) or tropical dry (savanna) conditions.</p> <p>Rain forest vegetation is lush with tall trees and thick lianas forming a dense canopy that filters sunlight from the smaller trees, vines, palms, orchids, and ferns growing in the understory. Examples of plant adaptations for high humidity and competition for light include large leaves with waxy surfaces and pointed tips that shed water. More information about interesting plant adaptions for this hot, humid climate is available at this link to <a href="http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/troprf.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/troprf.html"><em>The Tropical Rainforest </em>[New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="108-1"></span></span>.</p> <p>Grasses, shrubs and trees of the tropical savanna are well adapted for climate extremes. Long tap roots, thick fire resistant bark, tree trunks that store water, leaf drop during the dry season, and storage organs like bulbs and corms allow plants to survive an extremely hot, long dry season and a very wet season.

Some common indoor plants include <em>Codiaeum variegatum</em>&nbsp; var. <em>pictum </em>(croton),&nbsp; <em>Dieffenbachia</em> <em>seguine </em>(dumb cane), <em>Dypsis lutescens </em>(Areca palm), and <em>Epipremnum aureum</em> (devil’s ivy, golden pothos). The morphology of these plants can be readily recognized as belonging to particular family groups and related genera share identifiable morphology. It is often possible to use vegetative features alone to identify these family groups, relying on reproductive features only when needed. For example, the square stems and opposite leaf arrangement of <em>Solenostemon</em> x <em>hybridus&nbsp;</em>(coleus), an indoor house plant and outdoor bedding plant, can be recognized as a member of the mint family, Lamiaceae. The morphological characteristics used to identify some plant families and genera commonly used in interior landscapes are summarized below. Access to images of the genera is available at this link to the <a href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cke-saved-href="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/" data-url="https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/"><em>KPU Plant Database</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="108-3"></span></span></p> <h2 class="import-Normal">Araceae – arum family</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Members of the arum family are called aroids. There are over 100 genera and 2500 species distributed on every continent, with the majority in North Africa and Mediterranean regions.&nbsp;These moncots are known as much for their magnificent foliage as for their characteristic inflorescence. In natural habitats, they range from shrubs such as <em>Dieffenbachia</em> <em>seguine</em>&nbsp;and climbers such as <em>Epipremnum aureum</em> to enormous herbs with corms or tubers.</p> <p class="import-Normal">The leaves are mostly spirally arranged and often parallel but sometimes net-veined and either simple or compound. The petiole has a membranous, sheathing base. The roots of all species are adventitious (i.e., they can arise anywhere on the stem) and are without root hairs. Climbing and epiphytic aroids have two kinds of roots, ones that are absorbent and grow downwards into the soil, and clasping roots that grow into crevices, away from light.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Individual flowers are tiny, and are borne on specialized inflorescence called a spadix. In the majority of species the spadix is surrounded by a leaf-like bract called a spathe. The spathe is frequently colored and serves as a pollinator attractant. In most cases, aroids are pollinated by flies; the resultant fruits are typically berries. Species grown in interior landscapes will prefer bright, indirect light and moist, well drained fertile soils, and evenly warm temperatures. The ARACEAE family has many familiar shrubs and climbers for indoor containers, including:</p> <ul><li class="import-Normal"><em>Aglaonema</em> (Chinese evergreen)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Anthurium</em> (flamingo flower)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Caladium</em> (elephant ear)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Dieffenbachia</em> (dumb cane)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Epipremnum</em> (devil’s ivy)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Monstera</em> (split-leaf philodendron)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Philodendron</em> (philodendron)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Scindapsus</em> (silver pothos)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Spathiphyllum</em> (peace lily)</li> </ul> <h2>Arecaceae – palm family</h2> <p class="import-Normal">The palms comprise a large family (more than 200 genera and 2650 species) of evergreen trees and rattans (climbers) with primarily tropical and warm temperate distribution (few in Africa). Palms such as <em>Dypsis lutescens</em> are immediately recognizable to most people, having spirally arranged, often very large leaves in terminal rosettes.</p> <p class="import-Normal">The slender, unbranched stem of the coconut palm (of tropical-island-paradise fame) is typical of many palms, but there are other distinctive shapes and sizes of palms. Palms are usually categorized as either feather palms (pinnate leaves) or as fan palms (palmate leaves), and may be stout or slender, solitary or suckering, and from dwarf to full-size.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Flowering is rare in indoor cultivation, except with some smaller species (especially <em>Chamaedorea</em>). Flowers are usually small, yellow, 3-parted and partially embedded in the flower stems. After successful pollination, palms generally produce a rounded, fleshy or fibrous drupe (seldom as large as a coconut nor as succulent as a date). Depending on the species, palms grown in interior landscapes will prefer indirect bright to low light and loose well drained soil with regular fertility. Genera commonly cultivated indoors in atriums and containers include:</p> <ul><li class="import-Normal"><em>Caryota</em> (fishtail palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Chamaedorea</em> (parlour palms)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Chamaerops</em> (european fan palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Chrysalidocarpus</em> (butterfly palm)</li> <li><em>Dypsis lutescens&nbsp;</em>(areca palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Howea</em> (Kentia, sentry palms)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Phoenix</em> (date palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Ravenea</em> (majestic palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Rhapis</em> (lady palm)</li> <li class="import-Normal"><em>Trachycarpus</em> (windmill palm)</li> </ul> <h2>Euphorbiaceae – spurge family</h2> <p class="import-Normal">The spurge family is large with more than 300 genera and 7500 species of annual and perennial flowering herbs, shrubs, trees, and some climbers growing in tropical and temperate climates.&nbsp; Some species are succulent and cactus-like and some are characterized by&nbsp; milky sap that may be poisonous. Genera are commonly used in both indoor and outdoor landscapes for their colorful bracts and unusual forms. Tender species such as <em>Codiaeum variegatum</em> var. <em>pictum,</em> an ornamental shrub with attractive, multicolored foliage, is commonly used in interior landscaping<em>.</em></p> <p>Family members usually have simple or sometimes palmately compound leaves that may be sessile or petiolate, often with stipules, and alternately arranged on the stem. Species are frequently monoecious with a raceme or cyme inflorescence and often a radially symmetrical cyathium that is composed of 5 colorful bracts surrounding&nbsp; the reproductive flower parts. The fruit is usually a capsular schizocarp.&nbsp; Euphorbs grown indoors will prefer bright light and well drained soil with moderate to low moisture and fertility. Some examples of genera used for interior landscaping indoor include:</p> <ul><li><em>Acalypha</em> (chenille plant)</li> <li><em>Codiaeum</em> (croton)</li> <li><em>Euphorbia</em> (spurge)</li> </ul> <div class="footnotes"><div id='108-1'>http://www.mbgnet.net/bioplants/troprf.html</div><div id='108-2'>https://savanna2012.weebly.com/unique-plant-adaptions.html</div><div id='108-3'>https://plantdatabase.kpu.ca/plant/search.gsp</div></div></div></div>

Examples of potted plants used in traditional seasonal displays include <em>Euphorbia pulcherrima</em> (poinsettia), <em>Chrysanthemum morifolium</em> (garden mum), and <em>Lilium longiflorum </em>(Easter lily). Events such as weddings, graduations, and funerals are usually celebrated with cut flowers and greens in arrangements, garlands, and bouquets.

Environmental stress from variable combinations of light and moisture levels, exposure to wind and cold, soil characteristics, site slopes and drainage can create difficult situations for planting. Some plants will be better suited to tolerate environmental stress because of morphological and physiological adaptations developed in their native habitat. For example, <em>Berberis buxifolia</em> (box leaf barberry), <em>Gleditsia triacanthos</em> f. <em>inermis </em>(thornless honey locust), and <em>Ginkgo biloba</em> (maidenhair tree, ginkgo) are able to tolerate a fairly wide range of planting conditions. When planting in difficult situations such as the examples described below, select plants from similar habitats that are naturally adapted to grow under the existing conditions.</p> <h2>Sunny arid conditions</h2> <p>Environmental stress associated with arid (xeric) conditions can severely limit plant growth. Climate characteristics include full light exposure, high summer temperatures, low and unpredictable precipitation, and low humidity with drying winds. Soils with poor structure, minimal organic matter or soil biology and low water holding capacity and nutrient availability are common in arid conditions. Where hardiness is a limiting factor for plant selection, local regional native plants adapted to the existing climate, soils, and moisture regimes are often the most suitable choice.</p> <p>Shallow, extensive root systems allow species such as <em>Rudbeckia fulgida</em> (black-eyed Susan) to survive in drought and poor soil conditions. Plant characteristics such as small, compound, and modified leaves and stems, and light or gray colored leaves with hairy or waxy surfaces reflect sunlight, moderate the temperature at the leaf surface, and reduce water loss. <em>Achillea filipendulina</em>&nbsp; ‘Gold Plate’ (Gold Plate yarrow), <em>Artemisia schmidtiana</em> (silver mound), <em>Festuca ovina glauca</em> (blue fescue), <em>Rosa rugosa</em> (rugosa rose), and <em>Abies concolor</em> (white fir) are some examples of plants with these characteristics.

There are many shrubs, trees, climbers, bulbs, ferns, and ground cover plants that either tolerate or prefer partial to full shade. For example, evergreen species and cultivars of <em>Rhododendron</em> spp. prefer deep to part shade while <em>Rhododendron</em> Northern Lights Group (azalea) prefers full sun to part shade. Characteristics of shade plants such as branched habits, two-ranked leaf arrangement, and broad, thin leaf blades are suited to capture available light. A strategy of some herbaceous plants, such as <em>Crocus</em> cvs. (crocus) is to emerge early, flower, set seed, and die back to resting structures before tree and shrub leaves fill in completely. Some shade tolerant trees, such as <span class="scientific1"><em>Tsuga heterophylla</em> (western hemlock) and <em>Acer saccharum</em> (sugar maple) will germinate and grow as understory species until openings in the canopy allow them to grow to full size.</span></p> <p><span class="scientific1">T</span>here is a wide array of ornamental plants suitable for planting in partial to full shade. Examples of ferns are <span class="scientific1"><em>Athyrium niponicum</em>&nbsp;</span><span class="scientific2">var.</span><span class="scientific1">&nbsp;<em>pictum&nbsp;</em>(Japanese painted fern), and <em>Matteuccia struthiopteris</em> (ostrich fern). Shrubs for shade include <em>Aucuba japonica</em> (Japanese aucuba), <em>Kalmia latifolia</em> (mountain laurel), <em>Kerria japonica</em> (Japanese kerria), and <em>Leucothoe</em> <em>fontanesiana</em> ‘Rainbow’ (Rainbow leucothoe). Shade tolerant ground covers include <em>Pachysandra terminalis</em> (Japanese spurge) and <em>Sarcococca hookeriana</em> &nbsp;var. <em>humilis</em>&nbsp; (dwarf sweet box). The woodland understory tree,<em>&nbsp;Cornus florida</em> (Eastern flowering dogwood, pink flowering dogwood) is adapted to growing in partial shade.

Soils with high sand or aggregate content that drain quickly move available water below the plant root zone, and surface slopes with rapid runoff reduce water infiltration into the soil. Overhead structures that block rainfall, such as building eaves or tree canopies with competing roots below ground can also create dry areas. While few plants will survive in permanently dry areas, drought tolerant native and garden plants can flourish in dry soil once established. Examples include ground covers, <em>Arctostaphylos uva-ursi</em> (bearberry, kinnikinnick) and <em>Thymus serpyllum</em> (mother of thyme), and herbaceous perennials, <em>Arabis caucasica</em> (rock cress) and <em>Echinops bannaticus </em>(globe thistle). A few examples of adapted deciduous shrubs and trees are <em>Chaenomeles japonica</em> (flowering quince), <em>Crataegus laevigata</em> cvs. (English hawthorn), <em>Pyrus calleryana</em> (ornamental pear) and <em>Quercus robur</em> (English oak). A conifer example, <em>Juniperus virginiana</em> (eastern red cedar) is tolerant of dry soil.

Dry shade is typically found under tree canopies where dense fibrous roots close to the surface compete with other plants for water. While plants will not survive extended periods of drought without some watering, there are some such as <em>Berberis</em> spp. that will tolerate dry shade once they are properly established. <em>Alchemilla mollis</em> (lady’s mantle), <em>Epimedium</em> hybrid cvs. (hybrid barrenwort), and <em>Pachysandra terminalis</em> (Japanese spurge) are suitable herbaceous ground covers for planting in dry shade. Learn about some practical approaches to planting in dry shade at this link to <a href="https://www.rhs.org.uk/about-the-rhs/publications/the-garden/2014-issues/december/rhs-problem-solver-on-dry-shade.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.rhs.org.uk/about-the-rhs/publications/the-garden/2014-issues/december/rhs-problem-solver-on-dry-shade.pdf"><em>RHS The Garden Dry Shade</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="112-4"></span></span></p> <h2>Wetlands</h2> <p>Natural wetlands with soil that is permanently or seasonally saturated often have anaerobic (low oxygen) conditions. Wetlands are typically vegetated with hydrophytic plants that are adapted to grow wholly or partially in water. Some hydrophytic species float on the surface of water, while others are completely submerged. Emergent species that root in soil underwater and grow shoots up and out of the water are usually found along the shoreline or margin of a wetland.</p> <p>While the roots of many garden plants would rot when deprived of oxygen, hydrophytic plants are suitable choices for sites with water features as well as low areas with seasonal poor drainage or a high water table. Examples of herbaceous perennials suitable for wetland planting include <em>Acorus gramineus</em> ‘Variegatus’ (variegated sweet flag), and <em>Matteuccia struthiopteris</em> (ostrich fern). <em>Aronia melanocarpa</em> (black chokeberry), and <em>Sambucus nigra</em> (elderberry) are adaptable deciduous shrubs for wet conditions as are the deciduous trees&nbsp; <em>Liquidambar styraciflua</em> (American sweetgum), and <em>Salix</em> x <em>sepulcralis</em> var. <em>chrysocoma</em> (weeping willow). Depending on the available space, the large conifer <em>Metasequoia glyptostroboides</em> (dawn redwood) may be a suitable choice.

Damage to soil structure from tilling or working heavy clay and loam soils when they are too wet or frozen, and crusting of bare soils from the impact of rainfall contribute to compaction. As soil particles become densely packed together pore space is reduced and the movement of air, water, organisms, and plant roots is impeded. Once compacted, poor soil drainage, water logging, low oxygen, and hard surface conditions inhibit plant root growth. Plants symptoms may include poorly formed or rotted roots, stunted growth, discolored leaves, and drought stress.</p> <p>While the addition of compost is a long term solution for compacted garden soils, there are a number of species that are able to tolerate compacted soils reasonably well. For example, <em>Catalpa speciosa</em> (western catalpa) is a tough tree that tolerates poor soils and compaction as well as dry and wet soils. <em>Acer saccharhinum</em> (silver maple), <i>Juglans nigra </i>(black walnut), and <em>Ulmus americana</em> (American elm) tolerate some compaction as do <em>Amelanchier canadensis</em> (serviceberry), <em>Juniperus communis</em> ‘Green Carpet’ (Green Carpet juniper), and <em>Matteuccia struthiopteris</em> (ostrich fern). Read more about adapted species available at this link to <a href="https://extension.umaine.edu/gardening/manual/plants-compacted-soils/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://extension.umaine.edu/gardening/manual/plants-compacted-soils/"><em>Plants for Compacted soils</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="112-6"></span></span></p> <h2>Slopes</h2> <p>Sloped embankments and hillsides can be difficult planting situations. Successful plant growth will be influenced by soil type, the north to south aspect, the amount of rainfall, and the degree of incline and length of the slope. Steeper slopes increase the risk of erosion and soil loss that exposes roots or buries small plants. In addition, the run off of sediment from eroded slopes can adversely affect drainage systems and waterways that connect to fish habitat.</p> <p>Planting slopes with grasses and shrubs is an effective way to protect soil and prevent erosion. Fast-growing, adaptable species with dense fine roots that hold the soil together and take up water help stabilize slopes and keep soil in place. Complete vegetation coverage will reduce the impact of rainfall and the potential for soil disturbance and erosion. Methods such as planting pockets and terraced steps will slow surface run off and facilitate the infiltration of irrigation for plant establishment.</p> <p>Plants for slopes typically include native and ornamental grasses and low, spreading shrubs and ground covers that leave no areas of bare soil exposed to the elements. On hot, dry southern aspects, drought-tolerant shrubs and grasses such as <em>Juniperus sabina</em> ‘Tamariscifolia’ (tamarix juniper), <em>Rosa rugosa</em>&nbsp; (rugosa rose), and <em>Festuca ovina glauca</em> (blue fescue) are suitable options. Cooler, moister northern aspects are better suited for shade-tolerant understory shrubs and ground covers such as <em>Gaultheria shallon</em> (salal), and <em>Pachysandra terminalis</em> (Japanese spurge).

Regardless of the size or type, each organism is dependent on every other, either directly or indirectly through food webs and the natural processes of nutrient cycling and energy flow that sustain ecosystems. Plant biodiversity has an invaluable role in the function of ecosystems and the services that people obtain from them including:</p> <ul><li>provision of clean air, water, food, materials, and medicines,</li> <li>regulation of climate, carbon storage, water and waste treatment, and erosion and disease control,</li> <li>support for pollination, biodiversity and habitat, and</li> <li>cultural benefits for health, education, recreation, relaxation, and spiritual well being.</li> </ul> <p>Read more about the importance of ecosystem services at this link to <a href="http://www.teebweb.org/resources/ecosystem-services/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.teebweb.org/resources/ecosystem-services/"><em>The Economics of Ecosystems &amp; Biodiversity </em>[New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="121-1"></span></span></p> <p>Regardless of whether a plant occurs naturally in a place or has been planted indoors or outdoors for ornament or food value, as a species, it has a native home somewhere in the world. Native plant species originated and co-evolved in communities with other organisms in fourteen identified biomes around the world. Biomes are composed of groups of ecosystems with distinct vegetation types and climate patterns. They are typically named for the dominant vegetation type, such as a forest or grassland. Figure 7.1 shows a map of the distribution of the major biomes around the world.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_120" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-120" style="width: 1024px"><img class="wp-image-120 size-full" title="Figure 7.1 Global biomes" src="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="787" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b-300x231.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b-768x590.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b-65x50.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b-225x173.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/5485516989_19bb1a0c93_b-350x269.jpg 350w" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-120"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 7.1 Map and legend showing locations and types of global biomes.</span></em></div></div> <p>With an understanding of plant biology, hardiness, and interactions with soils and climate, native species from different biomes can be successfully grown in landscapes and gardens around the world. For example, <em>Gunnera manicata</em> (gunnera) from South America and <em>Impatiens walleriana</em> (impatiens) from South Africa that originated in the Tropical, Subtropical Broadleaf Forest biome are often grown as ornamental garden plants. The magnificent specimen tree, <em>Cedrus deodara</em> (Deodar cedar) is native to the Tropical, Subtropical Conifer Forest while hedging plants <em>Thuja occidentalis</em> (white cedar) and <em>Taxus cuspidata</em> ‘Capitata’ (upright yew) originated in the Temperate Conifer Forest biome. Many species of the Temperate Broadleaf Mixed Forest biome are commonly grown in landscapes and gardens. Examples of deciduous specimen trees include <em>Acer tataricum</em> ssp. <em>ginnala</em> (Amur maple, Tatarian maple) and <em>Syringa reticulata</em> ‘Ivory Silk’ (Japanese lilac tree) from Eastern Asia, <em>Cercis canadensis</em> (redbud) and <em>Quercus alba</em> (white oak) from Eastern North America, and the European species <em>Prunus padus</em> var. <em>commutata</em> (European bird cherry), and <em>Sorbus aucuparia</em> (European mountain ash). <em>Viburnum trilobum</em> (highbush cranberry) is an understory shrub from northern North America while the closely related <em>Viburnum opulus</em> (European snowball) is native to Europe and Asia. Some familiar garden plants that originated in the Mediterranean Forest, Woodlands, Scrub biome are <em>Cyclamen persicum</em> (cyclamen), <em>Helictotrichon sempervirens</em> (blue oat grass), <em>Lithodora diffusa</em> ‘Grace Ward’ (blue lithospermum), and <em>Rosmarinus officinalis</em> (rosemary).

For example, a plant community of the Temperate Conifer Forest biome located in the Pacific Northwest region of North America would include conifers such as&nbsp; <em>Pinus contorta</em> var. <em>contorta</em> (shore pine), <em>Pseudostuga menziesii</em> (Douglas Fir), <em>Thuja plicata</em> (western red cedar), and <em>Tsuga heterophylla</em> (western hemlock). Depending on the specific site conditions, deciduous and broadleaf evergreen trees may include <em>Alnus rubra</em> (red alder), <em>Arbutus menziesii</em> (arbutus, madrona), <em>Frangula purshiana</em> (cascara), and <em>Populus trichocarpa</em> (black cottonwood, western balsam-poplar). Associated deciduous shrubs may include <em>Ribes sanguineum</em> (flowering currant, winter currant), <em>Rubus spectabilis</em> (salmonberry), <em>Salix discolor</em> (native pussy willow, pussy willow), and <em>Symphoricarpos albus</em> (snowberry). Some deciduous and evergreen native ferns are <em>Adiantum pedatum</em> (maidenhair fern) and <em>Polystichum munitum</em> (western sword fern). A few examples of the many native herbaceous flowering plants are <em>Asarum caudatum</em> (western wild ginger), <em>Erythronium americanum</em> (trout lily, adder’s tongue), <em>Vancouveria hexandra</em> (inside-out flower), and the semiaquatic <em>Sagittaria latifolia</em> (wapato, arrowhead, duck potato).

Currently, landscape contractors, nurseries, garden centres, and mass-market chain stores are the largest distribution channels of native plants in addition to ornamental and floriculture products. The import and export of species for use in arboriculture, landscape horticulture, floriculture, turf, and food production sectors continues to shape the distribution of species in plant communities and ecosystems. While constructed landscapes and gardens may be considered artificial ecosystems, it is possible to plan and maintain communities of local native species and appropriate ornamental plants that support natural processes and ecosystem services.</p> <h2>Practice</h2> <p>Match the images of plants native to the Pacific Northwest.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

When visual interest is planned for one period such as early summer, borders and containers can have a poor appearance the rest of the year. Optimizing the use of grasses, bulbs, perennials, annuals, biennials, shrubs, climbers, and trees can provide a succession of plant forms, colours, textures, and habits throughout the seasons. In temperate regions, year round interest is maximized by selecting plants with at least two, and even three or four seasons of interest.</p> <p>Conifers and broadleaf evergreens shrubs are often used for year round colour and spatial structure. For example, <em>Taxus cuspidata</em> ‘Capitata’ (upright yew) provides reliable winter colour and a framework that can be enhanced with other shapes, textures, and colours. On the other hand, a planting of broadleaf evergreens such as <em>Skimmia japonica</em> (Japanese skimmia) offers winter colour and structure as well as showy spring flowers and colourful fruit in the autumn. Distinctive plant shapes and the bark of trees such as <em>Cryptomeria japonica</em> (Japanese cedar) and <em>Morus alba</em> ‘Pendula’ or species with persistent fruit like <em>Sorbus aucuparia</em> (European mountain ash) also contribute structure and winter interest.</p> <h2>Practice</h2> <p>Recognize woody plants for winter interest.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

For example, the herbaceous specimen plant <em>Gunnera manicata</em> (gunnera, giant rhubarb) provides a bold shape and texture for at least half to perhaps three quarters of the year. With planning, the eye-catching winter stems and seed heads of grasses and perennial species such as <em>Pennisetum alopecuroides</em> (fountain grass), <em>Pennisetum setaceum</em> ‘Rubrum’ (red fountain grass), and <em>Perovskia atriplicifolia</em> (Russian sage) can serve as distractions from seasonal voids. Layering various heights of ground covers, bulbs, annuals and perennials under and around woody shrubs and trees allows a succession of foliage shapes, sizes, textures, and colours to become prominent as the year progresses. In this way, emphasis is placed on year round interest and not only the seasonal show of flowers. A planting calendar is a useful tool for working out the succession of flowers and colour palettes as well as other planting design features. Figure 8.1 shows an example of a basic planting calendar that allows the planner to visualize the times of the year that are most colourful and interesting and those that could use additional development.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123" style="width: 688px"><img class="wp-image-123 size-full" title="Figure 8.1 Sample planting calendar" src="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar.jpg" alt="Figure 8.1 Sample planting calendar" width="688" height="379" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar.jpg 688w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar-300x165.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar-65x36.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar-225x124.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/Planting-Calendar-350x193.jpg 350w" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-123"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 8.1 Sample planting calendar</span></em></div></div> <p>As the succession of spring bulbs like <em>Anemone blanda</em> (Greek windflower, blue wood) and <em>Hyacinthus</em> cvs. (hyacinth) finish flowering and foliage fades, deciduous shrubs such as <em>Spiraea</em> x <em>vanhouttei</em> (bridal wreath spirea) and an array of herbaceous annuals, biennials and perennials come into flower in early and mid spring. Examples of spring blooming perennials include <em>Aubrieta</em> x <em>cultorum</em> (common rock cress), <em>Brunnera macrophylla</em> (Siberian bugloss), <em>Papaver orientale</em> (oriental poppy), <em>Pulmonaria saccharata</em> (lungwort), and <em>Dicentra spectabilis</em> (bleeding heart). From late spring and early to mid summer, the flowers and foliage of broadleaf evergreen shrubs such as <em>Daphne cneorum</em> (garland daphne) and herbaceous species like <em>Thymus pseudolanuginosus</em> (woolly thyme), <em>Heuchera</em> cvs. (coralbells, alumroot), and <em>Phlox paniculata</em> (common phlox) take prominence. The progression of seasonal foliage and bloom continues in mid to late summer and through autumn with perennials such as <em>Actaea simplex</em> Atropurpurea Group (cimicifuga), <em>Aster</em> spp. (common aster), <em>Astrantia major</em> (masterwort, astrantia), <em>Coreopsis</em> spp. &amp; cvs. ( coreopsis), <em>Geranium</em> spp. &amp; cvs. (geranium), and <em>Gaillardia</em> cvs. (blanket flower).

By comparison, an infrastructure that supplies a community with drinking water is made up of a network of parts that include wells, reservoirs, water mains and smaller pipes. Other familiar examples of infrastructure found in communities are transportation, communications, and electrical networks. These constructed networks are often called grey infrastructure. In nature, networks of rivers, streams, lakes, and oceans make up a natural infrastructure that supports the function of ecosystems and the plants and animals that live there. Where human activities lead to the loss of ecosystems and biodiversity, green infrastructure can be planned and managed to conserve ecosystem services and reduce negative environmental impacts. Green infrastructure is made up of vegetation, soils, and bioengineered technologies that provide communities with a wide range of environmental, social, and economic benefits. When connected in a larger framework of natural and urban forests, habitats, streams and rivers, constructed wetlands and floodplains, as well as parks, residential yards, edible landscapes, community gardens, green roofs, green walls, bioswales, and rain gardens, a green infrastructure network is created.</p> <p>Traditional stormwater infrastructure that collects, drains and discharges water from sites as quickly as possible can increase the potential for flash flooding, pollution, and scouring damage downstream. Sealed surfaces like rooftops, parking lots, and roads accelerate surface water runoff and prevent infiltration into soil for cleansing, groundwater recharge, and plant use. In contrast, green infrastructure for stormwater management mimics natural landscapes that intercept, retain, absorb, filter, and slowly release stormwater by evapotranspiration and controlled runoff. Combinations of green infrastructure components such as green roofs, green walls, bioswales, rain gardens, and permeable paving reduce the quantity and improve the quality of stormwater before its release from a site.

Plants and their processes of photosynthesis, water uptake, and respiration contribute to:</p> <ul><li>oxygen production and carbon sequestration,</li> <li>pollution removal from air, soil, and water,</li> <li>flood control, and groundwater and stormwater management,</li> <li>surface shading and cooling of air temperature by evapotranspiration, and</li> <li>wildlife and pollinator habitat, and green space for human well being.</li> </ul> <p>Plants for green infrastructure projects are often locally available native species, but not always. Both native and non-native plants are used for the ecosystems services a species or plant community provides. Plants suitable for the growing conditions, function, appearance, and maintenance levels associated with green roofs, green walls, bioswales and rain gardens will be selected within the constraints of a particular project.</p> <h2>Plants for green roofs</h2> <p>Green roofs that are partly or completely covered with vegetation and growing media provide many ecosystem services in urban settings. Services include reducing the volume of rainfall runoff through plant uptake, providing wildlife habitat and green space, and reducing the urban heat island effect through shading and plant evapotranspiration. In addition, the insulating properties of vegetation and growing media dampen noise levels, reduce the heating and cooling costs in buildings, and extend the life of roofing materials. Read more about the benefits of green roofs at this link to <a href="https://greenroofs.org/about-green-roofs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://greenroofs.org/about-green-roofs"><em>Green Roofs for Healthy Cities, About Green Roofs</em> [New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="130-2"></span></span></p> <p>Green roofs are categorized as either intensive or extensive depending on the depth of growing media. Intensive green roof systems with growing media depths greater than 150 mm (6”) can support many plant types including ground covers, herbaceous species, shrubs, trees, and climbers. The high structural loading capacity of intensive green roofs also allows for access to amenities like paths, patios, and water features. Like a traditional garden on a roof, intensive plantings have high requirements for maintenance and inputs. In contrast, extensive green roofs with light weight growing media less than 150&nbsp; mm (6″) in depth support plants with shallow roots and low requirements for maintenance and inputs. Extensive green roofs provide habitat for wildlife but their lower structural loading capacity may restrict human access to maintenance visits. Figure 9.1 shows an example of an extensive green roof that provides visual access to green space in an urban setting.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_129" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-129" style="width: 333px"><img class="wp-image-126 size-full" title="Figure 9.1 Example of an extensive green roof" src="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/4069367413_260f116c80.jpg" alt="Figure 9.1 Example of an extensive green roof" width="333" height="500" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/4069367413_260f116c80.jpg 333w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/4069367413_260f116c80-200x300.jpg 200w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/4069367413_260f116c80-65x98.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/06/4069367413_260f116c80-225x338.jpg 225w" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-129"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 9.1 Example of an extensive green roof</span></em></div></div> <p>Almost any plant type can be grown on a green roof however, the shallow depth and low organic content of extensive green roof growing media will be the limiting factor for plant selection. In general, suitable species are determined by examining the microclimate of the green roof and comparing it to a species’ native habitat. Extensive green roof features that influence plant selection will include water availability, wind speeds, soil depths and temperatures, as well as solar exposure and climate. Plant growth characteristics for extensive green roofs include fast establishment, long lived with dense coverage, pest and disease resistance, shallow rooting, self-regeneration from seed and vegetative parts, tolerance for extreme weather and very dry to saturated conditions, and low requirements for maintenance and inputs. Examples of native habitats that match the extreme conditions found on extensive green roofs include:</p> <ul><li>dry grasslands, cliffs and coasts,</li> <li>arid mountain ranges,</li> <li>steppe, heath, and alpine communities,</li> <li>sandy, talus, and cliff communities, and</li> <li>wastelands, gravel and sand pits, rocky outcrops, other hard surfaces.</li> </ul> <p>Plants suitable for extensive green roofs may include succulents, bulbs and corms, annual or biennial self seeders, bunch and stoloniferous grass-like plants, and some wetland and perennial herbs. Succulents, in particular <em>Sedum</em> cvs. (stonecrop) have been extensively used because they are well adapted for growing in the extensive green roof microclimate.

The shading, water management, screening, buffering, and insulating properties of green walls can reduce air temperature, noise levels, and the energy costs for cooling buildings. The three major categories of green walls are green facades, living walls, and retaining living walls. Green facades of cable systems, trellises, arbors, and fences offset from a building face support the growth of vines and lianas or cascading plants that are rooted in ground level or above ground planters.

Factors for consideration include an indoor or outdoor climate, specialized soil requirements and wall orientation, the green wall design and level of maintenance required. Where green walls are not connected to groundwater, irrigation and intensive maintenance are necessary to ensure appropriate appearance and function. In situations where wall height and desiccation by wind and lack of shade limit plant growth, species adapted to cliff-faces, extreme slopes and thin soil habitats offer suitable choices. Depending on the type of green wall, suitable plants may range from annuals to herbaceous and woody perennials. Some examples of suitable species are&nbsp; <em>Heuchera</em> cvs. (coral bells, alumroot), <em>Penstemon</em> cvs. (beard tongue), <em>Cotoneaster apiculatus</em> (cranberry cotoneaster), <em>Fragaria</em> x <em>ananassa</em> (garden strawberry), and <em>Gaultheria procumbens</em> (wintergreen), as well as succulents and tropical species.&nbsp;Depending on the need for seasonal shading on buildings, green facades may include evergreen or deciduous climbers such as <em>Actinidia kolomikta</em> (actinidia) and <em>Campsis radicans</em> (trumpet vine).&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Practice</h2> <p>Recognize plants suitable for green walls.

Bioretention structures such as bioswales and rain gardens are designed to capture, detain, convey, infiltrate, and evaporate water from a planting. Vegetated bioswales are broad shallow straight or meandering channels with porous soil and gently sloped sides and bottom that collect and convey stormwater from one location to another while maximizing soil infiltration and plant uptake. Bioswales are designed to manage short intense periods of rain and flooding followed by dry periods. They reduce the impact of stormwater events and capture the first flush of pollutants from paved and sealed surfaces for remediation by plants and soil microorganisms. Figure 9.3 shows an example of how a vegetated bioswale captures and conveys stormwater runoff from the sealed pavement as well as the turf area.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-129" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-128 size-medium" title="Figure 9.3 Example of a vegetated bioswale" src="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-300x225.jpg" alt="Figure 9.3 Example of a vegetated bioswale" width="300" height="225" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b-350x263.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/plantidentification/wp-content/uploads/sites/318/2020/09/44194145352_910068f22d_b.jpg 1024w" /><div class="wp-caption-text"><em><span style="color: #000000;">Figure 9.3 Example of a vegetated bioswale</span></em></div></div> <p>Rain gardens are shallow infiltration basins located in depressions and low lying areas that capture and temporarily retain water for infiltration and groundwater recharge.

There are many types of urban agriculture including community gardens, boulevard planting, green roofs, vertical farms, urban chickens, bee keeping, aquaculture, and small scale faming for farmers markets. Some other forms of food production are edible landscapes, food forests, urban orchards, gleaning (public land harvest), grow a row donations and backyard sharing, and guerrilla gardening. Figure 10.1 shows an example of products of urban agriculture available for purchase at a farmers market.

For example, community gardens for non-commercial food production that are allowed in some or all land use designations will have guidelines for safety, accessibility, maintenance, and aesthetics. Read about an example of jurisdictional policy and regulations for community gardens available at this link to <a href="https://www.victoria.ca/assets/Departments/Parks~Rec~Culture/Parks/Documents/community-garden-policy.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.victoria.ca/assets/Departments/Parks~Rec~Culture/Parks/Documents/community-garden-policy.pdf"><em>City of Victoria Community Gardens Policy</em>[PDF][New Tab]</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="133-2"></span></span></p> <p>Food production in residential landscapes is commonly associated with vegetable plots in backyards. Annual species grown for produce are usually arranged in agricultural patterns of straight lines in designated areas. Soil is often amended with compost, heavily irrigated, and seasonally tilled over for new planting. In contrast, edible landscapes, sometimes called foodscapes, incorporate plants for food as well as ornamental value within existing and new residential and public landscape designs. In general, plants for edible landscapes are herbaceous and woody perennial species that:</p> <ul><li>are adapted for the climate and naturally resistant to pest and disease,</li> <li>require less intensive or similar levels of maintenance and inputs as the rest of the planting area, and</li> <li>provide multiple benefits such as food, aesthetics, shading, and water management.</li> </ul> <p>Plants selected for preferred foods and the attributes of form, texture, and colour are integrated with other ornamental plants to achieve a desired garden style and aesthetic appearance. For example, the fruit producing tree, <em>Morus alba</em> ‘Pendula’ (weeping mulberry) serves as a specimen plant with distinctive form. Shrubs with berries and vibrant autumn foliage colour like <em>Vaccinium corymbosum</em> (highbush blueberry) may be planted as hedging. Edible spreaders like <em>Fragaria</em> x <em>ananassa</em> (garden strawberry) and <em>Gaultheria procumbens</em> (wintergreen) provide ground cover while vegetables with fine texture foliage like <em>Daucus carota</em> ssp. <em>sativus</em> (carrot) contrast coarse texture plants like <em>Rheum palmatum</em> (rhubarb). Aromatic herbs such as <em>Origanum laevigatum</em> ‘Herrenhausen’ and <em>Rosmarinus officinalis</em> (rosemary) provide structure, scent, and visual interest alongside edible flowers like <em>Impatiens walleriana</em>&nbsp;(impatiens) and <em>Phlox paniculata</em> (summer phlox, border phlox).

Combining plants with different heights and structure, nutrient requirements, and rooting depths creates growing microclimates and reduces plant competition for soil nutrients. Certain companion plants such as members of the Fabaceae (pea) family that fix atmospheric nitrogen in available forms in root nodules can benefit nearby nitrogen feeders like leafy vegetables. Aromatic herbs can be used to repel pests attracted to other species by smell, and the deliberate planting of host plants distract pests from other plants and attract beneficial insects and predators that feed on pests.

As areas of natural ecosystems are converted to residential, agricultural, industrial, and other uses, the loss of habitat negatively impacts native wildlife. However, where fragments or patches of habitat are not too small and are close together, they can be connected by corridors of vegetation that allow native species to access adequate food, water, shelter and protection. Planting regional native plants that mimic the habitat characteristics of the desired wildlife species in landscapes and gardens can provide the particular needs for food, water, shelter and protection.</p> <p>Creating connections between native and ornamental vegetation and water sources in urban forests, parks, gardens, boulevards, and other plantings allows wildlife to move safely among habitat patches in urban areas. For example, evergreen trees like <em>Cryptomeria japonica</em> (Japanese cedar) with branches close to the ground and deciduous trees with open canopies and multiple branches such as <em>Frangula purshiana</em> (cascara), and <em>Prunus padus</em> var. <em>commutata</em> (European bird cherry) offer shelter and protection, as well as nesting sites and food. Interplanting layers of shrubs like <em>Ribes alpinum</em> (alpine currant), <em>Ribes sanguineum</em> (flowering currant, winter currant), and <em>Rubus spectabilis</em> (salmonberry) with herbaceous species like <em>Andropogon gerardii</em> (big bluestem), <em>Asarum caudatum</em> (western wild ginger), and <em>Polystichum munitum</em> (western sword fern) provides a range of wildlife species with food, shelter, and protection.

Selecting ornamental plants for habitat planting includes examining the potential for species to escape, establish, and overtake natural ecosystems. Non-invasive ornamentals and regional native plants are the responsible alternative to invasive plants. For example, an introduced horticultural plant that has become invasive in wetlands is<em>&nbsp;Butomus umbellatus</em> (flowering rush). Alternate choices for this plant include the native species <em>Scirpus microcarpus (s</em>mall-flowered bulrush), <em>Carex</em> spp. (sedges), and&nbsp;<em>Sagittaria latifolia</em> (wapato, arrowhead).&nbsp; Alternate choices for another invasive, <em>Euphorbia esula</em> (green spurge, leafy spurge) include species in the genera <em>Delosperma</em> (ice plant) and <em>Helianthemum </em>(rock rose). Species in the genera <em>Salvia</em> (sage), and <em>Penstemon</em> (beardtongue) provide alternate choices for the invasive species, <em>Echium vulgare</em> (blueweed). Another invasive species, <em>Linaria vulgaris</em> (toadflax) can be replaced with selections from the genera <em>Penstemon</em> (beardtongue), <em>Hemerocallis</em> (daylily), <em>Antirrhinum</em> (snapdragon), and <em>Kniphofia</em> (torch lily).
