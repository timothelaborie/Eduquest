You can find the new edition here: <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeology2ed/">Physical Geology &#8211; 2nd Edition</a></div> <p>This book was born out of a 2014 meeting of earth science educators representing most of the universities and colleges in British Columbia, and nurtured by a widely shared frustration that many students are not thriving in our courses because textbooks have become too expensive for them to buy. But the real inspiration comes from a fascination for the spectacular geology of western Canada and the many decades that I have spent exploring this region along with colleagues, students, family, and friends. My goal has been to provide an accessible and comprehensive guide to the important topics of geology, richly illustrated with examples from western Canada. Although this text is intended to complement a typical first-year course in physical geology, its contents could be applied to numerous other related courses.</p> <p>As a teacher for many years, and as someone who is constantly striving to discover new things, I am well aware of that people learn in myriad ways, and that for most, simply reading the contents of a book is not one of the most effective ones. For that reason, this book includes numerous embedded exercises and activities that are designed to encourage readers to engage with the concepts presented, and to make meaning of the material under consideration. It is strongly recommended that you try the exercises as you progress through each chapter. You should also find it useful, whether or not assigned by your instructor, to complete the questions at the end of each chapter.</p> <p>Over many years of teaching earth science I have received a lot of feedback from students. What gives me the most pleasure is to hear that someone, having completed my course, now sees Earth with new eyes, and has discovered both the thrill and the value of an enhanced understanding of how our planet works. I sincerely hope that this textbook will help you see Earth in a new way.</p> <p>Steven Earle, Gabriola Island, 2015</p> </div></div>

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-1-1-what-is-geology" title="1.1 What Is Geology? "><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">1</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">1.1 What Is Geology? </h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>In its broadest sense, geology is the study of Earth — its interior and its exterior surface, the rocks and other materials that are around us, the processes that have resulted in the formation of those materials, the water that flows over the surface and lies underground, the changes that have taken place over the vastness of geological time, and the changes that we can anticipate will take place in the near future. Geology is a science, meaning that we use deductive reasoning and scientific methods (see Box 1.1) to understand geological problems. It is, arguably, the most integrated of all of the sciences because it involves the understanding and application of all of the other sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and others. But unlike most of the other sciences, geology has an extra dimension, that of time — deep time — billions of years of it. Geologists study the evidence that they see around them, but in most cases, they are observing the results of processes that happened thousands, millions, and even billions of years in the past. Those were processes that took place at incredibly slow rates — millimetres per year to centimetres per year — but because of the amount of time available, they produced massive results.</p> <p>Geology is displayed on a grand scale in mountainous regions, perhaps nowhere better than the Rocky Mountains in Canada (Figure 1.1). The peak on the right is Rearguard Mountain, which is a few kilometres northeast of Mount Robson, the tallest peak in the Canadian Rockies (3,954 m). The large glacier in the middle of the photo is the Robson Glacier. The river flowing from Robson Glacier drains into Berg Lake in the bottom right. There are many geological features portrayed here. The sedimentary rock that these mountains are made of formed in ocean water over 500 million years ago. A few hundred million years later, these beds were pushed east for tens to hundreds of kilometres by tectonic plate convergence and also pushed up to thousands of metres above sea level. Over the past two million years this area — like most of the rest of Canada — has been repeatedly glaciated, and the erosional effects of those glaciations are obvious. The Robson Glacier is now only a small remnant of its size during the Little Ice Age of the 15th to 18th centuries, as shown by the distinctive line on the slope on the left. Like almost all other glaciers in the world, it is now receding even more rapidly because of human-caused climate change.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1136" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Rearguard-Mt.-and-Robson-Glacier.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1136" alt="Photograph of Rearguard Mt. and Robson Glacier in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Rearguard-Mt.-and-Robson-Glacier.jpg" height="280" width="300" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1136">Figure 1.1  Rearguard Mountain and Robson Glacier in the Rocky Mountains of British Columbia [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Geology is also about understanding the evolution of life on Earth; about discovering resources such as metals and energy; about recognizing and minimizing the environmental implications of our use of those resources; and about learning how to mitigate the hazards related to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and slope failures. All of these aspects of geology, and many more, are covered in this textbook.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><strong>Box 1.1 What are scientific methods?</strong><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg"><br /> </a><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1137" alt="What are scientific methods" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/What-are-scientific-methods.jpg" height="253" width="300" /></a> <p>There is no single method of inquiry that is specifically the “scientific method”; furthermore, scientific inquiry is not necessarily different from serious research in other disciplines. The key feature of serious inquiry is the creation of a hypothesis (a tentative explanation) that could explain the observations that have been made, and then the formulation and testing (by experimentation) of one or more predictions that follow from that hypothesis. For example, we might observe that most of the cobbles in a stream bed are well rounded (see photo in this box), and then derive the hypothesis that the rocks become rounded during transportation along the stream bed. A prediction that follows from this hypothesis is that cobbles present in a stream will become increasingly rounded over time as they are transported downstream. An experiment to test this prediction would be to place some angular cobbles in a stream, label them so that we can be sure to find them again later, and then return at various time intervals (over a period of months or years) to carefully measure their locations and roundness. A critical feature of a good hypothesis and any resulting predictions is that they must be testable.  For example, an alternative hypothesis to the one above is that an extraterrestrial organization creates rounded cobbles and places them in streams when nobody is looking. This may indeed be the case, but there is no practical way to test this hypothesis. Most importantly, there is no way to prove that it is false, because if we aren’t able to catch the aliens at work, we still won’t know if they did it!</p></div> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-1-2-why-study-earth" title="1.2 Why Study Earth?"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">2</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">1.2 Why Study Earth?</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The simple answer to this question is that Earth is our home — our only home for the foreseeable future — and in order to ensure that it continues to be a great place to live, we need to understand how it works. Another answer is that some of us can’t help but study it because it’s fascinating. But there is more to it than that:</p> <ul><li>We rely on Earth for valuable resources such as soil, water, metals, industrial minerals, and energy, and we need to know how to find these resources and exploit them sustainably.</li> <li>We can study rocks and the fossils they contain to understand the evolution of our environment and the life within it.</li> <li>We can learn to minimize our risks from earthquakes, volcanoes, slope failures, and damaging storms.</li> <li>We can learn how and why Earth’s climate has changed in the past, and use that knowledge to understand both natural and human-caused climate change.</li> <li>We can recognize how our activities have altered the environment in many ways and the climate in increasingly serious ways, and how to avoid more severe changes in the future.</li> <li>We can use our knowledge of Earth to understand other planets in our solar system, as well as those around distant stars.</li> </ul> <p>An example of the importance of geological studies for minimizing risks to the public is illustrated in Figure 1.2. This is a slope failure that took place in January 2005 in the Riverside Drive area of North Vancouver. The steep bank beneath the house shown gave way, and a slurry of mud and sand flowed down, destroying another house below and killing one person. This event took place following a heavy rainfall, which is a common occurrence in southwestern B.C. in the winter.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1138" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/deadly-debris-flow-in-the-Riverside-Drive.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1138" alt="Photograph of  the aftermath of a deadly debris flow in the Riverside Drive area of North Vancouver in January, 2005 [The Province, used with permission]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/deadly-debris-flow-in-the-Riverside-Drive.jpg" height="245" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1138">Figure 1.2  The aftermath of a deadly debris flow in the Riverside Drive area of North Vancouver in January, 2005 [The Province, used with permission]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The irony of the 2005 slope failure is that the District of North Vancouver had been warned in a geological report written in 1980 that this area was prone to slope failure and that steps should be taken to minimize the risk to residents. Very little was done in the intervening 25 years, and the results were deadly.</p> </div></div>

In Canada, many geologists work in the resource industries, including mineral exploration and mining and energy exploration and extraction. Other major areas where geologists work include hazard assessment and mitigation (e.g., assessment of risks from slope failures, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions); water supply planning, development, and management; waste management; and assessment of geological issues on construction projects such as highways, tunnels, and bridges. Most geologists are employed in the private sector, but many work for government-funded geological organizations, such as the Geological Survey of Canada or one of the provincial geological surveys. And of course, many geologists are involved in education at the secondary and the postsecondary levels.</p> <p>Some people are attracted to geology because they like to be outdoors, and it is true that many geological opportunities involve fieldwork in places that are as amazing to see as they are interesting to study. But a lot of geological work is also done in offices or laboratories. Geological work tends to be varied and challenging, and for these reasons and many others, geologists are among those who are the most satisfied with their employment.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1139" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1139" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Geologists-examining-ash-layer.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1139" alt="Geologists examining ash-layer" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Geologists-examining-ash-layer-1024x585.jpg" height="229" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1139">Figure 1.3 Geologists examining ash-layer deposits at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii [SE photo]</div></div> <p>In Canada, most working geologists are required to be registered with an association of professional geoscientists.

This is followed by a review of Earth’s internal structure and the processes of plate tectonics, and an explanation of geological time.</p> <p>Like everything else in the universe, Earth is made up of varying proportions of the 90 naturally occurring elements — hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, magnesium, silicon, iron, and so on. In most geological materials, these combine in various ways to make minerals. Minerals will be covered in some detail in Chapter 2, but here we will briefly touch on what minerals are, and how they are related to rocks.</p> <p>A mineral is a naturally occurring combination of specific elements that are arranged in a particular repeating three-dimensional structure or <strong>lattice.</strong><span class="footnote">Terms in <strong>bold</strong> are defined in the glossary at the end of the book.</span> The mineral <strong>halite</strong> is shown as an example in Figure 1.4. In this case, atoms of sodium (Na: purple) alternate with atoms of chlorine (Cl: green) in all three dimensions, and the angles between the bonds are all 90°. Even in a tiny crystal, like the ones in your salt shaker, the lattices extend in all three directions for thousands of repetitions. Halite always has this composition and this structure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1140" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1140" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite.png"><img class="wp-image-1140" alt="Figure 1.4 The lattice structure and composition of the mineral halite (common table salt) [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/lattice-structure-and-composition-of-the-mineral-halite-1024x865.png" height="338" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1140">Figure 1.4 The lattice structure and composition of the mineral halite (common table salt) [SE]</div></div> <div class="textbox shaded"><strong>Note</strong>: Element symbols (e.g., Na and Cl) are used extensively in this book.

Please use those resources if you are not familiar with the element symbols.</div> <p>There are thousands of minerals, although only a few dozen are mentioned in this book. In nature, minerals are found in rocks, and the vast majority of rocks are composed of at least a few different minerals. A close-up view of <strong>granite,</strong> a common rock, is shown in Figure 1.5. Although a hand-sized piece of granite may have thousands of individual mineral crystals in it, there are typically only a few different minerals, as shown here.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1141" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1141" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/close-up-view-of-the-rock-granite.png"><img class="wp-image-1141" alt="Figure 1.5 A close-up view of the rock granite and some of the minerals that it typically contains (H = hornblende (amphibole), Q = quartz and F = feldspar).

Igneous rocks form from <strong>magma</strong> (molten rock) that has either cooled slowly underground (e.g., to produce granite) or cooled quickly at the surface after a volcanic eruption (e.g., <strong>basalt</strong>). Sedimentary rocks, such as <strong>sandstone</strong>, form when the weathered products of other rocks accumulate at the surface and are then buried by other sediments. Metamorphic rocks form when either igneous or sedimentary rocks are heated and squeezed to the point where some of their minerals are unstable and new minerals form to create a different type of rock. An example is <strong>schist</strong>.</p> <p>A key point to remember is the difference between a mineral and a rock. A mineral is a pure substance with a specific composition and structure, while a rock is typically a mixture of several different minerals (although a few types of rock may include only one type of mineral).  Examples of minerals are feldspar, quartz, mica, halite, calcite, and amphibole. Examples of rocks are granite, basalt, sandstone, limestone, and schist.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 1.1 Find a Piece of Granite</strong></p> <p>Granite is very common in most parts of Canada, and unless everything is currently covered with snow where you live, you should have no trouble finding a sample of it near you. The best places to look are pebbly ocean or lake beaches, a gravel bar of a creek or river, a gravel driveway, or somewhere where rounded gravel has been used in landscaping. In the photo shown here, taken on a beach, the granitic pebbles are the ones that are predominantly light coloured with dark specks.</p> <p>Select a sample of granite and, referring to Figure 1.5, see if you can identify some of the minerals in it. It may help to break it in half with a hammer to see a fresh surface, but be careful to protect your eyes if you do so. You should be able to see glassy-looking quartz, dull white plagioclase feldspar (and maybe pink potassium feldspar), and black hornblende or, in some cases, flaky black biotite mica (or both).</p> <p>In addition to identifying the minerals in your granite, you might also try to describe the texture in terms of the range sizes of the mineral crystals (in millimetres) and the shapes of the crystals (some may be rectangular in outline, most will be irregular). Think about where your granite might have come from and how it got to where you found it.</p> </div> </div></div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-1-5-fundamentals-of-plate-tectonics" title="1.5 Fundamentals of Plate Tectonics"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">5</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">1.5 Fundamentals of Plate Tectonics</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p><strong>Plate tectonics</strong> is the model or theory that has been used for the past 60 years to understand Earth’s development and structure — more specifically the origins of continents and oceans, of folded rocks and mountain ranges, of earthquakes and volcanoes, and of continental drift. It is explained in some detail in Chapter 10, but is introduced here because it includes concepts that are important to many of the topics covered in the next few chapters.</p> <p>Key to understanding plate tectonics is an understanding of Earth’s internal structure, which is illustrated in Figure 1.6. Earth’s <strong>core</strong> consists mostly of iron. The outer core is hot enough for the iron to be liquid. The inner core, although even hotter, is under so much pressure that it is solid. The <strong>mantle</strong> is made up of iron and magnesium <strong>silicate </strong>minerals. The bulk of the mantle, surrounding the outer core, is solid rock, but is plastic enough to be able to flow slowly. Surrounding that part of the mantle is a partially molten layer (the <strong>asthenosphere</strong>), and the outermost part of the mantle is rigid. The <strong>crust</strong> — composed mostly of granite on the continents and mostly of basalt beneath the oceans — is also rigid. The crust and outermost rigid mantle together make up the <strong>lithosphere</strong>. The lithosphere is divided into about 20 <strong>tectonic plates</strong> that move in different directions on Earth’s surface. (For a more accurate depiction of the components of the Earth’s interior, please see <a href="#attachment_960">Figure 9.2</a>.)</p> <p>An important property of Earth (and other planets) is that the temperature increases with depth, from close to 0°C at the surface to about 7000°C at the centre of the core. In the crust, the rate of temperature increase is about 30°C/km. This is known as the <strong>geothermal gradient</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1143" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/structure-of-the-Earth’s-interior.png"><img class="wp-image-1143 size-full" alt="The structure of the Earth’s interior showing the inner and outer core, the different layers of the mantle, and the crust [Wikipedia]" src="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/structure-of-the-Earth’s-interior-e1443212967452.png" width="400" height="225" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1143">Figure 1.6&nbsp; The structure of Earth’s interior showing the inner and outer core, the different layers of the mantle, and the crust [Wikipedia]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Heat is continuously flowing outward from Earth’s interior, and the transfer of heat from the core to the mantle causes convection in the mantle (Figure 1.7). This convection is the primary driving force for the movement of tectonic plates. At places where convection currents in the mantle are moving upward, new lithosphere forms (at ocean ridges), and the plates move apart (diverge). Where two plates are converging (and the convective flow is downward), one plate will be <strong>subducted</strong> (pushed down) into the mantle beneath the other. Many of Earth’s major earthquakes and volcanoes are associated with convergent boundaries.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1144" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1144" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle.png"><img class="wp-image-1144" alt="A model of convection within the Earth’s mantle [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Oceanic_spreading.svg/1280px-Oceanic_spreading.svg.png]" src="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-1024x680.png" width="400" height="266" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-1024x680.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-300x199.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-65x43.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-225x149.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle-350x232.png 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/convection-within-the-Earth’s-mantle.png 1245w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1144">Figure 1.7&nbsp; A model of convection within Earth’s mantle [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/Oceanic_spreading.svg/1280px-Oceanic_spreading.svg.png]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Earth’s major tectonic plates and the directions and rates at which they are diverging at sea-floor ridges, are shown in Figure 1.8.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 1.2 Plate Motion During Your Lifetime</strong></p> <p>Using either a map of the tectonic plates from the Internet or Figure 1.8, determine which tectonic plate you are on right now, approximately how fast it is moving, and in what direction.

Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.</span> Of course he wasn’t exactly correct, there was a beginning and there will be an end to Earth, but what he was trying to express is that geological time is so vast that we humans, who typically live for less than a century, have no means of appreciating how much geological time there is. Hutton didn’t even try to assign an age to Earth, but we now know that it is approximately 4,570 million years old. Using the scientific notation for geological time, that is 4,570 <strong>Ma</strong> (for <em>mega annum</em> or “millions of years”) or 4.57 <strong>Ga</strong> (for <em>giga</em> <em>annum</em> or billions of years). More recent dates can be expressed in <strong>ka</strong> (<em>kilo</em> <em>annum</em>); for example, the last cycle of glaciation ended at approximately 11.7 ka or 11,700 years ago. This notation will be used for geological dates throughout this book.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><strong>Exercise 1.3 Using Geological Time Notation </strong>To help you understand the scientific notation for geological time, write the following out in numbers (for example, 3.23 Ma = 3,230,000 years). <table style="width: 428px;"><tbody><tr><td style="width: 428px;"><strong>2.75 ka</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 428px;"><strong>0.93 Ga</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 428px;"><strong>14.2 Ma</strong></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We use this notation to describe times from the present, but not to express time differences in the past. For example, we could say that the dinosaurs lived from about 225 Ma to 65 Ma, which is 160 million years, but we would not say that they lived for 160 Ma.</p> </div> </div> <p>Unfortunately, knowing how to express geological time doesn’t really help us understand or appreciate its extent. A version of the geological time scale is included as Figure 1.9. Unlike time scales you’ll see in other places, or even later in this book, this time scale is linear throughout its length, meaning that 50 Ma during the <strong>Cenozoic</strong> is the same thickness as 50 Ma during the <strong>Hadean</strong>—in each case about the height of the “M” in Ma. The Pleistocene glacial epoch began at about 2.6 Ma, which is equivalent to half the thickness of the thin grey line at the top of the yellow bar marked “Cenozoic.” Most other time scales have earlier parts of Earth’s history compressed so that more detail can be shown for the more recent parts. That makes it difficult to appreciate the extent of geological time.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1153" style="width: 166px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-geological-time-scale.png"><img class="wp-image-1153 size-full" alt="The geological time scale" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/The-geological-time-scale.png" height="535" width="166" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1153">Figure 1.9 The geological time scale [SE]</div></div> <p>To create some context, the <strong>Phanerozoic</strong> Eon (the last 542 million years) is named for the time during which visible (<em>phaneros</em>) life (<em>zoi</em>) is present in the geological record. In fact, large organisms — those that leave fossils visible to the naked eye — have existed for a little longer than that, first appearing around 600 Ma, or a span of just over 13% of geological time. Animals have been on land for 360 million years, or 8% of geological time. Mammals have dominated since the demise of the dinosaurs around 65 Ma, or 1.5% of geological time, and the genus <em>Homo</em> has existed since approximately 2.2 Ma, or 0.05% (1/2,000th) of geological time.</p> <p>Geologists (and geology students) need to understand geological time. That doesn’t mean simply memorizing the geological time scale; instead, it means getting your mind around the concept that although most geological processes are extremely slow, very large and important things can happen if such processes continue for enough time.</p> <p>For example, the Atlantic Ocean between Nova Scotia and northwestern Africa has been getting wider at a rate of about 2.5 cm per year. Imagine yourself taking a journey at that rate — it would be impossibly and ridiculously slow. And yet, since it started to form around 200 Ma (just 4% of geological time), the Atlantic Ocean has grown to a width of over 5,000 km!</p> <p>A useful mechanism for understanding geological time is to scale it all down into one year. The origin of the solar system and Earth at 4.57 Ga would be represented by January 1, and the present year would be represented by the last tiny fraction of a second on New Year’s Eve. At this scale, each day of the year represents 12.5 million years; each hour represents about 500,000 years; each minute represents 8,694 years; and each second represents 145 years.

Minerals can be found in a wide variety of consumer products including paper, medicine, processed foods, cosmetics, and many more. And of course, everything made of metal is also derived from minerals.</p> <p>As defined in Chapter 1, a mineral is <em>a naturally occurring combination of specific elements arranged in a particular repeating three-dimensional structure</em> (Figure 2.1).</p> <p>“Naturally occurring” implies that minerals are not artificially made, although many naturally occurring minerals (e.g., diamond) are also made in laboratories. That doesn’t disqualify them from being minerals.</p> <p>“Specific elements” means that most minerals have a specific chemical formula or composition. The mineral pyrite, for example, is FeS<sub>2</sub> (two atoms of sulphur for each atom of iron), and any significant departure from that would make it a different mineral. But many minerals have variable compositions within a specific range. The mineral olivine, for example, can range all the way from Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> to Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. Intervening compositions are written as (Fe,Mg)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> meaning that Fe and Mg can be present in any proportion. This type of substitution is known as <strong>solid solution</strong>.</p> <p>Most important of all, a mineral has a specific “repeating three-dimensional structure” or “lattice,” which is the way in which the atoms are arranged. We’ve already seen in Chapter 1 how sodium and chlorine atoms in halite alternate in a regular pattern. That happens to be about the simplest mineral lattice of all; most mineral lattices are much more complicated, as we’ll see.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_20" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Crystals-of-native-sulphur.png"><img class="wp-image-20" alt="Crystals of native sulphur" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Crystals-of-native-sulphur.png" width="400" height="220" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-20">Figure 2.1 Crystals of native sulphur at an outlet of volcanic gases, Kilauea volcano, Hawaii</div></div></div>

As summarized in Table 2.1, protons are positively charged, neutrons are uncharged and electrons are negatively charged. The negative charge of one electron balances the positive charge of one proton.

The proton forms the nucleus, while the electron orbits around it. All other elements have neutrons as well as protons in their nucleus, such as helium, which is depicted in Figure 2.2. The positively charged protons tend to repel each other, and the neutrons help to hold the nucleus together. The number of protons is the <strong>atomic number</strong>, and the number of protons plus neutrons is the <strong>atomic mass</strong>. For hydrogen, the atomic mass is 1 because there is one proton and no neutrons. For helium, it is 4: two protons and two neutrons.</p> <p>For most of the 16 lightest elements (up to oxygen) the number of neutrons is equal to the number of protons. For most of the remaining elements, there are more neutrons than protons, because extra neutrons are needed to keep the nucleus together by overcoming the mutual repulsion of the increasing numbers of protons concentrated in a very small space. For example, silicon has 14 protons and 14 neutrons. Its atomic number is 14 and its atomic mass is 28. The most common isotope of uranium has 92 protons and 146 neutrons. Its atomic number is 92 and its atomic mass is 238 (92 + 146).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_24" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/helium-atom.png"><img class="wp-image-24 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/helium-atom-300x293.png" alt="helium atom" width="300" height="293" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-24">Figure 2.2 A depiction of a helium atom.</div></div> <p>The dot in the middle is the nucleus, and the surrounding cloud represents where the two electrons might be at any time.

In other words, a helium atom’s electron cloud is about 100,000 times bigger than its nucleus.</p> <p>Electrons orbiting around the nucleus of an atom are arranged in shells — also known as “energy levels.” The first shell can hold only two electrons, while the next shell holds up to eight electrons. Subsequent shells can hold more electrons, but the outermost shell of any atom holds no more than eight electrons. The electrons in the outermost shell play an important role in bonding between atoms. Elements that have a full outer shell are <strong>inert</strong> in that they do not react with other elements to form compounds. They all appear in the far-right column of the periodic table: helium, neon, argon, etc. For elements that do not have a full outer shell, the outermost electrons can interact with the outermost electrons of nearby atoms to create chemical bonds.

This is accomplished by transferring or sharing electrons with other atoms. Elements that already have their outer orbits filled are considered to be inert; they do not readily take part in chemical reactions.</p> <p>Sodium has 11 electrons: two in the first shell, eight in the second, and one in the third (Figure 2.3). Sodium readily gives up the third shell electron; when it loses this one negative charge, it becomes positively charged. By giving up its lone third shell electron, sodium ends up with a full outer second shell. Chlorine, on the other hand, has 17 electrons: two in the first shell, eight in the second, and seven in the third. Chlorine readily accepts an eighth electron to fill its third shell, and therefore becomes negatively charged because of an imbalance between the number of protons (17) and electrons (18). In changing their number of electrons, these atoms become <strong>ions</strong> — the sodium loses an electron to become a positive ion or <strong>cation</strong>, and the chlorine gains an electron to become a negative ion or <strong>anion</strong> (Figure 2.3). Since negative and positive charges attract, sodium and chlorine ions stick together, creating an <strong>ionic bond</strong>. Electrons can be thought of as being transferred from one atom to another in an ionic bond. Common table salt (NaCl) is a mineral composed of chlorine and sodium linked together by ionic bonds (Figure 1.4). The mineral name for NaCl is halite.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_30" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/NaCl.png"><img class="wp-image-30" alt="&quot;&quot;" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/NaCl.png" width="300" height="316" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-30">Figure 2.3 A very simplified electron configuration of sodium and chlorine atoms (top).

For example, two chlorine atoms, which each seek an eighth electron in their outer shell, can share an electron in what is known as a <strong>covalent bond</strong>, to form chlorine gas (Cl<sub>2</sub>) (Figure 2.4). Electrons are <em>shared</em> in a covalent bond.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_31" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-31" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/two-chlorine-atoms.png"><img class="wp-image-31" alt="two chlorine atoms each share an electron to form a full outer shell." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/two-chlorine-atoms.png" width="300" height="162" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-31">Figure 2.4 Depiction of a covalent bond between two chlorine atoms.

Carbon would need to gain or lose four electrons to have a filled outer shell, and this would create too great a charge imbalance for the ion to be stable. On the other hand, carbon can share electrons to create covalent bonds. In the mineral diamond, the carbon atoms are linked together in a three-dimensional framework, where one carbon atom is bonded to four other carbon atoms and every bond is a very strong covalent bond. In the mineral graphite, the carbon atoms are linked together in sheets or layers (Figure 2.5), and each carbon atom is covalently bonded to three others. Graphite-based compounds, which are strong because of the strong intra-layer covalent bonding, are used in high-end sports equipment such as ultralight racing bicycles. Graphite itself is soft because the bonding between these layers is relatively weak, and it is used in a variety of applications, including lubricants and pencils.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_38" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/carbon.png"><img class="wp-image-38" alt="&quot;&quot;" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/carbon.png" width="400" height="231" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-38">Figure 2.5 The electron configuration of carbon (above) and the sharing of electrons in covalent C bonding of diamond (right).

This structure is the building block of the many important silicate minerals. The bonds in a silica tetrahedron have some of the properties of covalent bonds and some of the properties of ionic bonds. As a result of the ionic character, silicon becomes a cation (with a charge of +4) and oxygen becomes an anion (with a charge of –2). The net charge of a silica tetrahedron (SiO<sub>4</sub>) is –4. As we will see later, silica tetrahedral (plural of <em>tetrahedron</em>) link together in a variety of ways to form most of the common minerals of the crust.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_40" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/silica-tetrahedron.png"><img class="wp-image-40" alt="&quot;&quot;" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/silica-tetrahedron.png" width="400" height="176" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-40">Figure 2.6 The silica tetrahedron, the building block of all silicate minerals (Because the silicon has a charge of +4 and the four oxygens each have a charge of -2, the silica tetrahedron has a net charge of -4.)</div></div> <p>Most minerals are characterized by ionic bonds, covalent bonds, or a combination of the two, but there are other types of bonds that are important in minerals, including metallic bonds and weaker electrostatic forces (hydrogen or Van der Waals bonds). Metallic elements have outer electrons that are relatively loosely held. (The metals are highlighted on the periodic table in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/back-matter/appendix-1-list-of-geologically-important-elements-and-the-periodic-table/">Appendix 1</a>.) When bonds between such atoms are formed, these electrons can move freely from one atom to another. A metal can thus be thought of as an array of positively charged atomic nuclei immersed in a sea of mobile electrons. This feature accounts for two very important properties of metals: their electrical conductivity and their malleability (they can be deformed and shaped).</p> <p>Molecules that are bonded ionically or covalently can also have other weaker electrostatic forces holding them together. Examples of this are the force holding graphite sheets together and the attraction between water molecules.</p> <h2>What’s with all of these “sili” names?</h2> <p>The element <strong>silicon</strong> is one of the most important geological elements and is the second-most abundant element in Earth’s crust (after oxygen). <em>Silicon</em> bonds readily with oxygen to form a <strong>silica</strong> tetrahedron (Figure 2.6). Pure <em>silicon</em> crystals (created in a lab) are used to make semiconductive media in electronic devices. A <strong>silicate</strong> mineral is one in which silicon and oxygen are present as <em>silica</em> tetrahedra. <em>Silica</em> also refers to a chemical component of a rock and is expressed as % SiO<sub>2</sub>. The mineral quartz is made up entirely of <em>silica</em> tetrahedra, and some forms of quartz are known as <em>silica</em>. <strong>Silicone</strong> is a synthetic product (e.g., <em>silicone</em> rubber, resin, or caulking) made from <em>silicon</em>-oxygen chains and various organic molecules. To help you keep the “sili” names straight, here is a summary table:</p> <table><caption>&#8220;Sili&#8221; Names Summary Table</caption> <tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;" colspan="2"><a href="#skiptablesili">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr><th>Silicon</th> <td>The 14th element</td> </tr> <tr><th>Silicon wafer</th> <td>A crystal of pure silicon sliced very thinly and used for electronics</td> </tr> <tr><th>Silica tetrahedron</th> <td>A combination of one silicon atom and four oxygen atoms that form a tetrahedron</td> </tr> <tr><th>% silica</th> <td>The proportion of a rock that is composed of the components Si + O<sub>2</sub></td> </tr> <tr><th>Silica</th> <td>A form of the mineral quartz (SiO<sub>2</sub>)</td> </tr> <tr><th>Silicate</th> <td>A mineral that contains silica tetrahedra (e.g., quartz, feldspar, mica, olivine)</td> </tr> <tr><th>Silicone</th> <td>A flexible material made up of Si–O chains with attached organic molecules</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id="skiptablesili">As described in Chapter 1, all minerals are characterized by a specific three-dimensional pattern known as a lattice or crystal structure. These structures range from the simple cubic pattern of halite (NaCl) (Figure 1.4), to the very complex patterns of some silicate minerals. Two minerals may have the same composition, but very different crystal structures and properties. Graphite and diamond, for example, are both composed only of carbon, but while diamond is the hardest substance known, graphite is softer than paper. Their lattice structures are compared in Figure 2.7.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_2961" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2961" style="width: 483px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/geo-e1478102487272.png"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/geo-e1478102487272.png" alt="Lattices of graphite and diamond.

The most important oxides are the iron oxides hematite and magnetite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> and Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub>, respectively). Both of these are important ores of iron. Corundum (Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>) is an abrasive, but can also be a gemstone in its ruby and sapphire varieties.

These include minerals such as quartz, feldspar, mica, amphibole, pyroxene, olivine, and a great variety of clay minerals. The building block of all of these minerals is the <strong>silica tetrahedron</strong>, a combination of four oxygen atoms and one silicon atom. These are arranged such that planes drawn through the oxygen atoms form a tetrahedron (Figure 2.6). Since the silicon ion has a charge of +4 and each of the four oxygen ions has a charge of –2, the silica tetrahedron has a net charge of –4.</p> <p>In silicate minerals, these tetrahedra are arranged and linked together in a variety of ways, from single units to complex frameworks (Figure 2.9). The simplest silicate structure, that of the mineral <strong>olivine</strong>, is composed of isolated tetrahedra bonded to iron and/or magnesium ions. In olivine, the –4 charge of each silica tetrahedron is balanced by two <strong>divalent</strong> (i.e., +2) iron or magnesium cations. Olivine can be either Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> or Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>, or some combination of the two (Mg,Fe)<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>. The divalent cations of magnesium and iron are quite close in radius (0.73 versus 0.62 angstroms<span class="footnote">An angstrom is the unit commonly used for the expression of atomic-scale dimensions. One angstrom is 10–10 m or 0.0000000001 m. The symbol for an angstrom is Å.</span>). Because of this size similarity, and because they are both divalent cations (both have a charge of +2), iron and magnesium can readily substitute for each other in olivine and in many other minerals.</p> <table><caption>Figure 2.9 Silicate mineral configurations.

This allows them to substitute for each other in some silicate minerals. In fact, the common ions in silicate minerals have a wide range of sizes, as shown in Figure 2.11. All of the ions shown are cations, except for oxygen. Note that iron can exist as both a +2 ion (if it loses two electrons during ionization) or a +3 ion (if it loses three).

In <strong>pyroxene,</strong> silica tetrahedra are linked together in a single chain, where one oxygen ion from each tetrahedron is shared with the adjacent tetrahedron, hence there are fewer oxygens in the structure. The result is that the oxygen-to-silicon ratio is lower than in olivine (3:1 instead of 4:1), and the net charge per silicon atom is less (–2 instead of –4), since fewer cations are necessary to balance that charge. Pyroxene compositions are of the type MgSiO<sub>3</sub>, FeSiO<sub>3</sub>, and CaSiO<sub>3</sub>, or some combination of these. Pyroxene can also be written as (Mg,Fe,Ca)SiO<sub>3</sub>, where the elements in the brackets can be present in any proportion. In other words, pyroxene has one cation for each silica tetrahedron (e.g., MgSiO<sub>3</sub>) while olivine has two (e.g., Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). Because each silicon ion is +4 and each oxygen ion is –2, the three oxygens (–6) and the one silicon (+4) give a net charge of –2 for the single chain of silica tetrahedra. In pyroxene, the one divalent cation (2+) per tetrahedron balances that –2 charge. In olivine, it takes two divalent cations to balance the –4 charge of an isolated tetrahedron.</p> <p>The structure of pyroxene is more “permissive” than that of olivine — meaning that cations with a wider range of ionic radii can fit into it. That’s why pyroxenes can have iron (radius 0.63 Å) or magnesium (radius 0.72 Å) or calcium (radius 1.00 Å) cations.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_56" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/pyroxene.png"><img width="400" height="323" class="wp-image-56" alt="Figure 2.12 A depiction of the structure of pyroxene.

Hornblende, for example, can include sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron, aluminum, silicon, oxygen, fluorine, and the hydroxyl ion (OH<sup>–</sup>).</p> </div> <p>In <strong>mica</strong> structures, the silica tetrahedra are arranged in continuous sheets, where each tetrahedron shares three oxygen anions with adjacent tetrahedra. There is even more sharing of oxygens between adjacent tetrahedra and hence fewer charge-balancing cations are needed for sheet silicate minerals. Bonding between sheets is relatively weak, and this accounts for the well-developed one-directional cleavage (Figure 2.14). <strong>Biotite</strong> mica can have iron and/or magnesium in it and that makes it a <strong>ferromagnesian</strong> silicate mineral (like olivine, pyroxene, and amphibole). <strong>Chlorite</strong> is another similar mineral that commonly includes magnesium. In <strong>muscovite</strong> mica, the only cations present are aluminum and potassium; hence it is a non-ferromagnesian silicate mineral.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_154" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-154" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/mica2.png"><img width="400" height="128" class="wp-image-154" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/mica2-1024x327.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-154">Figure 2.14 Biotite mica (left) and muscovite mica (right).

(Each sample is about 3 cm across.)</div></div> <p>Apart from muscovite, biotite, and chlorite, there are many other <strong>sheet silicates</strong> (or <strong>phyllosilicates</strong>), which usually exist as clay-sized fragments (i.e., less than 0.004 mm). These include the clay minerals <strong>kaolinite</strong>, <strong>illite,</strong> and <strong>smectite</strong>, and although they are difficult to study because of their very small size, they are extremely important components of rocks and especially of soils.</p> <p>All of the sheet silicate minerals also have water in their structure.</p> <p>Silica tetrahedra are bonded in three-dimensional frameworks in both the <strong>feldspars</strong> and <strong>quartz</strong>. These are <strong>non-ferromagnesian minerals</strong> — they don&#8217;t contain any iron or magnesium. In addition to silica tetrahedra, feldspars include the cations aluminum, potassium, sodium, and calcium in various combinations. Quartz contains only silica tetrahedra.</p> <p>The three main <strong>feldspar</strong> minerals are <strong>potassium feldspar</strong>, (a.k.a. <strong>K-feldspar</strong> or K-spar) and two types of plagioclase feldspar: <strong>albite</strong> (sodium only) and <strong>anorthite</strong> (calcium only). As is the case for iron and magnesium in olivine, there is a continuous range of compositions (solid solution series) between albite and anorthite in plagioclase. This is because the calcium and sodium ions are almost identical in size (1.00 Å versus 0.99 Å). Any intermediate compositions between CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> and NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> can exist (Figure 2.15). This is a little bit surprising because, although they are very similar in size, calcium and sodium ions don’t have the same charge (Ca<sup>2+</sup> versus Na+). This problem is accounted for by corresponding substitution of Al<sup>3+</sup> for Si<sup>4+</sup>. Therefore, albite is NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (one Al and three Si) while anorthite is CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub> (two Al and two Si), and plagioclase feldspars of intermediate composition have intermediate proportions of Al and Si. This is called a “coupled-substitution.”</p> <p>The intermediate-composition plagioclase feldspars are oligoclase (10% to 30% Ca), andesine (30% to 50% Ca), labradorite (50% to 70% Ca), and bytownite (70% to 90% Ca). <strong>K-feldspar</strong> (KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) has a slightly different structure than that of plagioclase, owing to the larger size of the potassium ion (1.37 Å) and because of this large size, potassium and sodium do not readily substitute for each other, except at high temperatures. These high-temperature feldspars are likely to be found only in volcanic rocks because intrusive igneous rocks cool slowly enough to low temperatures for the feldspars to change into one of the lower-temperature forms.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_63" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-63" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/feldspar-minerals.png"><img width="300" height="240" class="wp-image-63" alt="Figure 2.15 Compositions of the feldspar minerals" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/feldspar-minerals.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-63">Figure 2.15 Compositions of the feldspar minerals</div></div> <p>In <strong>quartz </strong>(SiO<sub>2</sub>)<strong>,</strong> the silica tetrahedra are bonded in a “perfect” three-dimensional framework.

Since the one silicon cation has a +4 charge and the two oxygen anions each have a –2 charge, the charge is balanced.

Time is one of the most important factors because it takes time for atoms to become ordered. If time is limited, the mineral grains will remain very small. The presence of water enhances the mobility of ions and can lead to the formation of larger crystals over shorter time periods.</p> <p>Most of the minerals that make up the rocks around us formed through the cooling of molten rock, known as <strong>magma</strong>. At the high temperatures that exist deep within Earth, some geological materials are liquid. As magma rises up through the crust, either by volcanic eruption or by more gradual processes, it cools and minerals crystallize. If the cooling process is rapid (minutes, hours, days, or years), the components of the minerals will not have time to become ordered and only small crystals can form before the rock becomes solid. The resulting rock will be fine-grained (i.e., crystals less than 1 mm). If the cooling is slow (from decades to millions of years), the degree of ordering will be higher and relatively large crystals will form. In some cases, the cooling will be so fast (seconds) that the texture will be glassy, which means that no crystals at all form. <strong>Volcanic glass</strong> is not composed of minerals because the magma has cooled too rapidly for crystals to grow, although over time (millions of years) the volcanic glass may crystallize into various silicate minerals.</p> <p>Minerals can also form in several other ways:</p> <ul><li>Precipitation from aqueous solution (i.e., from hot water flowing underground, from evaporation of a lake or inland sea, or in some cases, directly from seawater)</li> <li>Precipitation from gaseous emanations (e.g., in volcanic regions as shown in Figure 2.1)</li> <li>Metamorphism — formation of new minerals directly from the elements within existing minerals under conditions of elevated temperature and pressure</li> <li>Weathering — during which minerals unstable at Earth’s surface may be altered to other minerals</li> <li>Organic formation — formation of minerals within shells (primarily calcite) and teeth and bones (primarily apatite) by organisms (these organically formed minerals are still called minerals because they can also form inorganically)</li> </ul> <p>Opal is a mineraloid, because although it has all of the other properties of a mineral, it does not have a specific structure.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-2-6-mineral-properties" title="2.6 Mineral Properties"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">13</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">2.6 Mineral Properties</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>Minerals are universal. A crystal of hematite on Mars will have the same properties as one on Earth, and the same as one on a planet orbiting another star. That’s good news for geology students who are planning interplanetary travel since we can use those properties to help us identify minerals anywhere. That doesn’t mean that it’s easy, however; identification of minerals takes a lot of practice. Some of the mineral properties that are useful for identification are as follows:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td>Colour</td> <td>Streak</td> <td>Lustre</td> <td>Hardness</td> </tr> <tr><td>Habit</td> <td>Cleavage/fracture</td> <td>Density</td> <td>Other</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h1><strong>Colour</strong></h1> <p>For most of us, colour is one of our key ways of identifying objects. While some minerals have particularly distinctive colours that make good diagnostic properties, many do not, and for many, colour is simply unreliable. The mineral sulphur (Figures 2.1 and 2.16) is always a distinctive and unique yellow. Hematite, on the other hand, is an example of a mineral for which colour is not diagnostic. In some forms hematite is deep dull red, but in others it is black and shiny metallic (Figure 2.16). Many other minerals can have a wide range of colours (e.g., quartz, feldspar, amphibole, fluorite, and calcite). In most cases, the variations in colours are a result of varying proportions of trace elements within the mineral. In the case of quartz, for example, yellow quartz (citrine) has trace amounts of ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), rose quartz has trace amounts of manganese, purple quartz (amethyst) has trace amounts of iron, and milky quartz, which is very common, has millions of fluid inclusions (tiny cavities, each filled with water).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_841" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-841" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/colours.png"><img width="300" height="130" class="wp-image-841 size-medium" alt="Figure 2.16 Examples of the colours of the minerals sulphur and hematite" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/colours-300x130.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-841">Figure 2.16 Examples of the colours of the minerals sulphur and hematite</div></div> <h1><strong>Streak</strong></h1> <p>In the context of minerals, “colour” is what you see when light reflects off the surface of the sample. One reason that colour can be so variable is that the type of surface is variable. If we grind a small amount of the sample to a powder we get a much better indication of its actual colour. This can easily be done by scraping a corner of the sample across a streak plate (a piece of unglazed porcelain). The result is that some of the mineral gets ground to a powder and we can get a better impression of its “true” colour (Figure 2.17).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_847" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-847" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/hem-1.jpg"><img width="300" height="294" class="size-medium wp-image-847" alt="Figure 2.17 The streak colours of earthy hematite (left) and specular hematite (right).

Although the specular hematite streak looks close to black, it does have red undertones that you can see if you look closely. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><strong>Lustre</strong></h1> <p>Lustre is the way light reflects off the surface of a mineral, and the degree to which it penetrates into the interior. The key distinction is between <strong>metallic</strong> and <strong>non-metallic</strong> <strong>lustres</strong>. Light does not pass through metals, and that is the main reason they look “metallic.” Even a thin sheet of metal — such as aluminum foil — will prevent light from passing through it. Many non-metallic minerals may look as if light will not pass through them, but if you take a closer look at a thin edge of the mineral you can see that it does. If a non-metallic mineral has a shiny, reflective surface, then it is called “glassy.” If it is dull and non-reflective, it is “earthy.” Other types of non-metallic lustres are “silky,” “pearly,” and “resinous.” Lustre is a good diagnostic property, since most minerals will always appear either metallic or non-metallic. There are a few exceptions to this (e.g., hematite in Figure 2.16).</p> <h1><strong>Hardness</strong></h1> <p>One of the most important diagnostic properties of a mineral is its hardness. In 1812 German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs came up with a list of 10 reasonably common minerals that had a wide range of hardness. These minerals are shown in Figure 2.18, with the Mohs scale of hardness along the bottom axis. In fact, while each mineral on the list is harder than the one before it, the relative measured hardnesses (vertical axis) are not linear. For example apatite is about three times harder than fluorite and diamond is three times harder than corundum. Some commonly available reference materials are also shown on this diagram, including a typical fingernail (2.5), a piece of copper wire (3.5), a knife blade or a piece of window glass (5.5), a hardened steel file (6.5), and a porcelain streak plate (7). These are tools that a geologist can use to measure the hardness of unknown minerals. For example, if you have a mineral that you can’t scratch with your fingernail, but you can scratch with a copper wire, then its hardness is between 2.5 and 3.5. And of course the minerals themselves can be used to test other minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_70" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-70" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Mohs-scale-of-hardness.png"><img width="400" height="388" class="wp-image-70" alt="Figure 2.18 Minerals and reference materials in the Mohs scale of hardness.

The “measured hardness” values are Vickers Hardness numbers.</div></div> <h1><strong>Crystal Habit</strong></h1> <p>When minerals form within rocks, there is a possibility that they will form in distinctive crystal shapes if they are not crowded out by other pre-existing minerals. Every mineral has one or more distinctive crystal <strong>habits</strong>, but it is not that common, in ordinary rocks, for the shapes to be obvious. Quartz, for example, will form six-sided prisms with pointed ends, but this typically happens only when it crystallizes from a hot water solution within a cavity in an existing rock (Figure 2.19). Pyrite can form cubic crystals (Figure 2.19), but can also form crystals with 12 faces, known as <strong>dodecahedra</strong> (“dodeca” means 12). The mineral garnet also forms dodecahedral crystals (Figure 2.19).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Hexagonal-prisms.png"><img width="400" height="120" class="wp-image-71" alt="Figure 2.19 Hexagonal prisms of quartz (left), cubic crystals of pyrite (centre) and a dodecahedral crystal of garnet (right).

However, there are several minerals for which it is important. One is garnet, which is common in some metamorphic rocks and typically displays the dodecahedral shape. Another is amphibole, which forms long thin crystals, and is common in igneous rocks like granite (Figure 1.5).</p> <p>Mineral habit is often related to the regular arrangement of the molecules that make up the mineral. Some of the terms that are used to describe habit include bladed, botryoidal (grape-like), dendritic (branched), drusy (an encrustation of minerals), equant (similar in all dimensions), fibrous, platy, prismatic (long and thin), and stubby.</p> <h1><strong>Cleavage and fracture</strong></h1> <p>Crystal habit is a reflection of how a mineral grows, while cleavage and fracture describe how it breaks. These characteristics are the most important diagnostic features of many minerals, and often the most difficult to understand and identify. <strong>Cleavage</strong> is what we see when a mineral breaks along a specific plane or planes, while <strong>fracture</strong> is an irregular break. Some minerals tend to cleave along planes at various fixed orientations, some do not cleave at all (they only fracture). Minerals that have cleavage can also fracture along surfaces that are not parallel to their cleavage planes.</p> <p>As we’ve already discussed, the way that minerals break is determined by their atomic arrangement and specifically by the orientation of weaknesses within the lattice. Graphite and the micas, for example, have cleavage planes parallel to their sheets (Figures 2.7 and 2.14), and halite has three cleavage planes parallel to the lattice directions (Figure 2.8).</p> <p>Quartz has no cleavage because it has equally strong Si<sup>–</sup>O bonds in all directions, and feldspar has two cleavages at 90° to each other (Figure 1.5).</p> <p>One of the main difficulties with recognizing and describing cleavage is that it is visible only in individual crystals. Most rocks have small crystals and it’s very difficult to see the cleavage within a small crystal. Geology students have to work hard to understand and recognize cleavage, but it’s worth the effort since it is a reliable diagnostic property for most minerals.</p> <h1><strong>Density</strong></h1> <p><strong>Density</strong> is a measure of the mass of a mineral per unit volume, and it is a useful diagnostic tool in some cases. Most common minerals, such as quartz, feldspar, calcite, amphibole, and mica, have what we call “average density” (2.6 to 3.0 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), and it would be difficult to tell them apart on the basis of their density. On the other hand, many of the metallic minerals, such as pyrite, hematite, and magnetite, have densities over 5 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. They can easily be distinguished from the lighter minerals on the basis of density, but not necessarily from each other. A limitation of using density as a diagnostic tool is that one cannot assess it in minerals that are a small part of a rock with other minerals in it.</p> <h1><strong>Other properties</strong></h1> <p>Several other properties are also useful for identification of some minerals. For example, calcite is soluble in dilute acid and will give off bubbles of carbon dioxide. Magnetite is magnetic, so will affect a magnet. A few other minerals are weakly magnetic.</p> <h3>Attributions</h3> <p><strong>Figure 2.19</strong><br /> <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File%3AQuartz_Br%C3%A9sil.jpg">Quartz Bresil</a> by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Archaeodontosaurus">Didier Descouens</a> is under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0</a><br /> <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrite#mediaviewer/File:2780M-pyrite1.jpg">Pyrite cubic crystals on marlstone</a> by Carles Millan is under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY SA 3.0<br /> </a><a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Almandine.jpeg#filehistory">Almandine garnet</a> by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Almandine.jpeg#filehistory">Eurico Zimbres (FGEL/UERJ) and Tom Epaminondas (mineral collector)</a> is under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/br/deed.en">CC BY SA 2.0</a></p> </div></div>

Oxygen, the most abundant element in magma, comprises a little less than half the total, followed by silicon at just over one-quarter. The remaining elements make up the other one-quarter. Magmas derived from crustal material are dominated by oxygen, silicon, aluminum, sodium, and potassium.</p> <p>The composition of magma depends on the rock it was formed from (by melting), and the conditions of that melting. Magmas derived from the mantle have higher levels of iron, magnesium, and calcium, but they are still likely to be dominated by oxygen and silicon. All magmas have varying proportions of elements such as hydrogen, carbon, and sulphur, which are converted into gases like water vapour, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen sulphide as the magma cools.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_857" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-857" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/earths-crust2.png"><img width="300" height="207" class="size-medium wp-image-857" alt="Figure 3.6 Average elemental proportions in Earth’s crust, which is close to the average composition of magmas within the crust [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/earths-crust2-300x207.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-857">Figure 3.6 Average elemental proportions in Earth’s crust, which is close to the average composition of magmas within the crust [SE]</div></div> <p>Virtually all of the igneous rocks that we see on Earth are derived from magmas that formed from <strong>partial melting</strong> of existing rock, either in the upper mantle or the crust. Partial melting is what happens when only some parts of a rock melt; it takes place because rocks are not pure materials. Most rocks are made up of several minerals, each of which has a different melting temperature. The wax in a candle is a pure material. If you put some wax into a warm oven (50°C will do as the melting temperature of most wax is about 40°C) and leave it there for a while, it will soon start to melt. That’s complete melting, not partial melting. If instead you took a mixture of wax, plastic, aluminum, and glass and put it into the same warm oven, the wax would soon start to melt, but the plastic, aluminum, and glass would not melt (Figure 3.7a). That’s partial melting and the result would be solid plastic, aluminum, and glass surrounded by liquid wax (Figure 3.7b). If we heat the oven up to around 120°C, the plastic would melt too and mix with the liquid wax, but the aluminum and glass would remain solid (Figure 3.7c). Again this is partial melting. If we separated the wax/plastic “magma” from the other components and let it cool, it would eventually harden. As you can see from Figure 3.7d, the liquid wax and plastic have mixed, and on cooling, have formed what looks like a single solid substance. It is most likely that this is a very fine-grained mixture of solid wax and solid plastic, but it could also be some other substance that has formed from the combination of the two.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_216" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-216" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/partial_melting.png"><img width="400" height="398" class="wp-image-216" alt="partialPartial melting of “pretend rock”.

[SE]</div></div> <p>In this example, we partially melted some pretend rock to create some pretend magma. We then separated the magma from the source and allowed it to cool to make a new pretend rock with a composition quite different from the original material (it lacks glass and aluminum).</p> <p>Of course partial melting in the real world isn’t exactly the same as in our pretend-rock example. The main differences are that rocks are much more complex than the four-component system we used, and the mineral components of most rocks have more similar melting temperatures, so two or more minerals are likely to melt at the same time to varying degrees. Another important difference is that when rocks melt, the process takes thousands to millions of years, not the 90 minutes it took in the pretend-rock example.</p> <p>Contrary to what one might expect, and contrary to what we did to make our pretend rock, most partial melting of real rock does not involve heating the rock up. The two main mechanisms through which rocks melt are <strong>decompression melting</strong> and <strong>flux melting</strong>. Decompression melting takes place within Earth when a body of rock is held at approximately the same temperature but the pressure is reduced. This happens because the rock is being moved toward the surface, either at a <strong>mantle plume</strong> (a.k.a., hot spot), or in the upwelling part of a mantle convection cell.<span class="footnote">Mantle plumes are described in Chapter 4 and mantle convection in Chapter 9.</span> The mechanism of decompression melting is shown in Figure 3.8a. If a rock that is hot enough to be close to its melting point is moved toward the surface, the pressure is reduced, and the rock can pass to the liquid side of its melting curve. At this point, <em>partial</em> melting starts to take place. The process of flux melting is shown in Figure 3.8b. If a rock is close to its melting point and some water (a flux that promotes melting) is added to the rock, the melting temperature is reduced (solid line versus dotted line), and partial melting starts.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_858" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-858" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/flux-decompression.png"><img width="300" height="136" class="size-medium wp-image-858" alt="Figure 3.8 Mechanisms for (a) decompression melting (the rock is moved toward the surface) and (b) flux melting (water is added to the rock) and the melting curve is displaced.

[SE]</div></div> <p>The partial melting of rock happens in a wide range of situations, most of which are related to plate tectonics. The more important of these are shown in Figure 3.9. At both mantle plumes and in the upward parts of convection systems, rock is being moved toward the surface, the pressure is dropping, and at some point, the rock crosses to the liquid side of its melting curve. At subduction zones, water from the wet, subducting oceanic crust is transferred into the overlying hot mantle. This provides the flux needed to lower the melting temperature. In both of these cases, only partial melting takes place — typically only about 10% of the rock melts — and it is always the most silica-rich components of the rock that melt, creating a magma that is more silica-rich than the rock from which it is derived. (By analogy, the melt from our pretend rock is richer in wax and plastic than the “rock” from which it was derived.) The magma produced, being less dense than the surrounding rock, moves up through the mantle, and eventually into the crust.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-866" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/magma-formation2.png"><img width="300" height="131" class="size-medium wp-image-866" alt="Figure 3.9 Common sites of magma formation in the upper mantle.

This typically leads to partial melting of the surrounding rock because most such magmas are hotter than the melting temperature of crustal rock. (In this case, melting is caused by an increase in temperature.) Again, the more silica-rich parts of the surrounding rock are preferentially melted, and this contributes to an increase in the silica content of the magma.</p> <p>At very high temperatures (over 1300°C), most magma is entirely liquid because there is too much energy for the atoms to bond together. As the temperature drops, usually because the magma is slowly moving upward, things start to change. Silicon and oxygen combine to form silica tetrahedra, and then, as cooling continues, the tetrahedra start to link together to make chains (<strong>polymerize</strong>). These silica chains have the important effect of making the magma more viscous (less runny), and as we’ll see in Chapter 4, magma viscosity has significant implications for volcanic eruptions. As the magma continues to cool, crystals start to form.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 3.2 Making Magma Viscous</strong></p> <p>This is an experiment that you can do at home to help you understand the properties of magma.

Take another 4 teaspoons (20 mL)of flour and mix it thoroughly with about 4 teaspoons (20 mL) of water in a cup and then add all of that mixture to the rest of the water and flour in the saucepan.

This explains why a cooling magma can have some crystals within it and yet remain predominantly liquid. The sequence in which minerals crystallize from a magma is known as the <strong>Bowen reaction series</strong> (Figure 3.10 and Who was Bowen).</p> <p>Of the common silicate minerals, olivine normally crystallizes first, at between 1200° and 1300°C. As the temperature drops, and assuming that some silica remains in the magma, the olivine crystals react (combine) with some of the silica in the magma (see Box 3.1) to form pyroxene. As long as there is silica remaining and the rate of cooling is slow, this process continues down the discontinuous branch: olivine to pyroxene, pyroxene to amphibole, and (under the right conditions) amphibole to biotite.</p> <p>At about the point where pyroxene begins to crystallize, plagioclase feldspar also begins to crystallize. At that temperature, the plagioclase is calcium-rich (anorthite) (see Figure 2.15). As the temperature drops, and providing that there is sodium left in the magma, the plagioclase that forms is a more sodium-rich variety.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_854" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-854" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/Bowen-reaction2.png"><img width="300" height="150" class="size-medium wp-image-854" alt="Figure 3.10 The Bowen reaction series describes the process of magma crystallization [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Bowen-reaction2-300x150.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-854">Figure 3.10 The Bowen reaction series describes the process of magma crystallization [SE]</div></div> <h1><strong>Who was Bowen, and what’s a reaction series?</strong></h1> <p>Norman Levi Bowen, born in Kingston Ontario, studied geology at Queen’s University and then at MIT in Boston. In 1912, he joined the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he carried out groundbreaking experimental research into the processes of cooling magmas. Working mostly with basaltic magmas, he determined the order of crystallization of minerals as the temperature drops. The method, in brief, was to melt the rock to a magma in a specially made kiln, allow it to cool slowly to a specific temperature (allowing some minerals to form), and then quench it (cool it quickly) so that no new minerals form (only glass). The results were studied under the microscope and by chemical analysis. This was done over and over, each time allowing the magma to cool to a lower temperature before quenching.</p> <p><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/bowen-3.jpg"><img width="150" height="225" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-853" alt="bowen-3" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/bowen-3.jpg" /></a></p> <p>The Bowen reaction series is one of the results of his work, and even a century later, it is an important basis for our understanding of igneous rocks. The word <em>reaction </em>is critical. In the discontinuous branch, olivine is typically the first mineral to form (at just below 1300°C). As the temperature continues to drop, olivine becomes unstable while pyroxene becomes stable. The early-forming olivine crystals <em>react</em> with silica in the remaining liquid magma and are converted into pyroxene, something like this:</p> <p>Mg<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub> + SiO<sub>2</sub>  &#8212;&#8212;&gt;     2MgSiO<sub>3</sub></p> <p>olivine                                       pyroxene</p> <p>This continues down the chain, as long as there is still silica left in the liquid. <em>[image from Wikipedia: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NormanLBowen_1909.jpg">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:NormanLBowen_1909.jpg</a></em><em>]</em></p> <p>In cases where cooling happens relatively quickly, individual plagioclase crystals can be zoned from calcium-rich in the centre to more sodium-rich around the outside. This occurs when calcium-rich early-forming plagioclase crystals become coated with progressively more sodium-rich plagioclase as the magma cools.

Soon after that, all of the magma is used up and no further changes takes place. The minerals present will be olivine, pyroxene, and calcium-rich plagioclase. If the magma cools slowly underground, the product will be <strong>gabbro</strong>; if it cools quickly at the surface, the product will be <strong>basalt</strong> (Figure 3.13).<em><br /> </em></p> <p><em>Felsic</em> magmas tend to be cooler than mafic magmas when crystallization begins (because they don’t have to be as hot to remain liquid), and so they may start out crystallizing pyroxene (not olivine) and plagioclase. As cooling continues, the various reactions on the discontinuous branch will proceed because silica is abundant, the plagioclase will become increasingly sodium-rich, and eventually potassium feldspar and quartz will form. Commonly even very felsic rocks will not have biotite or muscovite because they may not have enough aluminum or enough hydrogen to make the OH complexes that are necessary for mica minerals. Typical felsic rocks are <strong>granite</strong> and <strong>rhyolite</strong> (Figure 3.13).</p> <p>The cooling behaviour of intermediate magmas lie somewhere between those of mafic and felsic magmas. Typical intermediate rocks are <strong>diorite</strong> and <strong>andesite </strong>(Figure 3.13).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_859" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-859" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/igneous-rocks2.png"><img width="300" height="165" class="size-medium wp-image-859" alt="Figure 3.13 Examples of the igneous rocks that form from mafic, intermediate, and felsic magmas.

[SE]</div></div> <p>A number of processes that take place within a magma chamber can affect the types of rocks produced in the end. If the magma has a low viscosity (i.e., it’s runny) — which is likely if it is mafic — the crystals that form early, such as olivine (Figure 3.14a), may slowly settle toward the bottom of the magma chamber (Figure 3.14b). The means that the overall composition of the magma near the top of the magma chamber will become more felsic, as it is losing some iron- and magnesium-rich components. This process is known as <strong>fractional crystallization</strong>. The crystals that settle might either form an olivine-rich layer near the bottom of the magma chamber, or they might remelt because the lower part is likely to be hotter than the upper part (remember, from Chapter 1, that temperatures increase steadily with depth in Earth because of the geothermal gradient). If any melting takes place, crystal settling will make the magma at the bottom of the chamber more mafic than it was to begin with (Figure 3.14c).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-865" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/magma-chamber2.png"><img width="300" height="188" class="size-medium wp-image-865" alt="Figure 3.14 An example of crystal settling and the formation of a zoned magma chamber [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/magma-chamber2-300x188.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-865">Figure 3.14 An example of crystal settling and the formation of a zoned magma chamber [SE]</div></div> <p>If crystal settling does not take place, because the magma is too viscous, then the process of cooling will continue as predicted by the Bowen reaction series. In some cases, however, partially cooled but still liquid magma, with crystals in it, will either move farther up into a cooler part of the crust, or all the way to the surface during a volcanic eruption. In either of these situations, the magma that has moved toward the surface is likely to cool much faster than it did within the magma chamber, and the rest of the rock will have a finer crystalline texture. An igneous rock with large crystals embedded in a matrix of finer crystals is indicative of a two-stage cooling process, and the texture is <strong>porphyritic</strong> (Figure 3.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-873" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/porphyry.png"><img width="300" height="114" class="size-medium wp-image-873" alt="Figure 3.15 Porphyritic textures: volcanic porphyry (left – olivine crystals in Hawaiian basalt) and intrusive porphyry (right) [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/porphyry-300x114.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-873">Figure 3.15 Porphyritic textures: volcanic porphyry (left – olivine crystals in Hawaiian basalt) and intrusive porphyry (right) [SE]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 3.4 Porphyritic Minerals</strong></p> <p>As a magma cools below 1300°C, minerals start to crystallize within it.

The diagram in Figure 3.16 can be used to help classify igneous rocks by their mineral composition. An important feature to note on this diagram is the red line separating the non-ferromagnesian silicates in the lower left (K-feldspar, quartz, and plagioclase feldspar) from the ferromagnesian silicates in the upper right (biotite, amphibole, pyroxene, and olivine). In classifying intrusive igneous rocks, the first thing to consider is the percentage of ferromagnesian silicates. That’s relatively easy in most igneous rocks because the ferromagnesian minerals are clearly darker than the others. At the same time, it’s quite difficult to estimate the proportions of minerals in a rock.</p> <p>Based on the position of the red line in Figure 3.16, it is evident that felsic rocks can have about 1% to 20% ferromagnesian silicates (the red line intersects the left side of the felsic zone 1% of the distance from the top of the diagram, and it intersects the right side of the felsic zone 20% of the distance from the top). Intermediate rocks have between 20% and 50% ferromagnesian silicates, and mafic rocks have 50% to 100% ferromagnesian silicates. To be more specific, felsic rocks typically have biotite and/or amphibole; intermediate rocks have amphibole and, in some cases, pyroxene; and mafic rocks have pyroxene and, in some cases, olivine.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_860" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-860" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/ingeous-rocks2.png"><img width="300" height="139" class="size-medium wp-image-860" alt="Figure 3.16 A simplified classification diagram for igneous rocks based on their mineral compositions [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/ingeous-rocks2-300x139.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-860">Figure 3.16 A simplified classification diagram for igneous rocks based on their mineral compositions [SE]</div></div> <p>If we focus on the non-ferromagnesian silicates, it is evident that felsic rocks can have from 0% to 35% K-feldspar, from 25% to 35% quartz (the vertical thickness of the quartz field varies from 25% to 35%), and from 25% to 50% plagioclase (and that plagioclase will be sodium-rich, or albitic).

The textures of volcanic rocks will be discussed in Chapter 4, so here we’ll only look at the different textures of intrusive igneous rocks. Almost all intrusive igneous rocks have crystals that are large enough to see with the naked eye, and we use the term </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">phaneritic</strong> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">(from the Greek word </span><em style="line-height: 1.5;">phaneros</em> <span style="line-height: 1.5;">meaning visible) to describe that. Typically that means they are larger than about 0.5 mm — the thickness of a strong line made with a ballpoint pen. (If the crystals are too small to distinguish, which is typical of most volcanic rocks, we use the term </span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;">aphanitic</strong><span style="line-height: 1.5;">.) The intrusive rocks shown in Figure 3.13 are all phaneritic, as are those shown in Exercise 3.6.</span><strong style="line-height: 1.5;"> </strong></p> <p>In general, the size of crystals is proportional to the rate of cooling. The longer it takes for a body of magma to cool, the larger the crystals will be. It is not uncommon to see an intrusive igneous rock with crystals up to a centimetre long. In some situations, especially toward the end of the cooling stage, the magma can become water rich. The presence of liquid water (still liquid at high temperatures because it is under pressure) promotes the relatively easy movement of ions, and this allows crystals to grow large, sometimes to several centimetres (Figure 3.18). As already described, if an igneous rock goes through a two-stage cooling process, its texture will be porphyritic (Figure 3.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-869" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/pegmatite2.jpg"><img width="300" height="224" class="size-medium wp-image-869" alt="Figure 3.18 A pegmatite with mica, quartz, and tourmaline (black) from the White Elephant mine, South Dakota [from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegmatite#mediaviewer/File:We-pegmatite.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/pegmatite2-300x224.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-869">Figure 3.18 A pegmatite with mica, quartz, and tourmaline (black) from the White Elephant mine, South Dakota [from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pegmatite#mediaviewer/File:We-pegmatite.jpg]</div></div> </div></div>

The distinction between the two is made on the basis of the area that is exposed at the surface: if the body has an exposed surface area greater than 100 km<sup>2</sup>, then it’s a batholith; smaller than 100 km<sup>2</sup> and it’s a stock. Batholiths are typically formed only when a number of stocks coalesce beneath the surface to create one large body. One of the largest batholiths in the world is the Coast Range Plutonic Complex, which extends all the way from the Vancouver region to southeastern Alaska (Figure 3.21). More accurately, it’s many batholiths.</p> <p>Tabular (sheet-like) plutons are distinguished on the basis of whether or not they are <strong>concordant</strong> with (parallel to) existing layering (e.g., sedimentary bedding or metamorphic foliation) in the country rock. A <strong>sill</strong> is concordant with existing layering, and a <strong>dyke</strong> is <strong>discordant</strong>. If the country rock has no bedding or foliation, then any tabular body within it is a dyke. Note that the sill-versus-dyke designation is not determined simply by the orientation of the feature. A dyke can be horizontal and a sill can be vertical (if the bedding is vertical). A large dyke can be seen in Figure 3.21.</p> <p>A <strong>laccolith</strong> is a sill-like body that has expanded upward by deforming the overlying rock.</p> <p>Finally, a <strong>pipe</strong> is a cylindrical body (with a circular, ellipitical, or even irregular cross-section) that served as a conduit for the movement of magma from one location to another. Most known pipes fed volcanoes, although pipes can also connect plutons.

And, as we’ll see in Chapter 7, the heat of a body of magma can lead to metamorphism of the country rock. The country rock can also have an effect on the magma within a pluton. The most obvious such effect is the formation of a chilled margin along the edges of the pluton, where it came in contact with country rock that was significantly colder than the magma. Within the chilled margin, the magma cooled more quickly than in the centre of the dyke, so the texture is finer and the colour may be different. An example is shown in Figure 3.22.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_863" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-863" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/mafic-dyke2.png"><img width="300" height="204" class="size-medium wp-image-863" alt="Figure 3.22 A mafic dyke with chilled margins within basalt at Nanoose, B.C.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-3-summary" title="Chapter 3 Summary"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">20</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3 Summary</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>The topics covered in this chapter can be summarized as follows:</p> <table><tbody><tr><th>3.1</th> <th>The Rock Cycle</th> <td>The three types of rocks are igneous, formed from magma; sedimentary, formed from fragments of other rocks or precipitations from solution; and metamorphic, formed when existing rocks are altered by heat, pressure, and/or chemical action. The rock cycle summarizes the processes that contribute to cycling of rock material among these three types. The rock cycle is driven by Earth’s internal heat, and by processes happening at the surface, which are driven by solar energy.</td> </tr> <tr><th>3.2</th> <th>Magma and Magma Formation</th> <td>Magma is molten rock, and in most cases, it forms from partial melting of existing rock. The two main processes of magma formation are decompression melting and flux melting. Magmas range in composition from ultramafic to felsic. Mafic rocks are rich in iron, magnesium, and calcium and have around 50% silica. Felsic rocks are rich in silica (~75%) and have lower levels of iron, magnesium, and calcium and higher levels of sodium and potassium than mafic rocks.</td> </tr> <tr><th>3.3</th> <th>Crystallization of Magma</th> <td>As a body of magma starts to cool, the first process to take place is the polymerization of silica tetrahedra into chains. This increases the magma’s viscosity (makes it thicker) and because felsic magmas have more silica than mafic magmas, they tend to be more viscous. The Bowen reaction series allows us to predict the order of crystallization of magma as it cools. Magma can be modified by fractional crystallization (separation of early-forming crystals) and by incorporation of material from the surrounding rocks by partial melting.</td> </tr> <tr><th>3.4</th> <th>Classification of Igneous Rocks</th> <td>Igneous rocks are classified based on their mineral composition and texture. Felsic igneous rocks have less than 20% ferromagnesian silicates (amphibole and/or biotite) plus varying amounts of quartz and both potassium and plagioclase feldspars. Mafic igneous rocks have more than 50% ferromagnesian silicates (primarily pyroxene) plus plagioclase feldspar. Most intrusive igneous rocks are phaneritic (crystals are visible to the naked eye). If there were two stages of cooling (slow then fast), the texture may be porphyritic (large crystals in a matrix of smaller crystals). If water was present during cooling, the texture may be pegmatitic (very large crystals).</td> </tr> <tr><th>3.5</th> <th>Intrusive Igneous Bodies</th> <td>Magma intrudes into country rock by pushing it aside or melting through it. Intrusive igneous bodies tend to be either irregular (stocks and batholiths), tabular (dykes and sills), or pipe-like. Batholiths have exposed areas of greater than 100 km<sup>2</sup>, while stocks are smaller. Sills are parallel to existing layering in the country rock, while dykes cut across layering. A pluton that intruded into cold rock it is likely to have a chilled margin.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

This can include eruptions on the ocean floor (or even under the water of lake), where they are called <strong>subaqueous eruptions</strong>, or on land, where they are called <strong>subaerial eruptions</strong>. Not all volcanic eruptions produce the volcanic mountains with which we are familiar; in fact most of Earth’s volcanism takes place along the spreading ridges on the sea floor and does not produce volcanic mountains at all — not even sea-floor mountains.</p> <p>Canada has a great deal of volcanic rock, but most of it is old, some of it billions of years old. Only in B.C. and the Yukon are there volcanoes that have been active within the past 2.6 Ma (Pleistocene or younger), and the vast majority of these are in B.C. We’ll look at those in some detail toward the end of this chapter, but a few of them are shown on Figures 4.1 and 4.2.</p> <p>The study of volcanoes is critical to our understanding of the geological evolution of Earth, and to our understanding of significant changes in climate. But, most important of all, understanding volcanic eruptions allows us to save lives and property. Over the past few decades, volcanologists have made great strides in their ability to forecast volcanic eruptions and predict the consequences — this has already saved thousands of lives.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-896" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/garibaldi-1.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-896" alt="Figure 4.1 Mt.

It is heated up, and while there isn’t enough heat to melt the subducting crust, there is enough to force the water out of some of its minerals. This water rises into the overlying mantle where it contributes to flux melting of the mantle rock. The mafic magma produced rises through the mantle to the base of the crust. There it contributes to partial melting of crustal rock, and thus it assimilates much more felsic material. That magma, now intermediate in composition, continues to rise and assimilate crustal material; in the upper part of the crust, it accumulates into plutons. From time to time, the magma from the plutons rises toward surface, leading to volcanic eruptions. Mt. Garibaldi (Figures 4.1 and 4.2) is an example of subduction-related volcanism.<strong> </strong></p> <p>A mantle plume is an ascending column of hot rock (not magma) that originates deep in the mantle, possibly just above the core-mantle boundary. Mantle plumes are thought to rise at approximately 10 times the rate of mantle convection. The ascending column may be on the order of kilometres to tens of kilometres across, but near the surface it spreads out to create a mushroom-style head that is several tens to over 100 kilometres across. Near the base of the lithosphere (the rigid part of the mantle), the mantle plume (and possibly some of the surrounding mantle material) partially melts to form mafic magma that rises to feed volcanoes. Since most mantle plumes are beneath the oceans, the early stages of volcanism typically take place on the sea floor. Over time, islands may form like those in Hawaii.</p> <p>Volcanism in northwestern B.C. (Figures 4.5 and 4.6) is related to continental rifting. This area is not at a divergent or convergent boundary, and there is no evidence of an underlying mantle plume. The crust of northwestern B.C. is being stressed by the northward movement of the Pacific Plate against the North America Plate, and the resulting crustal fracturing provides a conduit for the flow of magma from the mantle. This may be an early stage of continental rifting, such as that found in eastern Africa.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_904" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-904" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/stikine.png"><img width="300" height="291" class="size-medium wp-image-904" alt="Figure 4.5 Volcanoes and volcanic fields in the Northern Cordillera Volcanic Province, B.C.

At divergent boundaries and oceanic mantle plumes, where there is little interaction with crustal materials and magma fractionation to create felsic melts does not take place, the magma tends to be consistently mafic. At subduction zones, where the magma ascends through significant thicknesses of crust, interaction between the magma and the crustal rock — some of which is quite felsic — leads to increases in the felsic character of the magma.</p> <p>As shown in Figure 4.7, several processes can make magma that is stored in a chamber within the crust more felsic, and can also contribute to development of vertical zonation from more mafic at the bottom to more felsic at the top. Partial melting of country rock and country-rock xenoliths increases the overall felsic character of the magma; first, because the country rocks tends to be more felsic than the magma, and second, because the more felsic components of the country rock melt preferentially. Settling of ferromagnesian crystals from the upper part of the magma, and possible remelting of those crystals in the lower part can both contribute to the vertical zonation from relatively mafic at the bottom to more felsic at the top.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_296" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-296" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/magma-chambers.png"><img class="wp-image-296" alt="Magma Chambers, (1) at the top, loss of olivine or pyroxene (by crystal settling) makes the upper magma more felsic, (2) partial melting of country rock makes the magma more felsic (3) partial or complete melting of xenoliths makes the magma more felsic, (4) possible re-melting of olivine or pyroxene can make the lower magma more mafic" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/magma-chambers.png" height="331" width="300" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-296">Figure 4.7 The important processes that lead to changes in the composition of magmas stored within magma chambers within relatively felsic rocks of the crust. [SE]</div></div> <p>From the perspective of volcanism there are some important differences between felsic and mafic magmas. First, as we’ve already discussed, felsic magmas tend to be more viscous because they have more silica, and hence more polymerization. Second, felsic magmas tend to have higher levels of volatiles; that is, components that behave as gases during volcanic eruptions. The most abundant volatile in magma is water (H<sub>2</sub>O), followed typically by carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and then by sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>). The general relationship between the SiO<sub>2</sub> content of magma and the amount of volatiles is shown in Figure 4.8. Although there are many exceptions to this trend, mafic magmas typically have 1% to 3% volatiles, intermediate magmas have 3% to 4% volatiles, and felsic magmas have 4% to 7% volatiles.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_297" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-297" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/volatile-compositions.png"><img class="wp-image-297" alt="Variations in the volatile compositions of magmas as a function of silica content" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/volatile-compositions.png" height="374" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-297">Figure 4.8 Variations in the volatile compositions of magmas as a function of silica content [SE after Schminke, 2004, (Schminke, H-U., 2004, Volcanism, Springer-Verlag, Heidelberg)]</div></div> <p>Differences in viscosity and volatile level have significant implications for the nature of volcanic eruptions. When magma is deep beneath the surface and under high pressure from the surrounding rocks, the gases remain dissolved. As magma approaches the surface, the pressure exerted on it decreases. Gas bubbles start to form, and the more gas there is in the magma, the more bubbles form. If the gas content is low or the magma is runny enough for gases to rise up through it and escape to surface, the pressure will not become excessive. Assuming that it can break through to the surface, the magma will flow out relatively gently. An eruption that involves a steady non-violent flow of magma is called <strong>effusive</strong>.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><strong>Exercise 4.2 Under Pressure!</strong> <p>A good analogy for a magma chamber in the upper crust is a plastic bottle of pop on the supermarket shelf. Go to a supermarket and pick one up off the shelf (something not too dark). You’ll find that the bottle is hard because it was bottled under pressure, and you should be able to see that there are no gas bubbles inside.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Under-Pressure.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-298 size-medium" alt="Champange bottle opening" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Under-Pressure-199x300.jpg" height="300" width="199" /></a>Buy a small bottle of pop (you don’t have to drink it!) and open it. The bottle will become soft because the pressure is released, and small bubbles will start forming. If you put the lid back on and shake the bottle (best to do this outside!), you’ll enhance the processes of bubble formation, and when you open the lid, the pop will come gushing out, just like an explosive volcanic eruption.</p> <p>A pop bottle is a better analogue for a volcano than the old baking soda and vinegar experiment that you did in elementary school, because pop bottles, like volcanoes, come pre-charged with gas pressure. All we need to do is release the confining pressure and the gases come bubbling out.</p> <p>[Wikipedia image: http://upload.wikimedia.org /wikipedia/commons/6/64/Champagne_uncorking_photographed_with_a_high_speed_air-gap_flash.jpg]</p> </div> </div> <p>If the magma is felsic, and therefore too viscous for gases to escape easily, or if it has a particularly high gas content, it is likely to be under high pressure. Viscous magma doesn’t flow easily, so even if there is a way for it to move out, it may not flow out. Under these circumstances pressure will continue to build as more magma moves up from beneath and gases continue to exsolve. Eventually some part of the volcano will break and then all of that pent-up pressure will lead to an explosive eruption.</p> <p>Mantle plume and spreading-ridge magmas tend to be consistently mafic, so effusive eruptions are the norm. At subduction zones, the average magma composition is likely to be close to intermediate, but as we’ve seen, magma chambers can become zoned and so compositions ranging from felsic to mafic are possible. Eruption styles can be correspondingly variable.</p> </div></div>

(Figure 4.10), are typically only a few hundred metres in diameter, and few are more than 200 m high. Most are made up of fragments of <strong>vesicular</strong> mafic rock (scoria) that were expelled as the magma boiled when it approached the surface, creating fire fountains. In many cases, these later became effusive (lava flows) when the gases were depleted. Most cinder cones are <strong>monogenetic</strong>, meaning that they formed during a single eruptive phase that might have lasted weeks or months. Because cinder cones are made up almost exclusively of loose fragments, they have very little strength. They can be easily, and relatively quickly, eroded away.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-300" style="width: 358px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Eve-Cone.jpg"><img width="358" height="233" class="wp-image-300 size-full" alt="Eve Cone, situated near to Mt.

St. Helens in Washington State (Figure 4.11), are almost all associated with subduction at convergent plate boundaries — either ocean-continent or ocean-ocean boundaries (Figure 4.4b). They can extend up to several thousand metres from the surrounding terrain, and, with slopes ranging up to 30˚, are typically up to 10 km across.   At many such volcanoes, magma is stored in a magma chamber in the upper part of the crust. For example, at Mt. St. Helens, there is evidence of a magma chamber that is approximately 1 km wide and extends from about 6 km to 14 km below the surface (Figure 4.12). Systematic variations in the composition of volcanism over the past several thousand years at Mt. St. Helens imply that the magma chamber is zoned, from more felsic at the top to more mafic at the bottom.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_912" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-912" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/msh-3.jpg"><img width="300" height="242" class="size-medium wp-image-912" alt="Figure 4.11 The north side of Mt.

St. Helens showing the zoned magma chamber. [SE, after Pringle, 1993]</div></div> <p>Mafic eruptions (and some intermediate eruptions), on the other hand, produce lava flows; the one shown in Figure 4.13b is thick enough (about 10 m in total) to have cooled in a <strong>columnar jointing</strong> pattern (Figure 4.14). Lava flows both flatten the profile of the volcano (because the lava typically flows farther than pyroclastic debris falls) and protect the fragmental deposits from erosion. Even so, composite volcanoes tend to erode quickly. Patrick Pringle, a volcanologist with the Washington State Department of Natural Resources, describes Mt. St. Helens as a “pile of junk.” The rock that makes up Mt. St. Helens ranges in composition from rhyolite (Figure 4.13a) to basalt (Figure 4.13b); this implies that the types of past eruptions have varied widely in character. As already noted, felsic magma doesn’t flow easily and doesn’t allow gases to escape easily. Under these circumstances, pressure builds up until a conduit opens, and then an explosive eruption results from the gas-rich upper part of the magma chamber, producing <strong>pyroclastic</strong> debris, as shown on Figure 4.13a. This type of eruption can also lead to rapid melting of ice and snow on a volcano, which typically triggers large mudflows known as <strong>lahars</strong> (Figure 4.13a). Hot, fast-moving pyroclastic flows and lahars are the two main causes of casualties in volcanic eruptions. Pyroclastic flows killed approximately 30,000 people during the 1902 eruption of Mt. Pelée on the Caribbean island of Martinique. Most were incinerated in their homes. In 1985 a massive lahar, triggered by the eruption of Nevado del Ruiz, killed 23,000 people in the Colombian town of Armero, about 50 km from the volcano.</p> <p>In a geological context, composite volcanoes tend to form relatively quickly and do not last very long. Mt. St. Helens, for example, is made up of rock that is all younger than 40,000 years; most of it is younger than 3,000 years. If its volcanic activity ceases, it might erode away within a few tens of thousands of years. This is largely because of the presence of pyroclastic eruptive material, which is not strong.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_901" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-901" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/msh-3.png"><img width="300" height="158" class="size-medium wp-image-901" alt="Figure 4.13 Mt.

[SE]</div></div> <h1><strong><br /> Shield Volcanoes</strong></h1> <p>Most shield volcanoes are associated with mantle plumes, although some form at divergent boundaries, either on land or on the sea floor. Because of their non-viscous mafic magma they tend to have relatively gentle slopes (2 to 10˚) and the larger ones can be over 100 km in diameter. The best-known shield volcanoes are those that make up the Hawaiian Islands, and of these, the only active ones are on the big island of Hawaii. Mauna Loa, the world’s largest volcano and the world’s largest mountain (by volume) last erupted in 1984. Kilauea, arguably the world’s most active volcano, has been erupting, virtually without interruption, since 1983. Loihi is an underwater volcano on the southeastern side of Hawaii. It is last known to have erupted in 1996, but may have erupted since then without being detected.</p> <p>All of the Hawaiian volcanoes are related to the mantle plume that currently lies beneath Mauna Loa, Kilauea, and Loihi (Figure 4.15). In this area, the Pacific Plate is moving northwest at a rate of about 7 cm/year. This means that the earlier formed — and now extinct — volcanoes have now moved well away from the mantle plume. As shown on Figure 4.15, there is evidence of crustal magma chambers beneath all three active Hawaiian volcanoes. At Kilauea, the magma chamber appears to be several kilometres in diameter, and is situated between 8 km and 11 km below surface.<span class="footnote">Lin, G, Amelung, F, Lavallee, Y, and Okubo, P, 2014, Seismic evidence for a crustal magma reservoir beneath the upper east rift zone of Kilauea volcano, Hawaii.

A caldera is a volcanic <strong>crater</strong> that is more than 2 km in diameter; this one is 4 km long and 3 km wide. It contains a smaller feature called Halema’uma’u crater, which has a total depth of over 200 m below the surrounding area. Most volcanic craters and calderas are formed above magma chambers, and the level of the crater floor is influenced by the amount of pressure exerted by the magma body. During historical times, the floors of both Kilauea caldera and Halema’uma’u crater have moved up during expansion of the magma chamber and down during deflation of the chamber.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_310" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-310" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Kilauea-caldera.jpg"><img width="400" height="227" class="wp-image-310" alt="Aerial view of the Kilauea caldera.

As is typical in magmatic regions, water is the main volatile component, followed by carbon dioxide and sulphur dioxide. These, and some minor gases, originate from the magma chamber at depth and rise up through cracks in the overlying rock. This degassing of the magma is critical to the style of eruption at Kilauea, which, for most of the past 30 years, has been effusive, not explosive.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-899" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/kilauea-monitor.png"><img width="300" height="127" class="size-medium wp-image-899" alt="Figure 4.17 A gas-composition monitoring station (left) within the Kilauea caldera and at the edge of Halema’uma’u crater.

[SE photos]</div></div> <p>The Kilauea eruption that began in 1983 started with the formation of a cinder cone at Pu’u ’O’o, approximately 15 km east of the caldera (Figure 4.18). The magma feeding this eruption flowed along a major conduit system known as the East Rift, which extends for about 20 km from the caldera, first southeast and then east. Lava fountaining and construction of the Pu’u ’O’o cinder cone (Figure 4.19a) continued until 1986 at which time the flow became effusive. From 1986 to 2014, lava flowed from a gap in the southern flank of Pu’u ’O’o down the slope of Kilauea through a <strong>lava tube </strong>(Figure 4.19d), emerging at or near the ocean. Since June 2014, the lava has flowed northeast (see Exercise 4.4).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-312" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Kilauea-volcano.png"><img width="400" height="141" class="wp-image-312" alt="atellite image of Kilauea volcano showing the East rift and Pu’u ’O’o, the site of the eruption that started in 1983." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Kilauea-volcano.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-312">Figure 4.18 Satellite image of Kilauea volcano showing the East rift and Pu’u ’O’o, the site of the eruption that started in 1983.

The red glow is from a stream of very hot lava (~1200°C) that has flowed underground for most of the 8 km from the Pu’u ’O’o vent. Lava tubes form naturally and readily on both shield and composite volcanoes because flowing mafic lava preferentially cools near its margins, forming solid <strong>lava levées</strong> that eventually close over the top of the flow. The magma within a lava tube is not exposed to the air, so it remains hot and fluid and can flow for tens of kilometres, thus contributing to the large size and low slopes of shield volcanoes. The Hawaiian volcanoes are riddled with thousands of old lava tubes, some as long as 50 km.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_898" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-898" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/kilauea-lavas.png"><img width="300" height="206" class="size-medium wp-image-898" alt="Figure 4.19 Images of Kilauea volcano taken in 2002 (b &amp; c) and 2007 (a &amp; d) [SE photos] (a) Pu'u'O'o cinder cone in the background with tephra in the foreground and aa lava in the middle, (b) Formation of pahoehoe on the southern edge of Kilauea, (c) Formation of aa on a steep slope on Kilauea, (d) Skylight in an active lava tube, Kilauea." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/kilauea-lavas-300x206.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-898">Figure 4.19 Images of Kilauea volcano taken in 2002 (b &amp; c) and 2007 (a &amp; d) [SE photos] (a) Pu&#8217;u&#8217;O&#8217;o cinder cone in the background with tephra in the foreground and aa lava in the middle, (b) Formation of pahoehoe on the southern edge of Kilauea, (c) Formation of aa on a steep slope on Kilauea, (d) Skylight in an active lava tube, Kilauea.</div></div> <p>Kilauea is approximately 300 ka old, while neighbouring Mauna Loa is over 700 ka and Mauna Kea is over 1 Ma.

By that time, its neighbour, Loihi, will have emerged from the sea floor, and its other neighbours, Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, will have become significantly eroded, like their cousins, the islands to the northwest (Figure 4.15).</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 4.4 Kilauea’s June 27th Lava Flow</strong></p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey Hawaii Volcano Observatory (HVO) map shown here, dated January 29, 2015, shows the outline of lava that started flowing northeast from Pu’u ’O’o on June 27, 2004 (the “June 27th Lava flow,” a.k.a. the “East Rift Lava Flow”).

The Siberian Traps (also basalt), which erupted at the end of the Permian period at 250 Ma, are estimated to have produced approximately 40 times as much lava as the CRBG.</p> <p>The mantle plume that is assumed to be responsible for the CRBG is now situated beneath the Yellowstone area, where it leads to felsic volcanism. Over the past 2 Ma three very large explosive eruptions at Yellowstone have yielded approximately 900 km<sup>3</sup> of felsic magma, about 900 times the volume of the 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens, but only 5% of the volume of mafic magma in the CRBG.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h1><strong>Sea-Floor Volcanism</strong></h1> <p>Some LIP eruptions occur on the sea floor, the largest being the one that created the Ontong Java plateau in the western Pacific Ocean at around 122 Ma. But most sea-floor volcanism originates at divergent boundaries and involves relatively low-volume eruptions. Under these conditions, hot lava that oozes out into the cold seawater quickly cools on the outside and then behaves a little like toothpaste. The resulting blobs of lava are known as <strong>pillows</strong>, and they tend to form piles around a sea-floor lava vent (Figure 4.21). In terms of area, there is very likely more pillow basalt on the sea floor than any other type of rock on Earth.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_902" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-902" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/pillows.png"><img width="300" height="108" class="size-medium wp-image-902" alt="Figure 4.21 Modern and ancient sea-floor pillow basalts (left) Modern sea-floor pillows in the south Pacific [NOAA, from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ Basalt#mediaviewer/File:Pillow_basalt_crop_l.jpg] (right) Eroded 40 to 50 Ma pillows on the shore of Vancouver Island, near to Sooke.

During a kimberlite eruption, material from this depth may make its way to surface quickly (hours to days) with little interaction with the surrounding rocks. As a result, kimberlite eruptive material is representative of mantle compositions: it is ultramafic.</p> <p>Kimberlite eruptions that originate at depths greater than 200 km, within areas beneath old thick crust (<strong>shields</strong>), traverse the region of stability of diamond in the mantle, and in some cases, bring diamond-bearing material to the surface. All of the diamond deposits on Earth are assumed to have formed in this way; an example is the rich Ekati Mine in the Northwest Territories (Figure 4.22).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_895" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-895" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/ekati.png"><img width="300" height="120" class="size-medium wp-image-895" alt="Figure 4.22 Ekati diamond mine, Northwest Territories, part of the Lac de Gras kimberlite field [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Ekati_mine_640px.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/ekati-300x120.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-895">Figure 4.22 Ekati diamond mine, Northwest Territories, part of the Lac de Gras kimberlite field [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/Ekati_mine_640px.jpg]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The kimberlites at Ekati erupted between 45 and 60 Ma.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-4-4-volcanic-hazards" title="4.4 Volcanic Hazards"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">24</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">4.4 Volcanic Hazards</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>There are two classes of volcanic hazards, direct and indirect. Direct hazards are forces that directly kill or injure people, or destroy property or wildlife habitat. Indirect hazards are volcanism-induced environmental changes that lead to distress, famine, or habitat destruction. Indirect effects of volcanism have accounted for approximately 8 million deaths during historical times, while direct effects have accounted for fewer than 200,000, or 2.5% of the total. Some of the more important types of volcanic hazards are summarized in Table 4.2.</p> <table><caption>Table 4.2 A summary of the important volcanic hazards</caption> <tbody><tr><th><strong>Type</strong></th> <th><strong>Description</strong></th> <th><strong>Risk</strong></th> </tr> <tr><td>Tephra emissions</td> <td>Small particles of volcanic rock emitted into the atmosphere</td> <td>Respiration problems for some individuals <p>Significant climate cooling and famine</p> <p>Damage to aircraft</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>Gas emissions</td> <td>The emission of gases before, during, and after an eruption</td> <td>Climate cooling leading to crop failure and famine <p>In some cases, widespread poisoning</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyroclastic density current</td> <td>A very hot (several 100°C) mixture of gases and volcanic tephra that flows rapidly (up to 100s of km/h) down the side of a volcano</td> <td>Extreme hazard — destroys anything in the way</td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyroclastic fall</td> <td>Vertical fall of tephra in the area surrounding an eruption</td> <td>Thick tephra coverage of areas close to the eruption (km to 10s of km) <p>Collapsed roofs</p></td> </tr> <tr><td>Lahar</td> <td>A flow of mud and debris down a channel leading away from a volcano, triggered either by an eruption or a severe rain event</td> <td> Severe risk of destruction for anything within the channel — lahar mud flows can move at 10s of km/h</td> </tr> <tr><td>Sector collapse/ debris avalanche</td> <td>The failure of part of a volcano, either due to an eruption or for some other reason, leading to the failure of a large portion of the volcano</td> <td>Severe risk of destruction for anything in the path of the debris avalanche</td> </tr> <tr><td>Lava flow</td> <td>The flow of lava away from a volcanic vent</td> <td>People and infrastructure at risk, but lava flows tend to be slow (km/h) and are relatively easy to avoid</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h1><strong>Volcanic Gas and Tephra Emissions</strong></h1> <p>Large volumes of <strong>tephra</strong> (rock fragments, mostly <strong>pumice</strong>) and gases are emitted during major <strong>plinian</strong> <strong>eruptions</strong> (large explosive eruptions with hot gas a tephra columns extending into the stratosphere) at composite volcanoes, and a large volume of gas is released during some very high-volume effusive eruptions. One of the major effects is cooling of the climate by 1° to 2°C for several months to a few years because the dust particles and tiny droplets and particles of sulphur compounds block the sun. The last significant event of this type was in 1991 and 1992 following the large eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines. A drop of 1° to 2°C may not seem like very much, but that is the global average amount of cooling, and cooling was much more severe in some regions and at some times.</p> <p>Over an eight-month period in 1783 and 1784, a massive effusive eruption took place at the Laki volcano in Iceland. Although there was relatively little volcanic ash involved, a massive amount of sulphur dioxide was released into the atmosphere, along with a significant volume of hydrofluoric acid (HF). The sulphate <strong>aerosols </strong>that formed in the atmosphere led to dramatic cooling in the northern hemisphere. There were serious crop failures in Europe and North America, and a total of 6 million people are estimated to have died from famine and respiratory complications. In Iceland, poisoning from the HF resulted in the death of 80% of sheep, 50% of cattle, and the ensuing famine, along with HF poisoning, resulted in more than 10,000 human deaths, about 25% of the population.</p> <p>Volcanic ash can also have serious implications for aircraft because it can destroy jet engines. For example, over 5 million airline passengers had their travel disrupted by the 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruption in Iceland.</p> <p><strong>Pyroclastic Density Currents</strong></p> <p>In a typical explosive eruption at a composite volcano, the tephra and gases are ejected with explosive force and are hot enough to be forced high up into the atmosphere. As the eruption proceeds, and the amount of gas in the rising magma starts to decrease, parts will become heavier than air, and they can then flow downward along the flanks of the volcano (Figure 4.23). As they descend, they cool more and flow faster, reaching speeds up to several hundred km/h. A <strong>pyroclastic density current</strong> (PDC) consists of tephra ranging in size from boulders to microscopic shards of glass (made up of the edges and junctions of the bubbles of shattered pumice), plus gases (dominated by water vapour, but also including other gases). The temperature of this material can be as high as 1000°C. Among the most famous PDCs are the one that destroyed Pompeii in the year 79 CE, killing an estimated 18,000 people, and the one that destroyed the town of St. Pierre, Martinique, in 1902, killing an estimated 30,000.</p> <p>The buoyant upper parts of pyroclastic density currents can flow over water, in some cases for several kilometres. The 1902 St. Pierre PDC flowed out into the harbour and destroyed several wooden ships anchored there.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_319" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-319" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/eruption-of-Mt.-Mayon.jpg"><img class="wp-image-319" alt="Photograpy of the plinian eruption of Mt.

[USGS photo from: http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/73/Pyroclastic_flows_at_Mayon_Volcano.jpg]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><strong>Pyroclastic Fall</strong></h1> <p>Most of the tephra from an explosive eruption ascends high into the atmosphere, and some of it is distributed around Earth by high-altitude winds. The larger components (larger than 0.1 mm) tend to fall relatively close to the volcano, and the amount produced by large eruptions can cause serious damage and casualties. The large 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in the Philippines resulted in the accumulation of tens of centimetres of ash in fields and on rooftops in the surrounding populated region. Heavy typhoon rains that hit the island at the same time added to the weight of the tephra, leading to the collapse of thousands of roofs and to at least 300 of the 700 deaths attributed to the eruption.<strong><br /> </strong></p> <h1><strong>Lahar</strong></h1> <p>A <strong>lahar</strong> is any mudflow or <strong>debris flow</strong> that is related to a volcano. Most are caused by melting snow and ice during an eruption, as was the case with the lahar that destroyed the Colombian town of Armero in 1985 (described earlier). Lahars can also happen when there is no volcanic eruption, and one of the reasons is that, as we’ve seen, composite volcanoes tend to be weak and easily eroded.</p> <p>In October 1998, category 5 hurricane Mitch slammed into the coast of central America. Damage was extensive and 19,000 people died, not so much because of high winds but because of intense rainfall — some regions received almost 2 m of rain over a few days! Mudflows and debris flows occurred in many areas, especially in Honduras and Nicaragua. An example is Casita Volcano in Nicaragua, where the heavy rains weakened rock and volcanic debris on the upper slopes, resulting in a debris flow that rapidly built in volume as it raced down the steep slope, and then ripped through the towns of El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez killing more than 2,000 people (Figure 4.24). El Porvenir and Rolando Rodriguez were new towns that had been built without planning approval in an area that was known to be at risk of lahars.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_321" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-321" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/lahar-from-Casita-Volcano.jpg"><img class="wp-image-321" alt="Photograph of Part of the path of the lahar from Casita Volcano, October 30, 1998." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/lahar-from-Casita-Volcano.jpg" height="250" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-321">Figure 4.24 Part of the path of the lahar from Casita Volcano, October 30, 1998.

This hazard was first recognized with the failure of the north side of Mt. St. Helens immediately prior to the large eruption on May 18, 1980. In the weeks before the eruption, a large bulge had formed on the side of the volcano, the result of magma transfer from depth into a satellite magma body within the mountain itself. Early on the morning of May 18, a moderate earthquake struck nearby; this is thought to have destabilized the bulge, leading to Earth’s largest observed landslide in historical times. The failure of this part of the volcano exposed the underlying satellite magma chamber, causing it to explode sideways, which exposed the conduit leading to the magma chamber below. The resulting plinian eruption — with a 24 km high eruption column — lasted for nine hours.</p> <p>In August 2010, a massive part of the flank of B.C.’s Mt. Meager gave way and about 48 million cubic metres of rock rushed down the valley, one of the largest slope failures in Canada in historical times (Figure 4.25). More than 25 slope failures have taken place at Mt. Meager in the past 8,000 years, some of them more than 10 times larger than the 2010 failure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_323" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-323" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Mt.-Meager-rock-avalanche.png"><img class="wp-image-323" alt="Photograph with an arrow pointing at the top of the image to where the origin of the Mt.

They are as follows:</p> <ol><li><em>Gas leaks</em> — the release of gases (mostly H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, and SO<sub>2</sub>) from the magma into the atmosphere through cracks in the overlying rock</li> <li><em>Bit of a bulge</em> — the deformation of part of the volcano, indicating that a magma chamber at depth is swelling or becoming more pressurized</li> <li><em>Getting shaky</em> — many (hundreds to thousands) of small earthquakes, indicating that magma is on the move. The quakes may be the result of the magma forcing the surrounding rocks to crack, or a harmonic vibration that is evidence of magmatic fluids moving underground.</li> <li><em>Dropping fast</em> — a sudden decrease in the rate of seismicity, which may indicate that magma has stalled, which could mean that something is about to give way</li> <li><em>Big bump</em> — a pronounced bulge on the side of the volcano (like the one at Mt. St. Helens in 1980), which may indicate that magma has moved close to surface</li> <li><em>Blowing off steam</em> — steam eruptions (a.k.a. <strong>phreatic</strong> <strong>eruptions</strong>) that happen when magma near the surface heats groundwater to the boiling point. The water eventually explodes, sending fragments of the overlying rock far into the air.</li> </ol> <p>With these signs in mind, we can make a list of the equipment we should have and the actions we can take to monitor a volcano and predict when it might erupt.</p> <p><strong>Assessing seismicity:</strong> The simplest and cheapest way to monitor a volcano is with seismometers. In an area with several volcanoes that have the potential to erupt (e.g., the Squamish-Pemberton area), a few well-placed seismometers can provide us with an early warning that something is changing beneath one of the volcanoes, and that we need to take a closer look. There are currently enough seismometers in the Lower Mainland and on Vancouver Island to provide this information.<span class="footnote">See: http://www.earthquakescanada.nrcan.gc.ca/stndon/CNSN-RNSC/stnbook-cahierstn/index-eng.php?tpl_sorting=map&amp;CHIS_SZ=west</span></p> <p>If there is seismic evidence that a volcano is coming to life, more seismometers should be placed in locations within a few tens of kilometres of the source of the activity (Figure 4.26). This will allow geologists to determine the exact location and depth of the seismic activity so that they can see where the magma is moving.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-325" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/seismometer.jpg"><img class="wp-image-325" alt="Photograph of a seismometer installed in 2007 in the vicinity of the Nazco Cone, British Columbia" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/seismometer.jpg" height="224" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-325">Figure 4.26 A seismometer installed in 2007 in the vicinity of the Nazco Cone, B.C. [photo Cathie Hickson, used with permission]</div></div> <p><strong>Detecting gases:</strong> Water vapour quickly turns into clouds of liquid water droplets and is relatively easy to detect just by looking, but CO<sub>2</sub> and SO<sub>2</sub> are not as obvious. It’s important to be able to monitor changes in the composition of volcanic gases, and we need instruments to do that. Some can be monitored from a distance (from the ground or even from the air) using infrared devices, but to obtain more accurate data, we need to sample the air and do chemical analysis. This can be achieved with instruments placed on the ground close to the source of the gases (see Figure 4.17), or by collecting samples of the air and analyzing them in a lab.</p> <p><strong>Measuring deformation:</strong> There are two main ways to measure ground deformation at a volcano. One is known as a <strong>tiltmeter</strong>, which is a sensitive three-directional level that can sense small changes in the tilt of the ground at a specific location. Another is through the use of GPS (global positioning system) technology (Figure 4.27). GPS is more effective than a tiltmeter because it provides information on how far the ground has actually moved — east-west, north-south, and up-down.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_320" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-320" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Hualalai-volcano.jpg"><img class="wp-image-320" alt="Photograph of a GPS unit installed at Hualalai volcano, Hawaii" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Hualalai-volcano.jpg" height="333" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-320">Figure 4.27 A GPS unit installed at Hualalai volcano, Hawaii.

They can then make recommendations to authorities about the need for evacuations and restricting transportation corridors. Our ability to predict volcanic eruptions has increased dramatically in recent decades because of advances in our understanding of how volcanoes behave and in monitoring technology. Providing that careful work is done, there is no longer a large risk of surprise eruptions, and providing that public warnings are issued and heeded, it is less and less likely that thousands will die from sector collapse, pyroclastic flows, ash falls, or lahars. Indirect hazards are still very real, however, and we can expect the next eruption like the one at Laki in 1783 to take an even greater toll than it did then, especially since there are now roughly eight times as many people on Earth.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 4.6 Volcano Alert!</strong></p> <p>You’re the chief volcanologist for the Geological Survey of Canada (GSC), based in Vancouver.

In general, there has been a much lower rate and volume of volcanism in the B.C. part of this belt than in the U.S. part. One reason for this is that the northern part of the Juan de Fuca Plate (i.e., the Explorer Plate) is either not subducting, or is subducting at a slower rate than the rest of the plate. There are several volcanic centres in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt: the Garibaldi centre (including Mt. Garibaldi and the Black Tusk-Mt. Price area adjacent to Garibaldi Lake (Figures 4.1 and 4.2), Mt. Cayley, and Mt. Meager (Figure 4.25). The most recent volcanic activity in this area was at Mt. Meager. Approximately 2,400 years ago, an explosive eruption of about the same magnitude as the 1980 Mt. St. Helens eruption took place at Mt. Meager. Ash spread as far east as Alberta. There was also significant eruptive activity at Mts. Price and Garibaldi approximately 12,000 and 10,000 years ago during the last glaciation; in both cases, lava and tephra built up against glacial ice in the adjacent valley (Figure 4.29).

The North America Plate is moving in a westerly direction at about 2 cm per year with respect to this plume, and the series of now partly eroded shield volcanoes between Nazco and the coast is interpreted to have been formed by the plume as the continent moved over it.</p> <p>The Rainbow Range, which formed at approximately 8 Ma, is the largest of these older volcanoes. It has a diameter of about 30 km and an elevation of 2,495 m (Figure 4.30). The name “Rainbow” refers to the bright colours displayed by some of the volcanic rocks as they weather.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-903" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/rainbow.png"><img width="300" height="132" class="size-medium wp-image-903" alt="Figure 4.30 Rainbow Range, Chilcotin Plateau, B.C.

These are the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field southeast of Quesnel, and the Northern Cordillera Volcanic Field, which ranges across the northwestern corner of the province (as already discussed in section 4.1). This area includes Canada&#8217;s most recent volcanic eruption, a cinder cone and mafic lava flow that formed around 250 years ago at the Tseax River Cone in the Nass River area north of Terrace.  According to Nisga’a oral history, as many as 2,000 people died during that eruption, in which lava overran their village on the Nass River. Most of the deaths are attributed to asphyxiation from volcanic gases, probably carbon dioxide.</p> <p>The Mount Edziza Volcanic Field near the Stikine River is a large area of lava flows, sulphurous ridges, and cinder cones. The most recent eruption in this area was about 1,000 years ago. While most of the other volcanism in the Edziza region is mafic and involves lava flows and cinder cones, Mt. Edziza itself (Figure 4.31) is a composite volcano with rock compositions ranging from rhyolite to basalt. A possible explanation for the presence of composite volcanism in an area dominated by mafic flows and cinder cones is that there is a magma chamber beneath this area, within which magma differentiation is taking place.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_327" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-327" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Mount-Edziza.jpg"><img width="350" height="263" class="wp-image-327" alt="Photograph of Mount Edziza" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Mount-Edziza.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-327">Figure 4.31 Mount Edziza, in the Stikine area, B.C., with Eve Cone in the foreground.

Most volcanoes are associated with convergent plate boundaries (at subduction zones), and there is also a great deal of volcanic activity at divergent boundaries and areas of continental rifting. At convergent boundaries magma is formed where water from a subducting plate acts as a flux to lower the melting temperature of the adjacent mantle rock. At divergent boundaries magma forms because of decompression melting. Decompression melting also takes place within a mantle plume.</td> </tr> <tr><th>4.2</th> <th>Magma Composition and Eruption Style</th> <td>The initial magmas in most volcanic regions are mafic in composition, but they can evolve into more felsic types through interaction with crustal rock, and as a result of crystal settling within a magma chamber. Felsic magmas tend to have higher gas contents than mafic magmas, and they are also more viscous. The higher viscosity prevents gases from escaping from the magma, and so felsic magmas are more pressurized and more likely to erupt explosively.</td> </tr> <tr><th>4.3</th> <th>Types of Volcanoes</th> <td>Cinder cones, which can form in various volcanic settings, are relatively small volcanoes that are composed mostly of mafic rock fragments that were formed during a single eruptive event.   Composite volcanoes are normally associated with subduction, and while their magma tends to be intermediate on average, it can range all the way from felsic to mafic. The corresponding differences in magma viscosity lead to significant differences in eruptions style. Most shield volcanoes are associated with mantle plumes, and have consistently mafic magma which generally erupts as lava flows.</td> </tr> <tr><th>4.4</th> <th>Volcanic Hazards</th> <td>Most direct volcanic hazards are related to volcanoes that erupt explosively, especially composite volcanoes. Pyroclastic density currents, some as hot as 1000˚C can move at hundreds of km/h and will kill anything in the way. Lahars, volcano-related mudflows, can be large enough to destroy entire towns.  Lava flows will destroy anything in their paths, but tend to move slowly enough so that people can get to safety.</td> </tr> <tr><th>4.5</th> <th>Monitoring Volcanoes and Predicting Eruptions</th> <td>We have the understanding and technology to predict volcanic eruptions with some success, and to ensure that people are not harmed. The prediction techniques include monitoring seismicity in volcanic regions, detecting volcanic gases, and measuring deformation of the flanks of a volcano.</td> </tr> <tr><th>4.6</th> <th>Volcanoes in British Columbia</th> <td>There are examples of all of the important types of volcanoes in British Columbia, including subduction volcanism north of Vancouver, mantle-plume volcanism along the Nazco trend, and rift-related volcanism in the Wells Gray and Stikine regions.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions fo Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>What are the three main tectonic settings for volcanism on Earth?</li> <li>What is the primary mechanism for partial melting at a convergent plate boundary?</li> <li>Why are the viscosity and gas content of a magma important in determining the type of volcanic rocks that will be formed when that magma is extruded?</li> <li>Why do the gases in magma not form gas bubbles when the magma is deep within the crust?</li> <li>Where do pillow lavas form?

With the exception of volcanic rocks and some sedimentary rocks, most rocks are formed at some depth within the crust. There they experience relatively constant temperature, high pressure, no contact with the atmosphere, and little or no moving water. Once a rock is exposed at the surface, which is what happens when the overlying rock is eroded away, conditions change dramatically. Temperatures vary widely, there is much less pressure, oxygen and other gases are plentiful, and in most climates, water is abundant (Figure 5.1).</p> <p>Weathering includes two main processes that are quite different. One is the mechanical breakdown of rock into smaller fragments, and the other is the chemical change of the minerals within the rock to forms that are stable in the surface environment. Mechanical weathering provides fresh surfaces for attack by chemical processes, and chemical weathering weakens the rock so that it is more susceptible to mechanical weathering. Together, these processes create two very important products, one being the sedimentary clasts and ions in solution that can eventually become sedimentary rock, and the other being the soil that is necessary for our existence on Earth.</p> <p>The various processes related to uplift and weathering are summarized in the rock cycle in Figure 5.2.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_352" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-352" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image003.png"><img class="wp-image-352" alt="The Rock Cycle." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image003-1024x753.png" width="400" height="294" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-352">Figure 5.2 Weathering can take place once a rock is exposed at surface by uplift and the removal of the overlying rock.

Sedimentary and metamorphic rocks, on the other hand, tend to exfoliate along predetermined planes (Figure 5.4).</p> <p><strong>Frost wedging</strong> is the process by which water seeps into cracks in a rock, expands on freezing, and thus enlarges the cracks (Figure 5.5). The effectiveness of frost wedging is related to the frequency of freezing and thawing. Frost wedging is most effective in a climate like Canada’s. In warm areas where freezing is infrequent, in very cold areas where thawing is infrequent, or in very dry areas, where there is little water to seep into cracks, the role of frost wedging is limited.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-355" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image009.png"><img width="300" height="297" class="wp-image-355" alt="The process of frost wedging on a steep slope.

Even in warm coastal areas of southern B.C., freezing and thawing transitions are common at higher elevations. A common feature in areas of effective frost wedging is a <strong>talus slope</strong> — a fan-shaped deposit of fragments removed by frost wedging from the steep rocky slopes above (Figure 5.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-356" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image011.jpg"><img width="400" height="273" class="wp-image-356" alt="Photograph of an area with very effective frost-wedging near to Keremeos, BC.

In this case, water in the soil freezes and expands, pushing the overlying material up. Frost heaving is responsible for winter damage to roads all over North America.</p> <p>When salt water seeps into rocks and then evaporates on a hot sunny day, salt crystals grow within cracks and pores in the rock. The growth of these crystals exerts pressure on the rock and can push grains apart, causing the rock to weaken and break. There are many examples of this on the rocky shorelines of Vancouver Island and the Gulf Islands, where sandstone outcrops are common and salty seawater is readily available (Figure 5.7). Salt weathering can also occur away from the coast, because most environments have some salt in them.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_357" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-357" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image013.jpg"><img width="400" height="179" class="wp-image-357" alt="Photograph of Honeycomb weathering of sandstone on Gabriola Island, BC.

Roots can force their way into even the tiniest cracks, and then they exert tremendous pressure on the rocks as they grow, widening the cracks and breaking the rock (Figure 5.8).

A good example of this is shown in Figure 5.6. On the steep rock faces at the top of the cliff, rock fragments have been broken off by ice wedging, and then removed by gravity. This is a form of mass wasting, which is discussed in more detail in Chapter 15. Other important agents of erosion that also have the effect of removing the products of weathering include water in streams (Chapter 13), ice in glaciers (Chapter 16), and waves on the coasts (Chapter 17).</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 5.1 Mechanical Weathering</strong></p> <p>This photo shows granitic rock at the top of Stawamus Chief near Squamish, B.C.

The kinds of changes that take place are highly specific to the mineral and the environmental conditions. Some minerals, like quartz, are virtually unaffected by chemical weathering, while others, like feldspar, are easily altered. In general, the degree of chemical weathering is greatest in warm and wet climates, and least in cold and dry climates. The important characteristics of surface conditions that lead to chemical weathering are the presence of water (in the air and on the ground surface), the abundance of oxygen, and the presence of carbon dioxide, which produces weak carbonic acid when combined with water. That process, which is fundamental to most chemical weathering, can be shown as follows:</p> <p>H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2 </sub>&#8212;-&gt;H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3    </sub> then   H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>&#8212;-&gt; H<sup>+</sup>     + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>,</p> <p>water + carbon dioxide &#8212;-&gt; carbonic acid   then    carbonic acid  &#8212;-&gt; hydrgen ion + carbonate ion</p> <p>Here we have water (e.g., as rain) plus carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, combining to create carbonic acid. Then carbonic acid dissociates (comes apart) to form hydrogen and carbonate ions. The amount of CO<sub>2</sub> in the air is enough to make only very weak carbonic acid, but there is typically much more CO<sub>2</sub> in the soil, so water that percolates through the soil can become significantly more acidic.</p> <p>There are two main types of chemical weathering. On the one hand, some minerals become altered to other minerals. For example, feldspar is altered — by <strong>hydrolysis </strong>— to <strong>clay minerals</strong>. On the other hand, some minerals dissolve completely, and their components go into solution. For example, calcite (CaCO<sub>3</sub>) is soluble in acidic solutions.</p> <p>The hydrolysis of feldspar can be written like this:</p> <p>CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8  </sub>+ H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>  + ½O<sub>2</sub> &#8212;-&gt; Al<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4 </sub>+<sub>   </sub>Ca<sup>2+</sup> +  CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup></p> <p>plagioclase + carbonic acid &#8212;-&gt; kaolinite + dissolved calcium + carbonate ions</p> <p>This reaction shows calcium plagioclase feldspar, but similar reactions could also be written for sodium or potassium feldspars. In this case, we end up with the mineral kaolinite, along with calcium and carbonate ions in solution. Those ions can eventually combine (probably in the ocean) to form the mineral calcite. The hydrolysis of feldspar to clay is illustrated in Figure 5.9, which shows two images of the same granitic rock, a recently broken fresh surface on the left and a clay-altered weathered surface on the right. Other silicate minerals can also go through hydrolysis, although the end results will be a little different. For example, pyroxene can be converted to the clay minerals chlorite or smectite, and olivine can be converted to the clay mineral serpentine.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_360" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-360" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/granitic-rock.png"><img width="400" height="192" class="wp-image-360" alt="granitic rock" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/granitic-rock.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-360">Figure 5.9 Unweathered (left) and weathered (right) surfaces of the same piece of granitic rock.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Oxidation</strong> is another very important chemical weathering process. The oxidation of the iron in a ferromagnesian silicate starts with the dissolution of the iron. For olivine, the process looks like this, where olivine in the presence of carbonic acid is converted to dissolved iron, carbonate, and silicic acid:</p> <p>Fe<sub>2</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>+ 4H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3 </sub>&#8212;&gt; 2Fe<sup><sub>2</sub>+</sup>   +  4HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>       +  H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub></p> <p>olivine + (carbonic acid) &#8212;&gt; dissolved iron + dissolved carbonate + dissolved silicic acid</p> <p>In the presence of oxygen, the dissolved iron is then quickly converted to hematite:</p> <p>2Fe<sup><sub>2</sub>+</sup>  + 4HCO<sub>3</sub>&#8211; + ½ O<sub>2</sub>     +  2H<sub>2</sub>O &#8212;-&gt;Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3   </sub>+ 4H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub></p> <p>dissolved iron + bicarbonate + oxygen + water&#8212;-&gt;hematite + carbonic acid</p> <p>The equation shown here is for olivine, but it could apply to almost any other ferromagnesian silicate, including pyroxene, amphibole, or biotite. Iron in the sulphide minerals (e.g., pyrite) can also be oxidized in this way. And the mineral hematite is not the only possible end result, as there is a wide range of iron oxide minerals that can form in this way. The results of this process are illustrated in Figure 5.10, which shows a granitic rock in which some of the biotite and amphibole have been altered to form the iron oxide mineral limonite.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-361" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image023.jpg"><img width="400" height="319" class="wp-image-361" alt="image023" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image023.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-361">Figure 5.10 A granitic rock containing biotite and amphibole which have been altered near to the rock’s surface to limonite, which is a mixture of iron oxide minerals. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A special type of oxidation takes place in areas where the rocks have elevated levels of sulphide minerals, especially pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>). Pyrite reacts with water and oxygen to form sulphuric acid, as follows:</p> <p>2FeS<sub>2  </sub>+ 7O<sub>2</sub> +2H<sub>2</sub>O &#8212;&#8211;&gt; 2Fe<sup>2+</sup>   H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>+ 2H<sup>+</sup></p> <p>pyrite + oxygen + water &#8212;&#8211;&gt; iron ions + sulphuric acid + hydrogen ions</p> <p>The runoff from areas where this process is taking place is known as <strong>acid rock drainage</strong> (ARD), and even a rock with 1% or 2% pyrite can produce significant ARD. Some of the worst examples of ARD are at metal mine sites, especially where pyrite-bearing rock and waste material have been mined from deep underground and then piled up and left exposed to water and oxygen. One example of that is the Mt. Washington Mine near Courtenay on Vancouver Island (Figure 5.11), but there are many similar sites across Canada and around the world.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Mt.-Washington-Mine.png"><img width="400" height="166" class="wp-image-362" alt="Mt.

Washington Mine, B.C. (left), and an example of acid drainage downstream from the mine site (right). [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At many ARD sites, the pH of the runoff water is less than 4 (very acidic). Under these conditions, metals such as copper, zinc, and lead are quite soluble, which can lead to toxicity for aquatic and other organisms. For many years, the river downstream from the Mt. Washington Mine had so much dissolved copper in it that it was toxic to salmon. Remediation work has since been carried out at the mine and the situation has improved.</p> <p>The hydrolysis of feldspar and other silicate minerals and the oxidation of iron in ferromagnesian silicates all serve to create rocks that are softer and weaker than they were to begin with, and thus more susceptible to mechanical weathering.</p> <p>The weathering reactions that we’ve discussed so far involved the transformation of one mineral to another mineral (e.g., feldspar to clay), and the release of some ions in solution (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>). Some weathering processes involve the complete dissolution of a mineral. Calcite, for example, will dissolve in weak acid, to produce calcium and bicarbonate ions. The equation is as follows:</p> <p>CaCO<sub>3</sub>  + H<sup>+</sup>   + HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup>  &#8212;&#8211;&gt;   Ca<sup>2+</sup>  + 2HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>&#8211;</sup></p> <p>calcite + hydrogen ions + bicarbonate &#8212;&#8211;&gt;  calcium ions + bicarbonate</p> <p>Calcite is the major component of limestone (typically more than 95%), and under surface conditions, limestone will dissolve to varying degrees (depending on which minerals it contains, other than calcite), as shown in Figure 5.12. Limestone also dissolves at relatively shallow depths underground, forming limestone caves. This is discussed in more detail in Chapter 14, where we look at <strong>groundwater</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_363" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-363" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image029.jpg"><img width="400" height="387" class="wp-image-363" alt="image029" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image029.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-363">Figure 5.12 A limestone outcrop on Quadra Island, B.C.

The nature of these materials — their composition, size, degree of sorting, and degree of rounding — is determined by the type of rock that is being weathered, the nature of the weathering, the erosion and transportation processes, and the climate.</p> <p>A summary of the weathering products of some of the common minerals present in rocks is provided in Table 5.1.</p> <table><caption>Table 5.1 A list of the typical weathering products of some of the minerals in common rocks [SE]</caption> <tbody><tr><th><strong>Common Mineral</strong></th> <th><strong>Typical Weathering Products</strong></th> </tr> <tr><td>Quartz</td> <td>Quartz as sand grains</td> </tr> <tr><td>Feldspar</td> <td>Clay minerals plus potassium, sodium, and calcium in solution</td> </tr> <tr><td>Biotite and amphibole</td> <td>Chlorite plus iron and magnesium in solution</td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyroxene and olivine</td> <td>Serpentine plus iron and magnesium in solution</td> </tr> <tr><td>Calcite</td> <td>Calcium and carbonate in solution</td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyrite</td> <td>Iron oxide minerals plus iron in solution and sulphuric acid</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Some examples of the products of weathering are shown in Figure 5.13. They range widely in size and shape depending on the processes involved. If and when deposits like these are turned into sedimentary rocks, the textures of those rocks will vary significantly. Importantly, when we describe sedimentary rocks that formed millions of years in the past, we can use those properties to make inferences about the conditions that existed during their formation.</p> <p>We’ll talk more about the nature and interpretation of sediments and sedimentary rocks in Chapter 6, but it’s worth considering here why the sandy sediments shown in Figure 5.13 are so strongly dominated by the mineral quartz, even though quartz makes up less than 20% of Earth’s crust. The explanation is that quartz is highly resistant to the types of weathering that occur at Earth’s surface. It is not affected by weak acids or the presence of oxygen. This makes it unique among the minerals that are common in igneous rocks. Quartz is also very hard, and doesn’t have cleavage, so it is resistant to mechanical erosion.</p> <p>As weathering proceeds, the ferromagnesian silicates and feldspar are very likely to be broken into small pieces and converted into clay minerals and dissolved ions (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, Fe<sup>2+</sup>, Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and H<sub>4</sub>SiO<sub>4</sub>). In other words, quartz, clay minerals, and dissolved ions are the most common products of weathering. Quartz and some of the clay minerals tend to form sedimentary deposits on and at the edges of continents, while the rest of the clay minerals and the dissolved ions tend to be washed out into the oceans to form sediments on the sea floor.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-921" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/clasts-3.png"><img width="300" height="261" class="size-medium wp-image-921" alt="Figure 5.13 Products of weathering and erosion formed under different conditions.

In other words, we owe our existence to weathering, and we need to take care of our soil!</p> <p>Many people refer to any loose material on Earth’s surface as soil, but to geologists (and geology students) soil is the material that includes organic matter, lies within the top few tens of centimetres of the surface, and is important in sustaining plant growth.</p> <p>Soil is a complex mixture of minerals (approximately 45%), organic matter (approximately 5%), and empty space (approximately 50%, filled to varying degrees with air and water). The mineral content of soils is variable, but is dominated by clay minerals and quartz, along with minor amounts of feldspar and small fragments of rock. The types of weathering that take place within a region have a major influence on soil composition and texture. For example, in a warm climate, where chemical weathering dominates, soils tend to be richer in clay. Soil scientists describe soil texture in terms of the relative proportions of sand, silt, and clay, as shown in Figure 5.14. The sand and silt components in this diagram are dominated by quartz, with lesser amounts of feldspar and rock fragments, while the clay component is dominated by the clay minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-368" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image045.png"><img class="wp-image-368" alt="The sand and silt components in this diagram are dominated by quartz, with lesser amounts of feldspar and rock fragments, while the clay component is dominated by the clay minerals." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image045.png" height="383" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-368">Figure 5.14 The U.S. Department of Agriculture soil texture diagram.

The factors that affect the nature of soil and the rate of its formation include climate (especially average temperature and precipitation amounts, and the consequent types of vegetation), the type of parent material, the slope of the surface, and the amount of time available.</p> <h1><strong>Climate</strong></h1> <p>Soils develop because of the weathering of materials on Earth’s surface, including the mechanical breakup of rocks, and the chemical weathering of minerals. Soil development is facilitated by the downward percolation of water. Soil forms most readily under temperate to tropical conditions (not cold) and where precipitation amounts are moderate (not dry, but not too wet). Chemical weathering reactions (especially the formation of clay minerals) and biochemical reactions proceed fastest under warm conditions, and plant growth is enhanced in warm climates. Too much water (e.g., in rainforests) can lead to the leaching of important chemical nutrients and hence to acidic soils. In humid and poorly drained regions, swampy conditions may prevail, producing soil that is dominated by organic matter. Too little water (e.g., in deserts and semi-deserts), results in very limited downward chemical transportation and the accumulation of salts and carbonate minerals (e.g., calcite) from upward-moving water. Soils in dry regions also suffer from a lack of organic material (Figure 5.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-369" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image047.jpg"><img class="wp-image-369" alt="Photograph of Poorly developed soil on wind-blown silt (loess) in an arid part of northeastern Washington State." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image047.jpg" height="422" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-369">Figure 5.15 Poorly developed soil on wind-blown silt (loess) in an arid part of northeastern Washington State [SE]</div></div> <h1><strong><br /> Parent Material</strong></h1> <p>Soil parent materials can include all different types of bedrock and any type of unconsolidated sediments, such as glacial deposits and stream deposits. Soils are described as <strong>residual soils</strong> if they develop on bedrock, and transported soils if they develop on transported material such as glacial sediments. But the term “transported soil” is misleading because it implies that the soil itself has been transported, which is not the case. When referring to such soil, it is better to be specific and say “soil developed on unconsolidated material,” because that distinguishes it from soil developed on bedrock.</p> <p>Quartz-rich parent material, such as granite, sandstone, or loose sand, leads to the development of sandy soils. Quartz-poor material, such as shale or basalt, generates soils with little sand.</p> <p>Parent materials provide important nutrients to residual soils. For example, a minor constituent of granitic rocks is the calcium-phosphate mineral apatite, which is a source of the important soil nutrient phosphorus. Basaltic parent material tends to generate very fertile soils because it also provides phosphorus, along with significant amounts of iron, magnesium, and calcium.</p> <p>Some unconsolidated materials, such as river-flood deposits, make for especially good soils because they tend to be rich in clay minerals. Clay minerals have large surface areas with negative charges that are attractive to positively charged elements like calcium, magnesium, iron, and potassium — important nutrients for plant growth.</p> <h1><strong>Slope</strong></h1> <p>Soil can only develop where surface materials remain in place and are not frequently moved away by mass wasting. Soils cannot develop where the rate of soil formation is less than the rate of erosion, so steep slopes tend to have little or no soil.</p> <h1><strong>Time</strong></h1> <p>Even under ideal conditions, soil takes thousands of years to develop. Virtually all of southern Canada was still glaciated up until 14 ka, and most of the central and northern parts of B.C., the prairies, Ontario, and Quebec were still glaciated at 12 ka. Glaciers still dominated the central and northern parts of Canada until around 10 ka, and so, at that time, conditions were still not ideal for soil development even in the southern regions. Therefore, soils in Canada, and especially in central and northern Canada, are relatively young and not well developed.</p> <p>The same applies to soils that are forming on newly created surfaces, such as recent deltas or sand bars, or in areas of mass wasting.</p> <h1><strong>Soil Horizons</strong></h1> <p>The process of soil formation generally involves the downward movement of clay, water, and dissolved ions, and a common result of that is the development of chemically and texturally different layers known as <strong>soil horizons</strong>. The typically developed soil horizons, as illustrated in Figure 5.16, are:</p> <p>O — the layer of organic matter</p> <p>A — the layer of partially decayed organic matter mixed with mineral material</p> <p>E— the eluviated (leached) layer from which some of the clay and iron have been removed to create a pale layer that may be sandier than the other layers</p> <p>B — the layer of accumulation of clay, iron, and other elements from the overlying soil</p> <p>C — the layer of incomplete weathering</p> <p>Although rare in Canada, another type of layer that develops in hot arid regions is known as <strong>caliche</strong> (pronounced <em>ca-lee-chee</em>). It forms from the downward (or in some cases upward) movement of calcium ions, and the precipitation of calcite within the soil. When well developed, caliche cements the surrounding material together to form a layer that has the consistency of concrete.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-370" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image049.png"><img class="wp-image-370" alt="Soil horizons in a podsol from a site in northeastern Scotland.

Human practices related to forestry and agriculture have significantly upset this balance.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Soils are held in place by vegetation. When vegetation is removed, either through cutting trees or routinely harvesting crops and tilling the soil, that protection is either temporarily or permanently lost. The primary agents of the erosion of unprotected soil are water and wind.</p> <p>Water erosion is accentuated on sloped surfaces because fast-flowing water obviously has greater eroding power than still water (Figure 5.17). Raindrops can disaggregate exposed soil particles, putting the finer material (e.g., clays) into suspension in the water. <strong>Sheetwash</strong>, unchannelled flow across a surface carries suspended material away, and channels erode right through the soil layer, removing both fine and coarse material.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-371" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image051.jpg"><img class="wp-image-371" alt="Soil erosion by rain and channelled runoff on a field in Alberta." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image051.jpg" height="265" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-371">Figure 5.17 Soil erosion by rain and channelled runoff on a field in Alberta.

However, it was long recognized that the U.S .system did not apply well to many parts of Canada because of climate and environmental differences. The Canadian System of Soil Classification was first outlined in 1955 and has been refined and modified numerous times since then.</p> <p>There are 10 orders of soil recognized in Canada. Each one is divided into groups, and then families, and then series, but we will only look at the orders, some of which are summarized in Table 5.2. The distribution of these types of soils (and a few others) in Canada is shown in Figure 5.19.</p> <table style="height: 274px;"><caption>Table 5.2 The nature, origins and distributions of the more important soil orders in Canada</caption> <tbody><tr style="height: 14px;"><th style="height: 14px; width: 78.0625px;"><strong>Order</strong></th> <th style="height: 14px; width: 355.062px;"><strong>Brief Description</strong></th> <th style="height: 14px; width: 440.062px;"><strong>Environment</strong></th> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><th style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;"><strong>Forest soils</strong></th> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14px;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 78.0625px;">Podsol</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 355.062px;">Well-developed A and B horizons</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 440.062px;">Coniferous forests throughout Canada</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14px;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 78.0625px;">Luvisol</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 355.062px;">Clay rich B horizon</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 440.062px;">Northern prairies and central B.C., mostly on sedimentary rocks</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><td style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;">Brunisol</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;">Poorly developed or immature soil, that does not have the well-defined horizons of podsol or luvisol</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;">Boreal-forest soils in the discontinuous permafrost areas of central and western Canada, and also in southern B.C.</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><th style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;"><strong>Grassland soils</strong></th> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><td style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;">Chernozem</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;">High levels of organic matter and an A horizon at least 10 cm thick</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;">Southern prairies (and parts of B.C.’s southern interior), in areas that experience water deficits during the summer</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><td style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;">Solonetzic</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;">A clay-rich B horizon, commonly with a salt-bearing C horizon</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;">Southern prairies, in areas that experience water deficits during the summer</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 44px;"><th style="height: 44px; width: 78.0625px;"><strong>Other important soils</strong></th> <td style="height: 44px; width: 355.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 44px; width: 440.062px;"></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><td style="height: 29px; width: 78.0625px;">Organic</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 355.062px;">Dominated by organic matter; mineral horizons are typically absent</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 440.062px;">Wetland areas, especially along the western edge of Hudson Bay, and in the area between the prairies and the boreal forest</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 14px;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 78.0625px;">Cryosol</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 355.062px;">Poorly developed soil, mostly C horizon</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 440.062px;">Permafrost areas of northern Canada</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>There is an excellent website on Canadian soils, with videos describing the origins and characteristics of the soils, at: <a href="http://soilweb.landfood.ubc.ca/classification/">http://soilweb.landfood.ubc.ca/classification/</a>.</p> <p>As we’ve discussed, the processes of soil formation are dominated by the downward transportation of clays and certain elements, and the nature of those processes depends in large part on the climate. In Canada’s predominantly cool and humid climate (which applies to most places other than the far north), <strong>podsolization</strong> is the norm.

One is the biological one, wherein living organisms — mostly plants — consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to make their tissues, and then, after they die, that carbon is released back into the atmosphere when they decay over a period of years or decades. A small proportion of this biological-cycle carbon becomes buried in sedimentary rocks: during the slow formation of coal, as tiny fragments and molecules in organic-rich shale, and as the shells and other parts of marine organisms in limestone. This then becomes part of the geological carbon cycle, a cycle that actually involves a majority of Earth’s carbon, but one that operates only very slowly.</p> <p>The geological carbon cycle is shown diagrammatically in Figure 5.20. The various steps in the process (not necessarily in this order) are as follows:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>a:</strong></td> <td>Organic matter from plants is stored in peat, coal, and permafrost for thousands to millions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>b:</strong></td> <td>Weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, which is stored in the oceans for thousands to tens of thousands of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>c:</strong></td> <td>Dissolved carbon is converted by marine organisms to calcite, which is stored in carbonate rocks for tens to hundreds of millions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>d:</strong></td> <td>Carbon compounds are stored in sediments for tens to hundreds of millions of years; some end up in petroleum deposits.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>e:</strong></td> <td>Carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to the mantle, where the carbon may be stored for tens of millions to billions of years.</td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>f:</strong></td> <td>During volcanic eruptions, carbon dioxide is released back to the atmosphere, where it is stored for years to decades.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-374" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image057.png"><img class="wp-image-374" alt="A representation of the geological carbon cycle (a: carbon in organic matter stored in peat, coal and permafrost, b: weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, c: dissolved carbon is converted to calcite by marine organisms, d: carbon compounds are stored in sediments, e: carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to longer-term storage in the mantle, and f: carbon dioxide is released back to atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.)" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image057.png" height="126" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-374">Figure 5.20 A representation of the geological carbon cycle (a: carbon in organic matter stored in peat, coal and permafrost, b: weathering of silicate minerals converts atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, c: dissolved carbon is converted to calcite by marine organisms, d: carbon compounds are stored in sediments, e: carbon-bearing sediments are transferred to longer-term storage in the mantle, and f: carbon dioxide is released back to atmosphere during volcanic eruptions.) [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>During much of Earth’s history, the geological carbon cycle has been balanced, with carbon being released by volcanism at approximately the same rate that it is stored by the other processes. Under these conditions, the climate remains relatively stable.</p> <p>During some periods of Earth’s history, that balance has been upset. This can happen during prolonged periods of greater than average volcanism. One example is the eruption of the Siberian Traps at around 250 Ma, which appears to have led to strong climate warming over a few million years.</p> <p>A carbon imbalance is also associated with significant mountain-building events. For example, the Himalayan Range was formed between about 40 and 10 Ma and over that time period — and still today — the rate of weathering on Earth has been enhanced because those mountains are so high and the range is so extensive. The weathering of these rocks — most importantly the hydrolysis of feldspar — has resulted in consumption of atmospheric carbon dioxide and transfer of the carbon to the oceans and to ocean-floor carbonate minerals. The steady drop in carbon dioxide levels over the past 40 million years, which led to the Pleistocene glaciations, is partly attributable to the formation of the Himalayan Range.</p> <p>Another, non-geological form of carbon-cycle imbalance is happening today on a very rapid time scale. We are in the process of extracting vast volumes of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas) that was stored in rocks over the past several hundred million years, and converting these fuels to energy and carbon dioxide. By doing so, we are changing the climate faster than has ever happened in the past.</p> </div></div>

The remaining steps in the formation of sedimentary rocks are transportation, deposition, burial, and lithification (Figure 6.2). Transportation is the movement of sediments or dissolved ions from the site of erosion to a site of deposition; this can be by wind, flowing water, glacial ice, or mass movement down a slope. Deposition takes place where the conditions change enough so that sediments being transported can no longer be transported (e.g., a current slows). Burial occurs when more sediments are piled onto existing sediments, and layers formed earlier are covered and compacted. Lithification is what happens — at depths of hundreds to thousands of metres — when those compacted sediments become cemented together to form solid sedimentary rock.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_79" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/The-rock-cycle.png"><img class="wp-image-79" alt="Figure 6.2 The rock cycle, showing the processes related to sedimentary rocks on the right-hand side." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/The-rock-cycle.png" width="400" height="296" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-79">Figure 6.2 The rock cycle, showing the processes related to sedimentary rocks on the right-hand side.</div></div> <p>In this textbook, we divide sedimentary rocks into two main types: <strong>clastic</strong> and <strong>chemical</strong>. Clastic sedimentary rocks are mainly composed of material that has been transported as solid fragments (clasts). Chemical sedimentary rocks are mainly composed of material that has been transported as ions in solution. It’s important <em>not </em>to assume that mechanical weathering leads only to clastic sedimentary rocks, while chemical weathering leads only to chemical sedimentary rocks. In most cases, millions of years separate the weathering and depositional processes, and both types of sedimentary rocks tend to include at least some material derived from both types of weathering.</p></div>

The smaller ones tend to be composed of a single mineral crystal, and the larger ones are typically composed of pieces of rock. As we’ve seen in Chapter 5, most sand-sized clasts are made of quartz because quartz is more resistant to weathering than any other common mineral. Most clasts that are smaller than sand size (&lt;1/16 mm) are made of clay minerals.

The diameter limits for each successive subcategory are twice as large as the one beneath it. In general, a <strong>boulder</strong> is bigger than a toaster and difficult to lift. There is no upper limit to the size of boulder.<span class="footnote">The largest known free-standing rock (i.e., not part of bedrock) is Giant Rock in the Mojave Desert, California.

A <strong>pebble</strong> is something that you could throw quite easily. The smaller ones — known as <strong>granules </strong>— are gravel size, but still you could throw one. But you can’t really throw a single grain of <strong>sand</strong>. Sand ranges from 2 mm down to 0.063 mm, and its key characteristic is that it feels “sandy” or gritty between your fingers — even the finest sand grains feel that way. <strong>Silt</strong> is essentially too small for individual grains to be visible, and while sand feels sandy to your fingers, silt feels smooth to your fingers but gritty in your mouth. Clay is so fine that it feels smooth even in your mouth.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 6.1 Describe the Sediment on a Beach</strong></p> <p>Providing that your landscape isn’t covered in deep snow at present, visit a beach somewhere nearby — an ocean shore, a lakeshore, or a bar on a river — and look carefully at the size and shape of the beach sediments. Are they sand, pebbles, or cobbles? If they are not too fine, you should be able to tell if they are well rounded or more angular.</p> <p>The beach in the image is at Sechelt, B.C. Although there is a range of clast sizes, it’s mostly made up of well-rounded cobbles, interspersed with pebbles. This beach is subject to strong wave activity, especially when winds blow across the Strait of Georgia from the south. That explains why the clasts are relatively large and are well rounded.</p> <p><strong><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/sediment.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-82 alignnone" alt="sediment" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/sediment-241x300.png" width="241" height="300" /></a></strong></p> </div> </div> <p>If you drop a granule into a glass of water, it will sink quickly to the bottom (less than half a second). If you drop a grain of sand into the same glass, it will sink more slowly (a second or two depending on the size). A grain of silt will take several seconds to get to the bottom, and a particle of fine clay may never get there. The rate of settling is determined by the balance between gravity and friction, as shown in Figure 6.3.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_84" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-84" style="width: 225px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/grain.png"><img class="wp-image-84 size-medium" alt="grain" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/grain-225x300.png" width="225" height="300" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-84">Figure 6.3 The two forces operating on a grain of sand in water. Gravity is pushing it down, and the friction between the grain and the water is resisting that downward force. Large particles settle quickly because the gravitational force (which is proportional to the mass, and therefore to the volume of the particle) is much greater than the frictional force (which is proportional to the surface area of the particle). For small particles it is only slightly greater, so they settle slowly.</div></div> <div><h1><strong>Transportation</strong></h1> <p>One of the key principles of sedimentary geology is that the ability of a moving medium (air or water) to move sedimentary particles, and keep them moving, is dependent on the velocity of flow. The faster the medium flows, the larger the particles it can move. This is illustrated in Figure 6.4. Parts of the river are moving faster than other parts, especially where the slope is greatest and the channel is narrow. Not only does the velocity of a river change from place to place, but it changes from season to season.</p> <p>During peak <strong>discharge</strong><span class="footnote">Discharge of a stream is the volume of flow passing a point per unit time. It’s normally measured in cubic metres per second (m3/s).</span> at this location, the water is high enough to flow over the embankment on the right, and it flows fast enough to move the boulders that cannot be moved during low flows.</p> <div><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Englishman-River.png"><img class="wp-image-85" alt="Figure 6.4 Variations in flow velocity on the Englishman River near to Parksville, B.C.

Large <strong>bedload</strong> clasts are pushed (by traction) or bounced along the bottom (saltation), while smaller clasts are suspended in the water and kept there by the turbulence of the flow. As the flow velocity changes, different-sized clasts may be either incorporated into the flow or deposited on the bottom. At various places along a river, there are always some clasts being deposited, some staying where they are, and some being eroded and transported. This changes over time as the discharge of the river changes in response to changing weather conditions.</p> <p>Other sediment transportation media, such as waves, ocean currents, and wind, operate under similar principles, with flow velocity as the key underlying factor that controls transportation and deposition.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_86" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-86" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/sediment-clasts.png"><img class="wp-image-86" alt="Figure 6.5 Transportation of sediment clasts by stream flow.

Depending on the grain size in particular, they may eventually form into rocks ranging from fine mudstone to coarse breccia and conglomerate.</p> <p><strong>Lithification</strong> is the term used to describe a number of different processes that take place within a deposit of sediment to turn it into solid rock. One of these processes is burial by other sediments, which leads to compaction of the material and removal of some of the intervening water and air. After this stage, the individual clasts are all touching one another. <strong>Cementation</strong> is the process of crystallization of minerals within the pores between the small clasts, and also at the points of contact between the larger clasts (sand size and larger). Depending on the pressure, temperature, and chemical conditions, these crystals might include calcite, hematite, quartz, clay minerals, or a range of other minerals.</p> <p>The characteristics and distinguishing features of clastic sedimentary rocks are summarized in Table 6.2. <strong>Mudrock</strong> is composed of at least 75% silt- and clay-sized fragments. If it is dominated by clay, it is called <strong>claystone</strong>. If it shows evidence of bedding or fine laminations, it is <strong>shale</strong>; otherwise it is mudstone. Mudrocks form in very low energy environments, such as lakes, river backwaters, and the deep ocean.</p> <table style="height: 156px;"><caption>Table 6. 2 The main types of clastic sedimentary rocks and their characteristics.</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 14px;"><th style="height: 14px; width: 97.0625px;" scope="col">Group</th> <th style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;" scope="col">Examples</th> <th style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;" scope="col">Characteristics</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="background-color: #dbefe4;"><th style="height: 28px; width: 97.0625px;" rowspan="2" scope="row"><strong>Mudrock</strong></th> <td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;">mudstone</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">&gt;75% silt and clay, not bedded</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #dbefe4;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;">shale</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">&gt;75% silt and clay, thinly bedded</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #d9d9d8;"><th style="height: 29px; width: 97.0625px;" scope="row"><strong>Coal</strong></th> <td style="height: 29px; width: 101.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by fragments of partially decayed plant matter, often enclosed between beds of sandstone or mudrock</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #fdf9d0;"><th style="height: 57px; width: 97.0625px;" rowspan="3" scope="row"><strong>Sandstone</strong></th> <td style="height: 29px; width: 101.062px;">quartz sandstone</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by sand, &gt;90% quartz</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #fdf9d0;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;">arkose</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by sand, &gt;10% feldspar</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #fdf9d0;"><td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;">lithic wacke</td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by sand, &gt;10% rock fragments, &gt;15% silt and clay</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><th style="height: 14px; width: 97.0625px;" scope="row"><strong>Conglomerate</strong></th> <td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by rounded clasts, pebble size and larger</td> </tr> <tr style="background-color: #f3f3f3;"><th style="height: 14px; width: 97.0625px;" scope="row"><strong>Breccia</strong></th> <td style="height: 14px; width: 101.062px;"></td> <td style="height: 14px; width: 675.062px;">dominated by angular clasts, pebble size and larger</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div><p>Most coal forms in fluvial or delta environments where vegetation growth is vigorous and where decaying plant matter accumulates in long-lasting swamps with low oxygen levels. To avoid oxidation and breakdown, the organic matter must remain submerged for centuries or millennia, until it is covered with another layer of either muddy or sandy sediments.</p> <p>It is important to note that in some textbooks coal is described as an “organic sedimentary rock.” In this book, coal is classified with the clastic rocks for two reasons: first, because it is made up of fragments of organic matter; and second, because coal seams (sedimentary layers) are almost always interbedded with layers of clastic rocks, such as mudrock or sandstone. In other words, coal accumulates in environments where other clastic rocks accumulate.</p> <p>It’s worth taking a closer look at the different types of sandstone because sandstone is a common and important sedimentary rock. Typical sandstone compositions are shown in Figure 6.6. The term <strong>arenite</strong> applies to a so-called clean sandstone, meaning one with less than 15% silt and clay. Considering the sand-sized grains only, arenites with 90% or more quartz are called quartz arenites. If they have more than 10% feldspar and more feldspar than rock fragments, they are called feldspathic arenites or <strong>arkosic arenites</strong> (or just <strong>arkose</strong>). If they have more than 10% rock fragments, and more rock fragments than feldspar, they are <strong>lithic</strong><span class="footnote">“Lithic” means “rock.” Lithic clasts are rock fragments, as opposed to mineral fragments.</span><strong> arenites</strong>. A sandstone with more than 15% silt or clay is called a <strong>wacke </strong>(pronounced <em>wackie</em>). The terms <em>quartz wacke, lithic wacke</em>, and <em>feldspathic wacke</em> are used. Another name for a lithic wacke is <strong>greywacke</strong>.</p> <p>Some examples of sandstones, magnified in thin section are shown in Figure 6.7. (A thin section is rock sliced thin enough so that light can shine through.)</p> <p>Clastic sedimentary rocks in which a significant proportion of the clasts are larger than 2 mm are known as <strong>conglomerate</strong> if the clasts are well rounded, and <strong>breccia</strong> if they are angular. Conglomerates form in high-energy environments where the particles can become rounded, such as fast-flowing rivers. Breccias typically form where the particles are not transported a significant distance in water, such as alluvial fans and talus slopes. Some examples of clastic sedimentary rocks are shown on Figure 6.8.</p> <div><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_89" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-89" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/arenite-sandstones.png"><img class="wp-image-89" alt="Figure 6.6 A compositional triangle for arenite sandstones, with the three most common components of sand-sized grains: quartz, feldspar and rock fragments.

Others include <strong>chert</strong>, <strong>banded</strong> <strong>iron formation,</strong> and a variety of rocks that form when bodies of water evaporate. Biological processes are important in the formation of some chemical sedimentary rocks, especially limestone and chert. For example, limestone is made up almost entirely of fragments of marine<span class="footnote">We use the word <em>marine </em>when referring to salt water (i.e., oceanic) environments, and the word <em>aquatic </em>when referring to freshwater environments.</span> organisms that manufacture calcite for their shells and other hard parts, and most chert includes at least some of the silica <strong>tests</strong> (shells) of tiny marine organisms (such as diatoms and radiolaria).</p> <h1><strong>Limestone</strong></h1> <p>Almost all limestone forms in the oceans, and most of that forms on the shallow continental shelves, especially in tropical regions with coral reefs. Reefs are highly productive ecosystems populated by a wide range of organisms, many of which use calcium and bicarbonate ions in seawater to make carbonate minerals (especially calcite) for their shells and other structures. These include corals, of course, but also green and red algae, urchins, sponges, molluscs, and crustaceans. Especially after they die, but even while they are still alive, these organisms are eroded by waves and currents to produce carbonate fragments that accumulate in the surrounding region, as illustrated in Figure 6.9.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-933" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/corals-2.jpg"><img width="300" height="225" class="size-medium wp-image-933" alt="Figure 6.9 Various corals and green algae on a reef at Ambergris, Belize.

Reefs tend to form near the edges of steep drop-offs because the reef organisms thrive on nutrient-rich upwelling currents. As the reef builds up, it is eroded by waves and currents to produce carbonate sediments that are transported into the steep offshore <strong>fore-reef</strong> area and the shallower inshore <strong>back-reef</strong> area. These sediments are dominated by reef-type carbonate fragments of all sizes, including mud. In many such areas, carbonate-rich sediments also accumulate in quiet lagoons, where mud and mollusc-shell fragments predominate (Figure 6.11a) or in offshore areas with strong currents, where either foraminifera tests accumulate (Figure 6.11b) or calcite crystallizes inorganically to form <strong>ooids</strong> – spheres of calcite that form in shallow tropical ocean water with strong currents (Figure 6.11c).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_99" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-99" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/tropical-reef.png"><img width="400" height="115" class="wp-image-99" alt="Figure 6.10 Schematic cross-section through a typical tropical reef." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/tropical-reef.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-99">Figure 6.10 Schematic cross-section through a typical tropical reef.</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_931" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-931" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/carbs-2.png"><img width="300" height="215" class="size-medium wp-image-931" alt="Figure 6.11 Carbonate rocks and sediments: (a) mollusc-rich limestone formed in a lagoon area at Ambergris, Belize, (b) foraminifera-rich sediment from a submerged carbonate sandbar near to Ambergris, Belize (c) ooids from a beach at Joulters Cay, Bahamas." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/carbs-2-300x215.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-931">Figure 6.11 Carbonate rocks and sediments: (a) mollusc-rich limestone formed in a lagoon area at Ambergris, Belize, (b) foraminifera-rich sediment from a submerged carbonate sandbar near to Ambergris, Belize (c) ooids from a beach at Joulters Cay, Bahamas.</div></div> <p>Limestone also accumulates in deeper water, from the steady rain of the carbonate shells of tiny organisms that lived near the ocean surface.

Dolomite rock is quite common (there’s a whole Italian mountain range named after it), which is surprising since marine organisms don’t make dolomite. All of the dolomite found in ancient rocks has been formed through magnesium replacing some of the calcium in the calcite in carbonate muds and sands. This process is known as <strong>dolomitization</strong>, and it is thought to take place where magnesium-rich water percolates through the sediments in carbonate tidal flat environments.</p> <h1><strong>Chert and Banded Iron Formation</strong></h1> <p>As we’ve seen, not all marine organisms make their hard parts out of calcite; some, like radiolaria and diatoms, use silica, and when they die their tiny shells (or tests) settle slowly to the bottom where they accumulate as chert. In some cases, chert is deposited along with limestone in the moderately deep ocean, but the two tend to remain separate, so chert beds within limestone are quite common (Figure 6.13), as are nodules, link the flint nodules of the Cretaceous chalk of southeastern England. In other situations, and especially in very deep water, chert accumulates on its own, commonly in thin beds.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_932" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-932" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/chert-2.jpg"><img width="300" height="217" class="size-medium wp-image-932" alt="Figure 6.13 Chert (brown layers) interbedded with Triassic Quatsino Fm. limestone on Quadra Island, B.C.

All of the layers have been folded, and the chert, being insoluble and harder than limestone, stands out.</div></div> <p>Some ancient chert beds — most dating to between 1800 and 2400 Ma — are also combined with a rock known as <strong>banded iron formation (BIF)</strong>, a deep sea-floor deposit of iron oxide that is a common ore of iron (Figure 6.14). BIF forms when iron dissolved in seawater is oxidized, becomes insoluble, and sinks to the bottom in the same way that silica tests do to form chert. The prevalence of BIF in rocks dating from 2400 to 1800 Ma is due to the changes in the atmosphere and oceans that took place over that time period. Photosynthetic bacteria (i.e., <strong>cyanobacteria</strong>, a.k.a. blue-green algae) consume carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use solar energy to convert it to oxygen. These bacteria first evolved around 3500 Ma, and for the next billion years, almost all of that free oxygen was used up by chemical and biological processes, but by 2400 Ma free oxygen levels started to increase in the atmosphere and the oceans. Over a period of 600 million years, that oxygen gradually converted soluble ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) to insoluble ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>), which combined with oxygen to form the mineral hematite (Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), leading to the accumulation of BIFs. After 1800 Ma, little dissolved iron was left in the oceans and the formation of BIF essentially stopped.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-104" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Banded-iron-formation.png"><img width="400" height="195" class="wp-image-104" alt="Figure 6.14 Banded iron formation (red) interbedded with chert (white), Dales Gorge, Australia [By Dales Goge by Graeme Churchard under CC BY 2.0." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Banded-iron-formation.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-104">Figure 6.14 Banded iron formation (red) interbedded with chert (white), Dales Gorge, Australia</div></div> <h1><strong>Evaporites</strong></h1> <div><p>In arid regions, lakes and inland seas typically have no stream outlet and the water that flows into them is removed only by evaporation. Under these conditions, the water becomes increasingly concentrated with dissolved salts, and eventually some of these salts reach saturation levels and start to crystallize (Figure 6.15). Although all evaporite deposits are unique because of differences in the chemistry of the water, in most cases minor amounts of carbonates start to precipitate when the solution is reduced to about 50% of its original volume. Gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>·H<sub>2</sub>O) precipitates at about 20% of the original volume and halite (NaCl) precipitates at 10%. Other important evaporite minerals include sylvite (KCl) and borax (Na<sub>2</sub>B<sub>4</sub>O<sub>7</sub>·10H<sub>2</sub>O). Sylvite is mined at numerous locations across Saskatchewan (Figure 6.16) from evaporites that were deposited during the Devonian (~385 Ma) when an inland sea occupied much of the region.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_938" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-938" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/spotted-lake-2.jpg"><img width="300" height="117" class="size-medium wp-image-938" alt="Figure 6.15 Spotted Lake, near Osoyoos, B.C.

In order for sediments to be preserved long enough to be turned into rock, a process that takes millions or tens of millions of years, they need to have been deposited in a basin that will last that long. Most such basins are formed by plate tectonic processes, and some of the more important examples are shown in Figure 6.18.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-111" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/basins.png"><img class="wp-image-111" alt="Figure 6.18 Some of the more important types of tectonically produced basins: (a) trench basin, (b) forearc basin, (c) foreland basin, and (d) rift basin." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/basins.png" width="400" height="170" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-111">Figure 6.18 Some of the more important types of tectonically produced basins: (a) trench basin, (b) forearc basin, (c) foreland basin, and (d) rift basin</div></div> <p>Trench basins form where a subducting oceanic plate dips beneath the overriding continental or oceanic crust. They can be several kilometres deep, and in many cases, host thick sequences of sediments from eroding coastal mountains. There is a well-developed trench basin off the west coast of Vancouver Island. A forearc basin lies between the subduction zone and the volcanic arc, and may be formed in part by friction between the subducting plate and the overriding plate, which pulls part of the overriding plate down. The Strait of Georgia is a forearc basin. A foreland basin is caused by the mass of the volcanic range depressing the crust on either side. Foreland basins are not only related to volcanic ranges, but can form adjacent to fold belt mountains like the Canadian Rockies. A rift basin forms where continental crust is being pulled apart, and the crust on both sides the rift subsides. As rifting continues this eventually becomes a narrow sea, and then an ocean basin. The East African rift basin represents an early stage in this process.</p> <h3>Attributions</h3> <p><strong>Figure 6.17</strong><br /> Adaptation based on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depositional_environment#mediaviewer/File:SedimentaryEnvironment.jpg">Schematic diagram showing types of depositional environment</a> by <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Mikenorton">Mike Norton</a> under <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/">CC BY SA 3.0</a></p> </div></div>

The implication is that tilted sedimentary layers observed to day must have been subjected to tectonic forces.</li> <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>principle of superposition</strong> states that sedimentary layers are deposited in sequence, and that unless the entire sequence has been turned over by tectonic processes, the layers at the bottom are older than those at the top.</li> <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>principle of inclusions</strong> states that any rock fragments in a sedimentary layer must be older than the layer. For example, the cobbles in a conglomerate must have been formed before the conglomerate.</li> <li style="padding-left: 30px;">The <strong>principle of faunal succession</strong> states that there is a well-defined order in which organisms have evolved through geological time, and therefore the identification of specific fossils in a rock can be used to determine its age.</li> </ul> <p>In addition to these principles that apply to all sedimentary rocks, a number of other important characteristics of sedimentary processes lead to the development of distinctive sedimentary features in specific sedimentary environments. By understanding the origins of these features, we can make some very useful inferences about the processes that led to deposition the rocks that we are studying.</p> <p><strong>Bedding</strong>, for example, is the separation of sediments into layers that either differ from one another in textures, composition, colour, or weathering characteristics, or are separated by <strong>partings </strong>— narrow gaps between adjacent beds (Figure 6.19). Bedding is an indication of changes in depositional processes that may be related to seasonal differences, changes in climate, changes in locations of rivers or deltas, or tectonic changes. Partings may represent periods of non-deposition that could range from a few decades to a few centuries. Bedding can form in almost any depositional environment.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_114" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-114" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Triassic-Sulphur.png"><img width="400" height="291" class="wp-image-114" alt="Figure 6.19 The Triassic Sulphur Mt.

Some graded beds are reversed (coarser at the top), and this normally results from deposition by a fast-moving debris flow (see Chapter 15). Most graded beds form in a submarine-fan environment (see Figure 6.17), where sediment-rich flows descend periodically from a shallow marine shelf down a slope and onto the deeper sea floor.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-930" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/bouma-2.png"><img width="300" height="188" class="size-medium wp-image-930" alt="Figure 6.22 A graded turbidite bed in Cretaceous Spray Formation rocks on Gabriola Island, B.C.

The International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS) (<a href="http://www.stratigraphy.org/">http://www.stratigraphy.org/</a>) has established a set of conventions for grouping, describing, and naming sedimentary rock units.</p> <p>The main stratigraphic unit is a <strong>formation</strong>, which according to the ICS, should be established with the following principles in mind:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>The contrast in lithology between formations required to justify their establishment varies with the complexity of the geology of a region and the detail needed for geologic mapping and to work out its geologic history. No formation is considered justifiable and useful that cannot be delineated at the scale of geologic mapping practiced in the region. The thickness of formations may range from less than a meter to several thousand meters.</em></p> <p>In other words, a formation is a series of beds that is distinct from other beds above and below, and is thick enough to be shown on the geological maps that are widely used within the area in question. In most parts of the world, geological mapping is done at a relatively coarse scale, and so most formations are in the order of a few hundred metres thick. At that thickness, a typical formation would appear on a typical geological map as an area that is at least a few millimetres thick.</p> <p>A series of formations can be classified together to define a <strong>group</strong>, which could be as much as a few thousand metres thick, and represents a series of rocks that were deposited within a single basin (or a series of related and adjacent basins) over a few million to a few tens of millions of years.</p> <p>In areas where detailed geological information is needed (for example, within a mining or petroleum district) a formation might be divided into <strong>members</strong>, where each member has a specific and distinctive lithology. For example, a formation that includes both shale and sandstone might be divided into members, each of which is either shale or sandstone. In some areas, where particular detail is needed, members may be divided into beds, but this is only applicable to beds that have a special geological significance. Groups, formations, and members are typically named for the area where they are found.</p> <p>The sedimentary rocks of the Nanaimo Group provide a useful example for understanding groups, formations, and members. During the latter part of the Cretaceous Period, from about 90 Ma to 65 Ma, a thick sequence of clastic rocks was deposited in a foreland basin between what is now Vancouver Island and the B.C. mainland (Figure 6.25). The Nanaimo Group strata comprise a 5000 m thick sequence of conglomerate, sandstone, and mudstone layers. Coal was mined from Nanaimo Group rocks from around 1850 to 1950 in the Nanaimo region, and is still being mined in the Campbell River area.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/06/Upper-Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-rocks.png"><img class="wp-image-123" alt="Figure 6.25 The distribution of the Upper Cretaceous Nanaimo Group rocks on Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands and in the Vancouver area.

In general, the boundaries between formations are based on major lithological differences. As can be seen in the far-right column of Table 6.4, a wide range of depositional environments existed during the accumulation of the Nanaimo Group rocks, from nearshore marine for the Comox and Haslam Formation, to fluvial and deltaic with backwater swampy environments for the coal-bearing Extension, Pender, and Protection Formations, to a deep-water submarine fan environment for the upper six formations.

In most cases, this is sedimentary or igneous rock, but metamorphic rock that reaches the surface and is then reburied can also be considered a parent rock. On the other hand, if, for example, a mudstone is metamorphosed to slate and then buried deeper where it is metamorphosed to schist, the parent rock of the schist is mudstone, not slate. The critical feature of the parent rock is its mineral composition because it is the stability of minerals that counts when metamorphism takes place. In other words, when a rock is subjected to increased temperatures, certain minerals may become unstable and start to recrystallize into new minerals.</p> <h1><strong>Temperature</strong></h1> <p>The temperature that the rock is subjected to is a key variable in controlling the type of metamorphism that takes place. As we learned in the context of igneous rocks, mineral stability is a function of temperature, pressure, and the presence of fluids (especially water). All minerals are stable over a specific range of temperatures. For example, quartz is stable from environmental temperatures (whatever the weather can throw at it) all the way up to about 1800°C. If the pressure is higher, that upper limit will be higher. If there is water present, it will be lower. On the other hand, most clay minerals are only stable up to about 150° or 200°C; above that, they transform into micas. Most other common minerals have upper limits between 150°C and 1000°C.</p> <p>Some minerals will crystallize into different <strong>polymorphs</strong> (same composition, but different crystalline structure) depending on the temperature and pressure. Quartz is a good example as slightly different forms are stable between 0°C and 1800°C. The minerals kyanite, andalusite, and sillimanite are polymorphs with the composition Al2SiO5. They are stable at different pressures and temperatures, and, as we will see later, they are important indicators of pressures and temperatures in metamorphic rocks (Figure 7.3).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_424" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-424" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0031.png"><img class="wp-image-424" alt="Figure 7.3 The temperature and pressure stability fields of the three polymorphs of Al2SiO5.

[SE]</div></div> <h1><strong><br /> Pressure</strong></h1> <p>Pressure is important in metamorphic processes for two main reasons. First, it has implications for mineral stability (Figure 7.3). Second, it has implications for the texture of metamorphic rocks. Rocks that are subjected to very high confining pressures are typically denser than others because the mineral grains are squeezed together (Figure 7.4a), and because they may contain mineral polymorphs in which the atoms are more closely packed. Because of plate tectonics, pressures within the crust are typically not applied equally in all directions. In areas of plate convergence, the pressure in one direction (perpendicular to the direction of convergence) is typically greater than in the other directions (Figure 7.4b). In situations where different blocks of the crust are being pushed in different directions, the rocks will be subjected to sheer stress (Figure 7.4c).</p> <p>One of the results of directed pressure and sheer stress is that rocks become <strong>foliated </strong>— meaning that they’ll have a directional fabric. Foliation is described in more detail later in this chapter.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_425" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-425" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image004.png"><img class="wp-image-425" alt="Figure 7.4 An illustration of different types of pressure on rocks.

(In a and b there is also pressure in and out of the page.) [SE]</div></div> <h1><strong>Fluids</strong></h1> <p>Water is the main fluid present within rocks of the crust, and the only one that we’ll consider here. The presence of water is important for two main reasons. First, water facilitates the transfer of ions between minerals and within minerals, and therefore increases the rates at which metamorphic reactions take place. So, while the water doesn’t necessarily change the outcome of a metamorphic process, it speeds the process up so metamorphism might take place over a shorter time period, or metamorphic processes that might not otherwise have had time to be completed are completed.</p> <p>Secondly, water, especially hot water, can have elevated concentrations of dissolved substances, and therefore it is an important medium for moving certain elements around within the crust. So not only does water facilitate metamorphic reactions on a grain-to-grain basis, it also allows for the transportation of ions from one place to another. This is very important in hydrothermal processes, which are discussed toward the end of this chapter, and in the formation of mineral deposits.</p> <h1><strong>Time</strong></h1> <p>Most metamorphic reactions take place at very slow rates. For example, the growth of new minerals within a rock during metamorphism has been estimated to be about 1 mm per million years. For this reason, it is very difficult to study metamorphic processes in a lab.</p> <p>While the rate of metamorphism is slow, the tectonic processes that lead to metamorphism are also very slow, so in most cases, the chance for metamorphic reactions to be completed is high. For example, one important metamorphic setting is many kilometres deep within the roots of mountain ranges.

Some types of metamorphic rocks, such as quartzite and marble, which also form in directed-pressure situations, do not necessarily exhibit foliation because their minerals (quartz and calcite respectively) do not tend to show alignment (see Figure 7.12).</p> <p>When a rock is squeezed under directed pressure during metamorphism it is likely to be deformed, and this can result in a textural change such that the minerals are elongated in the direction perpendicular to the main stress (Figure 7.5). This contributes to the formation of foliation.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_427" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-427" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image006.png"><img width="400" height="154" class="wp-image-427" alt="Figure 7.5 The textural effects of squeezing during metamorphism.

[SE]</div></div> <p>When a rock is both heated and squeezed during metamorphism, and the temperature change is enough for new minerals to form from existing ones, there is a likelihood that the new minerals will be forced to grow with their long axes perpendicular to the direction of squeezing. This is illustrated in Figure 7.6, where the parent rock is shale, with bedding as shown. After both heating and squeezing, new minerals have formed within the rock, generally parallel to each other, and the original bedding has been largely obliterated.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_428" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-428" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image007.png"><img width="400" height="131" class="wp-image-428" alt="Figure 7.6 The textural effects of squeezing and aligned mineral growth during metamorphism.

The rock also has a strong slaty foliation, which is horizontal in this view, and has developed because the rock was being squeezed during metamorphism. The rock has split from bedrock along this foliation plane, and you can see that other weaknesses are present in the same orientation.</p> <p>Squeezing and heating alone (as shown in Figure 7.5) and squeezing, heating, and formation of new minerals (as shown in Figure 7.6) can contribute to foliation, but most foliation develops when new minerals are forced to grow perpendicular to the direction of greatest stress (Figure 7.6). This effect is especially strong if the new minerals are platy like mica or elongated like amphibole. The mineral crystals don’t have to be large to produce foliation. Slate, for example, is characterized by aligned flakes of mica that are too small to see.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_429" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-429" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image008.jpg"><img width="400" height="227" class="wp-image-429" alt="Figure 7.7 A slate boulder on the side of Mt.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The various types of foliated metamorphic rocks, listed in order of the <strong>grade</strong> or intensity of metamorphism and the type of foliation are <strong>slate</strong>, <strong>phyllite</strong>, <strong>schist</strong>, and <strong>gneiss</strong> (Figure 7.8). As already noted, slate is formed from the low-grade metamorphism of shale, and has microscopic clay and mica crystals that have grown perpendicular to the stress. Slate tends to break into flat sheets. Phyllite is similar to slate, but has typically been heated to a higher temperature; the micas have grown larger and are visible as a sheen on the surface. Where slate is typically planar, phyllite can form in wavy layers. In the formation of schist, the temperature has been hot enough so that individual mica crystals are visible, and other mineral crystals, such as quartz, feldspar, or garnet may also be visible. In gneiss, the minerals may have separated into bands of different colours. In the example shown in Figure 7.8d, the dark bands are largely amphibole while the light-coloured bands are feldspar and quartz. Most gneiss has little or no mica because it forms at temperatures higher than those under which micas are stable. Unlike slate and phyllite, which typically only form from mudrock, schist, and especially gneiss, can form from a variety of parent rocks, including mudrock, sandstone, conglomerate, and a range of both volcanic and intrusive igneous rocks.</p> <p>Schist and gneiss can be named on the basis of important minerals that are present. For example a schist derived from basalt is typically rich in the mineral chlorite, so we call it chlorite schist. One derived from shale may be a muscovite-biotite schist, or just a mica schist, or if there are garnets present it might be mica-garnet schist. Similarly, a gneiss that originated as basalt and is dominated by amphibole, is an amphibole gneiss or, more accurately, an <strong>amphibolite</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_948" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-948" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/foliated-textures-2.png"><img width="300" height="266" class="size-medium wp-image-948" alt="Figure 7.8 Examples of foliated metamorphic rocks [a, b, and d: SE, c: Michael C.

The kinds of rocks that can be expected to form at different metamorphic grades from various parent rocks are listed in Table 7.1. Some rocks, such as granite, do not change much at the lower metamorphic grades because their minerals are still stable up to several hundred degrees.</p> <table><caption>Table 7.1 A rough guide to the types of metamorphic rocks that form from different parent rocks at different grades of regional metamorphism</caption> <tbody><tr><td></td> <th scope="col"><strong>Very Low Grade</strong></th> <th scope="col"><strong>Low Grade</strong></th> <th scope="col"><strong>Medium Grade</strong></th> <th scope="col"><strong>High Grade</strong></th> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Approximate Temperature Ranges</strong></th> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> <td></td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Parent Rock</strong></th> <td>150-300°C</td> <td>300-450°C</td> <td>450-550°C</td> <td>Above 550°C</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Mudrock</strong></th> <td>slate</td> <td>phyllite</td> <td>schist</td> <td>gneiss</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Granite</strong></th> <td>no change</td> <td>no change</td> <td>no change</td> <td>granite gneiss</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Basalt</strong></th> <td>chlorite schist</td> <td>chlorite schist</td> <td>amphibolite</td> <td>amphibolite</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Sandstone</strong></th> <td>no change</td> <td>little change</td> <td>quartzite</td> <td>quartzite</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row"><strong>Limestone</strong></th> <td>little change</td> <td>marble</td> <td>marble</td> <td>marble</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Metamorphic rocks that form under either low-pressure conditions or just confining pressure do not become foliated. In most cases, this is because they are not buried deeply, and the heat for the metamorphism comes from a body of magma that has moved into the upper part of the crust. This is <strong>contact metamorphism</strong>. Some examples of non-foliated metamorphic rocks are <strong>marble</strong>, <strong>quartzite</strong>, and <strong>hornfels</strong>.</p> <p>Marble is metamorphosed limestone. When it forms, the calcite crystals tend to grow larger, and any sedimentary textures and fossils that might have been present are destroyed. If the original limestone was pure calcite, then the marble will likely be white (as in Figure 7.10), but if it had various impurities, such as clay, silica, or magnesium, the marble could be “marbled” in appearance.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_430" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-430" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Marble-.png"><img width="400" height="170" class="wp-image-430" alt="Figure 7.10 Marble with visible calcite crystals (left) and an outcrop of banded marble (right) [SE (left) and http://gallery.usgs.gov/images/08_11_2010/a1Uh83Jww6_08_11_2010/large/DSCN2868.JPG (right)]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Marble-.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-430">Figure 7.10 Marble with visible calcite crystals (left) and an outcrop of banded marble (right) [SE (left) and http://gallery.usgs.gov/images/08_11_2010/a1Uh83Jww6_08_11_2010/large/DSCN2868.JPG (right)]</div></div> <p>Quartzite is metamorphosed sandstone (Figure 7.11).

[SE]</div></div> <p>Most regional metamorphism takes place within continental crust. While rocks can be metamorphosed at depth in most areas, the potential for metamorphism is greatest in the roots of mountain ranges where there is a strong likelihood for burial of relatively young sedimentary rock to great depths, as depicted in Figure 7.15. An example would be the Himalayan Range. At this continent-continent convergent boundary, sedimentary rocks have been both thrust up to great heights (nearly 9,000 m above sea level) and also buried to great depths. Considering that the normal geothermal gradient (the rate of increase in temperature with depth) is around 30°C per kilometre, rock buried to 9 km below sea level in this situation could be close to 18 km below the surface of the ground, and it is reasonable to expect temperatures up to 500°C. Metamorphic rocks formed there are likely to be foliated because of the strong directional pressure of converging plates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-436" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image020.png"><img width="400" height="290" class="wp-image-436" alt="Figure 7.15 a: Regional metamorphism beneath a mountain range related to continent-continent collision (typical geothermal gradient).

(Example: Himalayan Range) [SE]</div></div> <p>At an oceanic spreading ridge, recently formed oceanic crust of gabbro and basalt is slowly moving away from the plate boundary (Figure 7.16). Water within the crust is forced to rise in the area close to the source of volcanic heat, and this draws more water in from farther out, which eventually creates a convective system where cold seawater is drawn into the crust and then out again onto the sea floor near the ridge. The passage of this water through the oceanic crust at 200° to 300°C promotes metamorphic reactions that change the original pyroxene in the rock to chlorite and serpentine. Because this metamorphism takes place at temperatures well below the temperature at which the rock originally formed (~1200°C), it is known as <strong>retrograde metamorphism</strong>. The rock that forms in this way is known as <strong>greenstone</strong> if it isn’t foliated, or <strong>greenschist</strong> if it is. Chlorite ((Mg<sub>5</sub>Al)(AlSi<sub>3</sub>)O<sub>10</sub>(OH)<sub>8</sub>) and serpentine ((Mg, Fe)<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>(OH)<sub>4</sub>) are both “<strong>hydrated minerals</strong>” meaning that they have water (as OH) in their chemical formulas. When metamorphosed ocean crust is later subducted, the chlorite and serpentine are converted into new non-hydrous minerals (e.g., garnet and pyroxene) and the water that is released migrates into the overlying mantle, where it contributes to flux melting (Chapter 3, section 3.2).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_437" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-437" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image021.png"><img width="400" height="263" class="wp-image-437" alt="Figure 7.16 b: Regional metamorphism of oceanic crustal rock on either side of a spreading ridge.

(Example: Juan de Fuca spreading ridge) [SE]</div></div> <p>At a subduction zone, oceanic crust is forced down into the hot mantle. But because the oceanic crust is now relatively cool, especially along its sea-floor upper surface, it does not heat up quickly, and the subducting rock remains several hundreds of degrees cooler than the surrounding mantle (Figure 7.17). A special type of metamorphism takes place under these very high-pressure but relatively low-temperature conditions, producing an amphibole mineral known as <strong>glaucophane</strong> (Na<sub>2</sub>(Mg<sub>3</sub>Al<sub>2</sub>)Si<sub>8</sub>O<sub>22</sub>(OH)<sub>2</sub>), which is blue in colour, and is a major component of a rock known as <strong>blueschist</strong>.</p> <p>If you’ve never seen or even heard of blueschist, it’s not surprising. What is surprising is that anyone has seen it! Most blueschist forms in subduction zones, continues to be subducted, turns into <strong>eclogite</strong> at about 35 km depth, and then eventually sinks deep into the mantle — never to be seen again. In only a few places in the world, where the subduction process has been interrupted by some tectonic process, has partially subducted blueschist rock returned to the surface. One such place is the area around San Francisco; the rock is known as the Franciscan Complex (Figure 7.18).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-438" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image022.png"><img width="400" height="314" class="wp-image-438" alt="Figure 7.17 c: Regional metamorphism of oceanic crust at a subduction zone.

Such magma bodies, at temperatures of around 1000°C, heat up the surrounding rock, leading to contact metamorphism (Figure 7.19). Because this happens at relatively shallow depths, in the absence of directed pressure, the resulting rock does not normally develop foliation.

[SE]</div></div> <p>Regional metamorphism also takes place within volcanic-arc mountain ranges, and because of the extra heat associated with the volcanism, the geothermal gradient is typically a little steeper in these settings (somewhere between 40° and 50°C/km). As a result higher grades of metamorphism can take place closer to surface than is the case in other areas (Figure 7.19).</p> <p>Another way to understand metamorphism is by using a diagram that shows temperature on one axis and depth (which is equivalent to pressure) on the other (Figure 7.20). The three heavy dotted lines on this diagram represent Earth’s geothermal gradients under different conditions. In most areas, the rate of increase in temperature with depth is 30°C/km. In other words, if you go 1,000 m down into a mine, the temperature will be roughly 30°C warmer than the average temperature at the surface. In most parts of southern Canada, the average surface temperature is about 10°C, so at 1,000 m depth, it will be about 40°C. That’s uncomfortably hot, so deep mines must have effective ventilation systems. This typical geothermal gradient is shown by the green dotted line in Figure 7.20. At 10 km depth, the temperature is about 300°C and at 20 km it’s about 600°C.</p> <p>In volcanic areas, the geothermal gradient is more like 40° to 50°C/km, so the temperature at 10 km depth is in the 400° to 500°C range. Along subduction zones, as described above, the cold oceanic crust keeps temperatures low, so the gradient is typically less than 10°C/km. The various types of metamorphism described above are represented in Figure 7.20 with the same letters (a through e) used in Figures 7.14 to 7.17 and 7.19.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_947" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-947" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/depth-temp.png"><img width="300" height="242" class="size-medium wp-image-947" alt="Figure 7.20 Types of metamorphism shown in the context of depth and temperature under different conditions.

The rocks of the sillimanite zone were likely heated to over 700°C, and therefore must have buried to depths between 20 km and 25 km.

As is the case with all mountain ranges, the crust became thickened as the mountains grew, and it was pushed farther down into the mantle than the surrounding crust. This happens because Earth’s crust is floating on the underlying mantle. As the formation of mountains adds weight, the crust in that area sinks farther down into the mantle to compensate for the added weight. The likely pattern of metamorphism in this situation is shown in cross-section in Figure 7.23a. The mountains were eventually eroded (over tens of millions of years), allowing the crust to rebound upward and exposing the metamorphic rock (Figure 7.23b).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-444" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image029.png"><img width="400" height="305" class="wp-image-444" alt="Figure 7.23 (a) Schematic cross-section through the Meguma Terrane during the Devonian.

Obviously many different patterns of regional metamorphism exist, depending on the parent rocks, the geothermal gradient, the depth of burial, the pressure regime, and the amount of time available. The important point is that regional metamorphism happens only at significant depths. The greatest likelihood of attaining those depths, and then having the once-buried rocks eventually exposed at the surface, is where mountain ranges existed and have since been largely eroded away. As this happens typically at convergent plate boundaries, directed pressures can be strong, and regionally altered rocks are almost always foliated.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 7.4 Scottish Metamorphic Zones </strong></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image031.png"><img width="300" height="298" class="aligncenter wp-image-446 size-medium" alt="The map shown here represents the part of western Scotland between the Great Glen Fault and the Highland Boundary Fault.

Any type of magma body can lead to contact metamorphism, from a thin dyke to a large stock. The type and intensity of the metamorphism, and width of the metamorphic <strong>aureole</strong> will depend on a number of factors, including the type of country rock, the temperature of the intruding body and the size of the body (Figure 7.24). A large intrusion will contain more thermal energy and will cool much more slowly than a small one, and therefore will provide a longer time and more heat for metamorphism. That will allow the heat to extend farther into the country rock, creating a larger aureole.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-447" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image032.png"><img width="400" height="413" class="wp-image-447" alt="Figure 7.24 Schematic cross-section of the middle and upper crust showing two magma bodies.

[SE]</div></div> <p>Contact metamorphic aureoles are typically quite small, from just a few centimetres around small dykes and sills, to as much as 100 m around a large stock. As was shown in Figure 7.20, contact metamorphism can take place over a wide range of temperatures — from around 300° to over 800°C — and of course the type of metamorphism, and new minerals formed, will vary accordingly. The nature of the country rock is also important. Mudrock or volcanic rock will be converted to hornfels. Limestone will be metamorphosed to marble, and sandstone to quartzite.</p> <p>A hot body of magma in the upper crust can create a very dynamic situation that may have geologically interesting and economically important implications. In the simplest cases, water does not play a big role, and the main process is transfer of heat from the pluton to the surrounding rock, creating a zone of contact metamorphism (Figure 7.25a). In many cases, however, water is released from the magma body as crystallization takes place, and this water is dispersed along fractures in the country rock (Figure 7.25b). The water released from a magma chamber is typically rich in dissolved minerals. As this water cools, is chemically changed by the surrounding rocks, or boils because of a drop in pressure, minerals are deposited, forming veins within the fractures in the country rock. Quartz veins are common in this situation, and they might also include pyrite, hematite, calcite, and even silver and gold.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_451" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-451" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/metamorphism-and-alteration-around-a-pluton.png"><img width="400" height="137" class="wp-image-451" alt="Figure 7.25 Depiction of metamorphism and alteration around a pluton in the upper crust.

In some cases, this may initiate a convection system where groundwater circulates past the pluton. Such a system could operate for thousands of years, resulting in the circulation of millions of tonnes of groundwater from the surrounding region past the pluton. Hot water circulating through the rocks can lead to significant changes in the mineralogy of the rock, including alteration of feldspars to clays, and deposition of quartz, calcite, and other minerals in fractures and other open spaces (Figure 7.26). As with the magmatic fluids, the nature of this circulating groundwater can also change adjacent to, or above, the pluton, resulting in deposition of other minerals, including ore minerals. Metamorphism in which much of the change is derived from fluids passing through the rock is known as <strong>metasomatism</strong>. When hot water contributes to changes in rocks, including mineral alteration and formation of veins, it is known as <strong>hydrothermal alteration</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_946" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-946" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/calcite-vein-2.jpg"><img width="300" height="217" class="size-medium wp-image-946" alt="Figure 7.26 Calcite veins in limestone of the Comox Formation, Nanaimo, B.C.

We can tell the relative ages of rocks (for example, whether one rock is older than another) based on their spatial relationships; we can use fossils to date sedimentary rocks because we have a detailed record of the evolution of life on Earth; and we can use a range of isotopic techniques to determine the actual ages (in millions of years) of igneous and metamorphic rocks.</p> <p>But just because we can measure geological time doesn’t mean that we understand it. One of the biggest hurdles faced by geology students, and geologists as well, in understanding geology, is to really come to grips with the slow rates at which geological processes happen and the vast amount of time involved.</p></div>

While doing his work, he had many opportunities to look at the Paleozoic and Mesozoic sedimentary rocks of the region, and he did so in a way that few had done before. Smith noticed the textural similarities and differences between rocks in different locations, and more importantly, he discovered that fossils could be used to correlate rocks of the same age. Smith is credited with formulating the <strong>principle of faunal succession</strong> (the concept that specific types of organisms lived during different time intervals), and he used it to great effect in his monumental project to create a geological map of England and Wales, published in 1815. (For more on William Smith, including a large-scale digital copy of the famous map, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_%28geologist%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Smith_%28geologist%29</a>.)</p> <p>Inset into Smith’s great geological map is a small diagram showing a schematic geological cross-section extending from the Thames estuary of eastern England all the way to the west coast of Wales. Smith shows the sequence of rocks, from the Paleozoic rocks of Wales and western England, through the Mesozoic rocks of central England, to the Cenozoic rocks of the area around London (Figure 8.2). Although Smith did not put any dates on these — because he didn’t know them — he was aware of the <strong>principle of superposition</strong> (the idea, developed much earlier by the Danish theologian and scientist Nicholas Steno, that young sedimentary rocks form on top of older ones), and so he knew that this diagram represented a stratigraphic column. And because almost every period of the Phanerozoic is represented along that section through Wales and England, it is a primitive geological time scale.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-728" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/geological-map-of-England-and-Wales.png"><img class="wp-image-728 size-full" alt="Figure 8.2 William Smith’s “Sketch of the succession of strata and their relative altitudes,” an inset on his geological map of England and Wales (with era names added).

Many of the periods are named for places where rocks of that age are found in Europe, such as Cambrian for Cambria (Wales), Devonian for Devon in England, Jurassic for the Jura Mountains in France and Switzerland, and Permian for the Perm region of Russia. Some are named for the type of rock that is common during that age, such as Carboniferous for the coal- and carbonate-bearing rocks of England, and Cretaceous for the chalks of England and France.</p> <p>The early time scales were only relative because 19th century geologists did not know the ages of the rocks. That information was not available until the development of isotopic dating techniques early in the 20th century.</p> <p>The geological time scale is currently maintained by the International Commission on Stratigraphy (ICS), which is part of the International Union of Geological Sciences. The time scale is continuously being updated as we learn more about the timing and nature of past geological events. You can view the ICS time scale at http://www.stratigraphy.org/index.php/ics-chart-timescale. It would be a good idea to print a copy (in colour) to put on your wall while you are studying geology.</p> <p>Geological time has been divided into four eons: Hadean, Archean, Proterozoic, and Phanerozoic, and as shown in Figure 8.3, the first three of these represent almost 90% of Earth’s history. The last one, the Phanerozoic (meaning “visible life”), is the time that we are most familiar with because Phanerozoic rocks are the most common on Earth, and they contain evidence of the life forms that we are all somewhat familiar with.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_729" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-729" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/eons-of-Earth.png"><img class="wp-image-729" alt="4570 Ma (Hadean), 3850 Ma (Arhcean), 2500 Ma (Proterozoic), 540 Ma (Phanerozoic)" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/eons-of-Earth.png" height="94" width="600" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-729">Figure 8.3 The eons of Earth’s history [SE]</div></div> <p>The Phanerozoic — the past 540 Ma of Earth’s history — is divided into three eras: the Paleozoic (“early life”), the Mesozoic (“middle life”), and the Cenozoic (“new life”), and each of these is divided into a number of periods (Figure 8.4).

Dinosaurs became extinct at the start of the Cenozoic, after which birds and mammals radiated to fill the available habitats. Earth was very warm during the early Eocene and has steadily cooled ever since. Glaciers first appeared on Antarctica in the Oligocene and then on Greenland in the Miocene, and covered much of North America and Europe by the Pleistocene. The most recent of the Pleistocene glaciations ended around 11,700 years ago. The current epoch is known as the Holocene. Epochs are further divided into ages (a.k.a. stages), but we won’t be going into that level of detail here.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-731" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Cenozoic.png"><img class="wp-image-731" alt="Figure 8.5 The periods (middle row) and epochs (bottom row) of the Cenozoic [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Cenozoic.png" height="138" width="600" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-731">Figure 8.5 The periods (middle row) and epochs (bottom row) of the Cenozoic [SE]</div></div> <p>Most of the boundaries between the periods and epochs of the geological time scale have been fixed on the basis of significant changes in the fossil record. For example, as already noted, the boundary between the Cretaceous and the Paleogene coincides exactly with the extinction of the dinosaurs. That’s not a coincidence. Many other types of organisms went extinct at this time, and the boundary between the two periods marks the division between sedimentary rocks with Cretaceous organisms below, and Paleogene organisms above.</p> </div></div>

There are a few simple rules for doing this, some of which we’ve already looked at in Chapter 6. For example, the principle of superposition states that sedimentary layers are deposited in sequence, and, unless the entire sequence has been turned over by tectonic processes or disrupted by faulting, the layers at the bottom are older than those at the top. The <strong>principle of inclusions</strong> states that any rock fragments that are included in rock must be older than the rock in which they are included. For example, a <strong>xenolith</strong> in an igneous rock or a clast in sedimentary rock must be older than the rock that includes it (Figure 8.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_732" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-732" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/xenolith-of-diorite.jpg"><img width="400" height="301" class="wp-image-732" alt="Figure 8.6a A xenolith of diorite incorporated into a basalt lava flow, Mauna Kea volcano, Hawaii.

An example of this is given in Figure 8.7, which shows three different sedimentary layers. The lower sandstone layer is disrupted by two <strong>faults</strong>, so we can infer that the faults are younger than that layer. But the faults do not appear to continue into the coal seam, and they certainly do not continue into the upper sandstone. So we can infer that coal seam is younger than the faults (because it disrupts them), and of course the upper sandstone is youngest of all, because it lies on top of the coal seam.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_956" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-956" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/cavan-2.png"><img width="300" height="102" class="size-medium wp-image-956" alt="Figure 8.7 Superposition and cross-cutting relationships in Cretaceous Nanaimo Group rocks in Nanaimo, B.C.

Recognizing unconformities is important for understanding time relationships in sedimentary sequences. An example of an unconformity is shown in Figure 8.8.

The difference in time between the youngest of the Proterozoic rocks and the oldest of the Paleozoic rocks is close to 300 million years.

They help us to understand evolution and life in general; they provide critical information for understanding depositional environments and changes in Earth’s climate; and, of course, they can be used to date rocks.</p> <p>Although the recognition of fossils goes back hundreds of years, the systematic cataloguing and assignment of relative ages to different organisms from the distant past — paleontology — only dates back to the earliest part of the 19th century. The oldest undisputed fossils are from rocks dated around 3.5 Ga, and although fossils this old are typically poorly preserved and are not useful for dating rocks, they can still provide important information about conditions at the time. The oldest well-understood fossils are from rocks dating back to around 600 Ma, and the sedimentary record from that time forward is rich in fossil remains that provide a detailed record of the history of life. However, as anyone who has gone hunting for fossils knows, that does not mean that all sedimentary rocks have visible fossils or that they are easy to find. Fossils alone cannot provide us with numerical ages of rocks, but over the past century geologists have acquired enough isotopic dates from rocks associated with fossil-bearing rocks (such as igneous dykes cutting through sedimentary layers) to be able to put specific time limits on most fossils.</p> <p>A very selective history of life on Earth over the past 600 million years is provided in Figure 8.10. The major groups of organisms that we are familiar with evolved between the late Proterozoic and the Cambrian (~600 Ma to ~520 Ma). Plants, which evolved in the oceans as green algae, came onto land during the Ordovician (~450 Ma). Insects, which evolved from marine arthropods, came onto land during the Devonian (400 Ma), and amphibians (i.e., vertebrates) came onto land about 50 million years later. By the late Carboniferous, trees had evolved from earlier plants, and reptiles had evolved from amphibians. By the mid-Triassic, dinosaurs and mammals had evolved from very different branches of the reptiles; birds evolved from dinosaurs during the Jurassic. Flowering plants evolved in the late Jurassic or early Cretaceous. The earliest primates evolved from other mammals in the early Paleogene, and the genus <em>Homo </em>evolved during the late Neogene (~2.8 Ma).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_738" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-738" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Proterozoic-and-the-Phanerozoic.png"><img class="wp-image-738" alt="Figure 8.10 A summary of life on Earth during the late Proterozoic and the Phanerozoic.

This is William Smith’s principle of faunal succession, although of course it doesn’t just apply to “fauna” (animals); it can also apply to fossils of plants and those of simple organisms.</p> <p>The Phanerozoic has seen five major extinctions, as indicated in Figure 8.10. The most significant of these was at the end of the Permian, which saw the extinction of over 80% of all species and over 90% of all marine species. Most well-known types of organisms were decimated by this event, but only a few became completely extinct, including trilobites. The second most significant extinction was at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary (K-Pg, a.k.a. the K-T extinction). At that time, about 75% of marine species disappeared. Again, a few well-known types of organisms disappeared altogether, including dinosaurs (but not birds) and the pterosaurs. Other types were badly decimated but survived, and then flourished in the Paleogene. The K-Pg extinction is thought to have been caused by the impact of a large extraterrestrial body (10 km to 15 km across), but it is generally agreed that the other four Phanerozoic extinctions had other causes, although their exact nature is not clearly understood.</p> <p>As already stated, it is no coincidence that the major extinctions all coincide with boundaries of geological periods and even eras. Paleontologists have placed most of the divisions of the geological time scale at points in the fossil record where there are major changes in the type of organisms observed.</p> <p>If we can identify a fossil to the species level, or at least to the genus level, and we know the time period when the organism lived, we can assign a range of time to the rock. That range might be several million years because some organisms survived for a very long time. If the rock we are studying has several types of fossils in it, and we can assign time ranges to those fossils, we might be able to narrow the time range for the age of the rock considerably. An example of this is given in Figure 8.11.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_739" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-739" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/age-of-a-rock.png"><img class="wp-image-739" alt="Figure 8.11 The application of bracketing to constrain the age of a rock based on several fossils.

Sharks, for example, have been around for over 400 million years, and the great white shark has survived for 16 million years, so far. Organisms that lived for relatively short time periods are particularly useful for dating rocks, especially if they were distributed over a wide geographic area and so can be used to compare rocks from different regions. These are known as <strong>index fossils</strong>. There is no specific limit on how short the time span has to be to qualify as an index fossil. Some lived for millions of years, and others for much less than a million years.</p> <p>Some well-studied groups of organisms qualify as <strong>biozone </strong>fossils because, although the genera and families lived over a long time, each species lived for a relatively short time and can be easily distinguished from others on the basis of specific features. For example, ammonites have a distinctive feature known as the <strong>suture</strong> line — where the internal shell layers that separate the individual chambers (<strong>septae</strong>) meet the outer shell wall, as shown in Figure 8.12. These suture lines are sufficiently variable to identify species that can be used to estimate the relative or absolute ages of the rocks in which they are found.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_740" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-740" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/septum-of-an-ammonite.png"><img class="wp-image-740" alt="Figure 8.12 The septum of an ammonite (white part, left), and the suture lines where the septae meet the outer shell (right).

It was only in the early part of the 20th century, when isotopic dating methods were first applied, that it became possible to discover the absolute ages of the rocks containing fossils. In most cases, we cannot use isotopic techniques to directly date fossils or the sedimentary rocks they are found in, but we can constrain their ages by dating igneous rocks that cut across sedimentary rocks, or volcanic ash layers that lie within sedimentary layers.</p> <p>Isotopic dating of rocks, or the minerals in them, is based on the fact that we know the decay rates of certain unstable <strong>isotopes</strong> of elements and that these rates have been constant over geological time. It is also based on the premise that when the atoms of an element decay within a mineral or a rock, they stay there and don’t escape to the surrounding rock, water, or air. One of the isotope pairs widely used in geology is the decay of <sup>40</sup>K to <sup>40</sup>Ar (potassium-40 to argon-40). <sup>40</sup>K is a radioactive isotope of potassium that is present in very small amounts in all minerals that have potassium in them. It has a half-life of 1.3 billion years, meaning that over a period of 1.3 Ga one-half of the <sup>40</sup>K atoms in a mineral or rock will decay to <sup>40</sup>Ar, and over the next 1.3 Ga one-half of the remaining atoms will decay, and so on (Figure 8.14).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-285" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/decay-of-40K.png"><img width="300" height="227" class="size-medium wp-image-285" alt="Figure 8.14 The decay of 40K over time.

One good example is granite, which normally has some potassium feldspar (Figure 8.15). Feldspar does not have any argon in it when it forms. Over time, the <sup>40</sup>K in the feldspar decays to <sup>40</sup>Ar. Argon is a gas and the atoms of <sup>40</sup>Ar remain embedded within the crystal, unless the rock is subjected to high temperatures after it forms. The sample must be analyzed using a very sensitive mass-spectrometer, which can detect the differences between the masses of atoms, and can therefore distinguish between <sup>40</sup>K and the much more abundant <sup>39</sup>K. Biotite and hornblende are also commonly used for K-Ar dating.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_744" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-744" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Crystals-of-potassium-feldspar.jpg"><img width="400" height="256" class="wp-image-744" alt="Figure 8.15 Crystals of potassium feldspar (pink) in a granitic rock are candidates for isotopic dating using the K-Ar method because they contained potassium and no argon when they formed.

A clastic sedimentary rock is made up of older rock and mineral fragments, and when the rock forms it is almost certain that all of the fragments already have daughter isotopes in them. Furthermore, in almost all cases, the fragments have come from a range of source rocks that all formed at different times. If we dated a number of individual grains in the sedimentary rock, we would likely get a range of different dates, all older than the age of the rock. It might be possible to date some chemical sedimentary rocks isotopically, but there are no useful isotopes that can be used on old chemical sedimentary rocks.

The longest such records can take us back over 25 ka, to the height of the last glaciation. One of the advantages of dendrochronology is that, providing reliable reference records are available, the technique can be used to date events to the nearest year.</p> <p>Dendrochronology has been used to date the last major subduction zone earthquake on the coast of B.C., Washington, and Oregon. When large earthquakes strike in this setting, there is a tendency for some coastal areas to subside by one or two metres. Seawater then rushes in, flooding coastal flats and killing trees and other vegetation within a few months. There are at least four locations along the coast of Washington that have such dead trees (and probably many more in other areas). Wood samples from these trees have been studied and the ring patterns have been compared with patterns from old living trees in the region (Figure 8.17).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_748" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-748" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/tree-ring-dating.png"><img class="wp-image-748" alt="Figure 8.17 Example of tree-ring dating of dead trees [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/tree-ring-dating.png" height="125" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-748">Figure 8.17 Example of tree-ring dating of dead trees [SE]</div></div> <p>At all of the locations studied, the trees were found to have died either in the year 1699, or very shortly thereafter (Figure 8.18).

Evidence from a major tsunami that struck Japan on January 27, 1700, narrowed the timing of the earthquake to sometime in the evening of January 26, 1700.

The magnetic field makes compasses point toward the North Pole, but, as we’ll see in Chapter 10, this hasn’t always been the case. At various times in the past, Earth’s magnetic field has reversed itself completely, and during those times a compass would have pointed to the South Pole. By studying magnetism in volcanic rocks that have been dated isotopically, geologists have been able to delineate the chronology of magnetic field reversals going back for some 250 Ma. About 5 Ma of this record is shown in Figure 8.19, where the black bands represent periods of normal magnetism (“normal” meaning similar to the current magnetic field) and the white bands represent periods of reversed magnetism. These periods of consistent magnetic polarity are given names to make them easier to reference. The current normal magnetic field, known as Brunhes, has lasted for the past 780,000 years. Prior to that there was a short reversed period and then a short normal period known as Jaramillo.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-750" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/magnetic-field-reversals.png"><img class="wp-image-750" alt="Figure 8.19 The last 5 Ma of magnetic field reversals.

By carefully matching the sea-floor magnetic stripes with the known magnetic chronology, we can determine the age at any point on the plate. We can see, for example, that the oldest part of the Juan de Fuca Plate that has not subducted (off the coast of Oregon) is just over 8 million years old, while the part that is subducting underneath Vancouver Island is between 0 and about 6 million years old.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_752" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-752" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/pattern-of-magnetism.png"><img class="wp-image-752" alt="Figure 8.21 The pattern of magnetism within the area of the Juan de Fuca Plate, off the west coast of North America.

The problem is that our lives are short and our memories are even shorter. Our experiences span only a few decades, so we really don’t have a way of knowing what 11,700 years means. What’s more, it’s hard for us to understand how 11,700 years differs from 65.5 Ma, or even from 1.8 Ga. It’s not that we can’t comprehend what the numbers mean — we can all get that figured out with a bit of practice — but even if we do know the numerical meaning of 65.5 Ma, we can’t really appreciate how long ago it was.</p> <p>You may be wondering why it’s so important to really “understand” geological time. There are some very good reasons. One is so that we can fully understand how geological processes that seem impossibly slow can produce anything of consequence. For example, we are familiar with the concept of driving from one major city to another: a journey of several hours at around 100 km/h. Continents move toward each other at rates of a fraction of a millimetre per day, or something in the order of 0.00000001 km/h, and yet, at this impossibly slow rate (try walking at that speed!), they can move thousands of kilometres. Sediments typically accumulate at even slower rates — less than a millimetre per year — but still they are thick enough to be thrust up into monumental mountains and carved into breathtaking canyons.</p> <p>Another reason is that for our survival on this planet, we need to understand issues like extinction of endangered species and <strong>anthropogenic</strong> (human-caused) climate change. Some people, who don’t understand geological time, are quick to say that the climate has changed in the past, and that what is happening now is no different. And it certainly has changed in the past. For example, from the Eocene (50 Ma) to the present day, Earth’s climate cooled by about 12°C. That’s a huge change that ranks up there with many of the important climate changes of the distant past, and yet the rate of change over that time was only 0.000024°C/century. Anthropogenic climate change has been 1.1°C over the past 100 years,<span class="footnote">Climate change data from NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts.txt</span> and that is 45,800 times faster than the rate of natural climate change since the Eocene!</p> <p>One way to wrap your mind around geological time is to put it into the perspective of single year, because we all know how long it is from one birthday to the next. At that rate, each hour of the year is equivalent to approximately 500,000 years, and each day is equivalent to 12.5 million years.</p> <p>If all of geological time is compressed down to a single year, Earth formed on January 1, and the first life forms evolved in late March (~3,500 Ma). The first large life forms appeared on November 13 (~600 Ma), plants appeared on land around November 24, and amphibians on December 3. Reptiles evolved from amphibians during the first week of December and dinosaurs and early mammals evolved from reptiles by December 13, but the dinosaurs, which survived for 160 million years, were gone by Boxing Day (December 26). The Pleistocene Glaciation got started at around 6:30 p.m. on New Year’s Eve, and the last glacial ice left southern Canada by 11:59 p.m.</p> <p>It’s worth repeating: on this time scale, the earliest ancestors of the animals and plants with which we are familiar did not appear on Earth until mid-November, the dinosaurs disappeared after Christmas, and most of Canada was periodically locked in ice from 6:30 to 11:59 p.m. on New Year’s Eve. As for people, the first to inhabit B.C. got here about one minute before midnight, and the first Europeans arrived about two seconds before midnight.</p> <p>It is common for the popular press to refer to distant past events as being “prehistoric.” For example, dinosaurs are reported as being “prehistoric creatures,” even by the esteemed National Geographic Society.<span class="footnote">http://science.nationalgeographic.com/science/prehistoric-world/</span> The written records of our history date back to about 6,000 years ago, so anything prior to that is considered “prehistoric.” But to call the dinosaurs prehistoric is equivalent to — and about as useful as — saying that Singapore is beyond the city limits of Kamloops! If we are going to become literate about geological time, we have to do better than calling dinosaurs, or early horses (54 Ma), or even early humans (2.8 Ma), “prehistoric.”</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 8.5 </strong><strong>What Happened on Your Birthday?</strong></p> <p>Using the “all of geological time compressed to one year” concept, determine the geological date that is equivalent to your birthday.

We have a variety of ways of knowing, and these will be discussed in this chapter, but the one thing we can’t do is go down and look! Fortunately there are a few places where mantle rock is exposed on Earth’s surface, and we have some samples of material from the insides of other planetary bodies, in the form of meteorites that have landed on Earth (Figure 9.1). We also have a great deal of seismic information that can help us understand the nature of Earth’s interior.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-472" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/meteorite.png"><img class="wp-image-472" alt="meteorite" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/meteorite-300x124.png" width="400" height="165" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-472">Figure 9.1 Left: a fragment of the Tagish Lake meteorite, discovered in 2000 on the ice of Tagish Lake, B.C.

The crust is primarily (~95%) made up of igneous rock and metamorphic rock with an overall composition between intermediate and felsic. The remaining 5% is made up of sedimentary rock, which is dominated by mudstone.</p> <p>The mantle includes several layers, all with the same overall ultramafic composition. The upper mantle is typically composed of peridotite, a rock dominated by olivine and pyroxene. The lower mantle has a similar chemical composition, but because of the extreme pressures, different minerals are present, including spinels and garnets. The properties of the mantle also vary with depth, as follows:</p> <ul><li><strong>Lithosphere</strong>: solid</li> <li><strong>Asthenosphere</strong>: partially liquid</li> <li>Upper and lower mantle: solid but plastic (the difference between the two is in the type of minerals)</li> <li><strong>“D&#8221; layer</strong> (the part of the mantle within 200 km of the core): partially liquid</li> <li>The <strong>core-mantle boundary</strong> (CMB) is at a depth of 2,900 km.</li> </ul> <p>The core is primarily composed of iron, with lesser amounts of nickel (about 5%) and several percent oxygen. It is extremely hot (~3500° to 5000°C). The outer core is liquid while the inner core is solid — even though it is hotter — because the pressure is so much greater at that depth.</p> <p>Although the CMB is a little less than half of the way to Earth’s centre, the mantle, being on the outside, is by far the major component of Earth. The mantle makes up 82.5% of the volume, the core 16.1%, and the crust only 1.4%.</p> <p>In the remainder of this chapter, we’ll look first at how we know about Earth’s interior structure, and then at the properties of the different layers and the processes that take place within them.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_960" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-960" style="width: 89px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/9-earth-interior.png"><img class="size-medium wp-image-960" alt="Figure 9.2 Earth’s layers: crust is pink, mantle is green, core is blue [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/9-earth-interior-89x300.png" width="89" height="300" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-960">Figure 9.2 Earth’s layers: crust is pink, mantle is green, core is blue [SE]</div></div></div>

These vibrations are caused by various events, including earthquakes, extraterrestrial impacts, explosions, storm waves hitting the shore, and tidal effects. Of course, seismic techniques have been most widely applied to the detection and study of earthquakes, but there are many other applications, and arguably seismic waves provide the most important information that we have concerning Earth’s interior. Before going any deeper into Earth, however, we need to take a look at the properties of seismic waves. The types of waves that are useful for understanding Earth’s interior are called <strong>body waves</strong>, meaning that, unlike the surface waves on the ocean, they are transmitted through Earth materials.</p> <p>Imagine hitting a large block of strong rock (e.g., granite) with a heavy sledgehammer (Figure 9.3). At the point where the hammer strikes it, a small part of the rock will be compressed by a fraction of a millimetre. That compression will transfer to the neighbouring part of the rock, and so on through to the far side of the rock, from where it will bounce back to the top — all in a fraction of a second. This is known as a compression wave, and it can be illustrated by holding a loose spring (like a Slinky) that is attached to something (or someone) at the other end. If you give it a sharp push so the coils are compressed, the compression propagates (travels) along the length of the spring and back (Figure 9.4). You can think of a compression wave as a “push” wave — it’s called a <strong>P-wave</strong> (although the “P” stands for “primary” because P-waves arrive first at seismic stations).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_476" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-476" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0071.png"><img width="400" height="307" class="wp-image-476" alt="Hitting a large block of rock with a heavy hammer will create seismic waves within the rock.

[SE]</div></div> <p>When we hit a rock with a hammer, we also create a different type of body wave, one that is characterized by back-and-forth vibrations (as opposed to compressions). This is known as a shear wave (<strong>S-wave</strong>, where the “S” stands for “secondary”), and an analogy would be what happens when you flick a length of rope with an up-and-down motion. As shown in Figure 9.4, a wave will form in the rope, which will travel to the end of the rope and back.</p> <p>Compression waves and shear waves travel very quickly through geological materials. As shown in Figure 9.5, typical P-wave velocities are between 0.5 km/s and 2.5 km/s in unconsolidated sediments, and between 3.0 km/s and 6.5 km/s in solid crustal rocks. Of the common rocks of the crust, velocities are greatest in basalt and granite. S-waves are slower than P-waves, with velocities between 0.1 km/s and 0.8 km/s in soft sediments, and between 1.5 km/s and 3.8 km/s in solid rocks.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-477" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0091.png"><img width="400" height="267" class="wp-image-477" alt="A compression wave can be illustrated by a spring (like a Slinky) that is given a sharp push at one end.

The rate of change of seismic waves with depth in Earth (as shown in Figure 9.6) has been determined over the past several decades by analyzing seismic signals from large earthquakes at seismic stations around the world.

He reasoned that the waves that went down into the mantle, travelled through the mantle, and then were bent upward back into the crust, reached the seismic station first because although they had farther to go, they travelled faster through mantle rock (as shown in Figure 9.7). The boundary between the crust and the mantle is known as the <strong>Mohorovičić discontinuity</strong> (or Moho). Its depth is between 60 km and 80 km beneath major mountain ranges, around 30 km to 50 km beneath most of the continental crust, and between 5 km and 10 km beneath the oceanic crust.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_962" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-962" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/moho.png"><img width="300" height="71" class="size-medium wp-image-962" alt="Figure 9.7 Depiction of seismic waves emanating from an earthquake (red star).

[SE]</div></div> <p>Our current understanding of the patterns of seismic wave transmission through Earth is summarized in Figure 9.8. Because of the gradual increase in density (and therefore rock strength) with depth, all waves are refracted (toward the lower density material) as they travel through homogenous parts of Earth and thus tend to curve outward toward the surface. Waves are also refracted at boundaries within Earth, such as at the Moho, at the core-mantle boundary (CMB), and at the outer-core/inner-core boundary.</p> <p>S-waves do not travel through liquids — they are stopped at the CMB — and there is an S-wave shadow on the side of Earth opposite a seismic source. The angular distance from the seismic source to the shadow zone is 103° on either side, so the total angular distance of the shadow zone is 154°. We can use this information to infer the depth to the CMB.</p> <p>P-waves do travel through liquids, so they can make it through the liquid part of the core. Because of the refraction that takes place at the CMB, waves that travel through the core are bent away from the surface, and this creates a P-wave shadow zone on either side, from 103° to 150°. This information can be used to discover the differences between the inner and outer parts of the core.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_964" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-964" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/shadow-2.png"><img width="300" height="141" class="size-medium wp-image-964" alt="Figure 9.8 Patterns of seismic wave propagation through Earth’s mantle and core.

Within the depth interval between 100 and 250 km, the temperature curve comes very close to the melting boundary for dry mantle rock. At these depths, therefore, mantle rock is either very nearly melted or partially melted. In some situations, where extra heat is present and the temperature line crosses over the melting line, or where water is present, it may be completely molten. This region of the mantle is known as the low-velocity zone because seismic waves are slowed within rock that is near its melting point, and of course it is also known as the asthenosphere. Below 250 km, the temperature stays on the left side of the melting line; in other words, the mantle is solid from here all the way down to the core-mantle boundary.<strong> </strong></p> <p>The fact that the temperature gradient is much less in the main part of the mantle than in the lithosphere has been interpreted to indicate that the mantle is convecting, and therefore that heat from depth is being brought toward the surface faster than it would be with only heat conduction. As we’ll see in Chapter 10, a convecting mantle is an essential feature of plate tectonics.</p> <p>The convection of the mantle is a product of the transfer of heat from the core to the lower mantle. As in a pot of soup on a hot stove (Figure 9.12), the material near the heat source becomes hot and expands, making it lighter than the material above. The force of buoyancy causes it to rise, and cooler material flows in from the sides. The mantle convects in this way because the heat transfer from below is not perfectly even, and also because, even though mantle material is solid rock, it is sufficiently plastic to slowly flow (at rates of centimetres per year) as long as a steady force is applied to it.</p> <p>As in the soup pot example, Earth’s mantle will no longer convect once the core has cooled to the point where there is not enough heat transfer to overcome the strength of the rock. This has already happened on smaller planets like Mercury and Mars, as well as on Earth’s Moon.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-491" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0311.png"><img width="400" height="144" class="wp-image-491" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0311.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-491">Figure 9.12 Convection in a pot of soup on a hot stove (left).

Because iron is a metal and conducts electricity (even when molten), its motion generates a magnetic field.</p> <p>Earth’s magnetic field is defined by the North and South Poles that align generally with the axis of rotation (Figure 9.13). The lines of magnetic force flow into Earth in the northern hemisphere and out of Earth in the southern hemisphere. Because of the shape of the field lines, the magnetic force trends at different angles to the surface in different locations (red arrows of Figure 9.13). At the North and South Poles, the force is vertical. Anywhere on the equator the force is horizontal, and everywhere in between, the magnetic force is at some intermediate angle to the surface. As we’ll see in Chapter 10, the variations in these orientations provide a critical piece of evidence to the understanding of continental drift as an aspect of plate tectonics.</p> <p>Earth’s magnetic field is generated within the outer core by the convective movement of liquid iron, but as we discovered in Chapter 8, the magnetic field is not stable over geological time. For reasons that are not completely understood, the magnetic field decays periodically and then becomes re-established. When it does re-establish, it may be oriented the way it was before the decay, or it may be oriented with the reversed polarity. Over the past 250 Ma, there have a few hundred magnetic field reversals, and their timing has been anything but regular.

The fact that field reversals took place shows that the model is a reasonably accurate representation of the Earth. According to the lead author of the study, Gary Glatzmaier, of University of California Santa Cruz: “Our solution shows how convection in the fluid outer core is continually trying to reverse the field but that the solid inner core inhibits magnetic reversals because the field in the inner core can only change on the much longer time scale of diffusion. Only once in many attempts is a reversal successful, which is probably the reason why the times between reversals of the Earth&#8217;s field are long and randomly distributed.” A depiction of Earth’s magnetic field lines during a stable period and during a reversal is shown in Figure 9.15.

The literal meaning of the word isostasy is “equal standstill,” but the importance behind it is the principle that Earth’s crust is <em>floating</em> on the mantle, like a raft floating in the water, rather than <em>resting</em> on the mantle like a raft sitting on the ground.</p> <p>The relationship between the crust and the mantle is illustrated in Figure 9.16. On the right is an example of a non-isostatic relationship between a raft and solid concrete. It’s possible to load the raft up with lots of people, and it still won’t sink into the concrete. On the left, the relationship is an isostatic one between two different rafts and a swimming pool full of peanut butter. With only one person on board, the raft floats high in the peanut butter, but with three people, it sinks dangerously low. We’re using peanut butter here, rather than water, because its viscosity more closely represents the relationship between the crust and the mantle. Although it has about the same density as water, peanut butter is much more viscous (stiff), and so although the three-person raft will sink into the peanut butter, it will do so quite slowly.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-498" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image041.png"><img width="400" height="99" class="wp-image-498" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image041.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-498">Figure 9.16 Illustration of a non-isostatic relationship between a raft and solid ground (right) and of isostatic relationships between rafts and peanut butter (left).

The raft with one person on it floats comfortably high. Even with three people on it the raft is less dense than the peanut butter, so it floats, but it floats uncomfortably low for those three people. The crust, with an average density of around 2.6 grams per cubic centimetre (g/cm3), is less dense than the mantle (average density of approximately 3.4 g/cm3 near the surface, but more than that at depth), and so it is floating on the “plastic” mantle. When more weight is added to the crust, through the process of mountain building, it slowly sinks deeper into the mantle and the mantle material that was there is pushed aside (Figure 9.17, left). When that weight is removed by erosion over tens of millions of years, the crust rebounds and the mantle rock flows back (Figure 9.17, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_963" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-963" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/rebound-2.png"><img width="300" height="100" class="size-medium wp-image-963" alt="Figure 9.17 Illustration of the isostatic relationship between the crust and the mantle.

The explanation is that the mantle behaves as a non-Newtonian fluid, meaning that it responds differently to stresses depending on how quickly the stress is applied. A good example of this is the behaviour of the material known as Silly Putty, which can bounce and will break if you pull on it sharply, but will deform in a liquid manner if stress is applied slowly. In this photo, Silly Putty was placed over a hole in a glass tabletop, and in response to gravity, it slowly flowed into the hole. The mantle will flow when placed under the slow but steady stress of a growing (or melting) ice sheet.</p> <p>[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f3/Silly_putty_dripping.jpg]</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_505" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-505" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image055.png"><img width="300" height="206" class="wp-image-505" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image055.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-505">Figure 9.19  The current rates of post-glacial isostatic uplift (green, blue, and purple shades) and subsidence (yellow and orange).

More specifically it is a model that explains the origins of continents and oceans, folded rocks and mountain ranges, igneous and metamorphic rocks, earthquakes and volcanoes, and continental drift. Plate tectonics was first proposed just over 100 years ago, but did not become an accepted part of geology until about 50 years ago. It took 50 years for this theory to become accepted for a few reasons. First, it was a true revolution in thinking about Earth, which was difficult for many established geologists. Second, there was a political gulf between the main proponent of the theory Alfred Wegener (from Germany) and the geological establishment of the day, which was mostly centred in Britain and the United States. Third, the evidence and understanding of Earth that would have supported plate tectonic theory simply didn’t exist until the middle of the 20th century.</p></div>

He relied heavily on matching geological patterns across oceans, such as sedimentary strata in South America matching those in Africa (Figure 10.3), North American coalfields matching those in Europe, and the mountains of Atlantic Canada matching those of northern Britain — both in morphology and rock type. Wegener also referred to the evidence for the Carboniferous and Permian (~300 Ma) Karoo Glaciation in South America, Africa, India, Antarctica, and Australia (Figure 10.4). He argued that this could only have happened if these continents were once all connected as a single supercontinent. He also cited evidence (based on his own astronomical observations) that showed that the continents were moving with respect to each other, and determined a separation rate between Greenland and Scandinavia of 11 m per year, although he admitted that the measurements were not accurate.

He revised this book several times up to 1929. It was translated into French, English, Spanish, and Russian in 1924.</p> <p>In fact the continental fits were not perfect and the geological matchups were not always consistent, but the most serious problem of all was that Wegener could not conceive of a good mechanism for moving the continents around. It was understood by this time that the continents were primarily composed of <strong>sialic</strong> material (<strong>SIAL</strong>: silicon and aluminum dominated), and that the ocean floors were primarily <strong>simatic</strong> (<strong>SIMA</strong>: silicon and magnesium dominated). Wegener proposed that the continents were like icebergs floating on the heavier SIMA crust, but the only forces that he could invoke to propel continents around were <em>poleflucht</em><em>,</em> the effect of Earth&#8217;s rotation pushing objects toward the equator, and the lunar and solar tidal forces, which tend to push objects toward the west. It was quickly shown that these forces were far too weak to move continents, and without any reasonable mechanism to make it work, Wegener’s theory was quickly dismissed by most geologists of the day.</p> <p>Alfred Wegener died in Greenland in 1930 while carrying out studies related to glaciation and climate. At the time of his death, his ideas were tentatively accepted by only a small minority of geologists, and soundly rejected by most. However, within a few decades that was all to change.

One of those was explaining the distribution of terrestrial species across five continents that are currently separated by hundreds or thousands of kilometres of ocean water (Figure 10.2), and another was explaining the origin of extensive fold-belt mountains, such as the Appalachians, the Alps, the Himalayas, and the Canadian Rockies.</p> <p>Before we go any further, it is important to know what was generally believed about global geology before plate tectonics. At the beginning of the 20th century, geologists had a good understanding of how most rocks were formed and understood their relative ages through interpretation of fossils, but there was considerable controversy regarding the origin of mountain chains, especially fold-belt mountains. At the end of the 19th century, one of the prevailing views on the origin of mountains was the theory of <strong>contractionism</strong> — the idea that since Earth is slowly cooling, it must also be shrinking. In this scenario, mountain ranges had formed like the wrinkles on a dried-up apple, and the oceans had submerged parts of former continents. While this theory helped to address the dilemma of the terrestrial fossils, it came with its own set of problems, one being that the amount of cooling couldn’t produce the necessary amount of shrinking, and the other being the principle of isostasy (which had already been around for several decades), which wouldn’t allow continents to sink. (See Section 9.4 for a review of the important principle of isostasy.)</p> <p>Another widely held view was <strong>permanentism</strong>, in which it was believed that the continents and oceans have always been generally as they are today. This view incorporated a mechanism for creation of mountain chains known as the <strong>geosyncline</strong> theory. A geosyncline is a thick deposit of sediments and sedimentary rocks, typically situated along the edge of a continent (Figure 10.5).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_542" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-542" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0092.png"><img class="wp-image-542" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0092.png" height="458" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-542">Figure 10.5 The development of a geosyncline along a continental margin. (Note that a geosyncline is not related to a syncline, which is a downward fold in sedimentary rocks.) [SE]</div></div> <p>The idea of geosynclines developing into fold-belt mountains originated in the middle of the 19th century, proposed first by James Hall and later elaborated by Dwight Dana, both of whom worked extensively in the Appalachian Mountains of the eastern United States. The process of converting a geosyncline into a mountain belt was never really adequately explained, although it was widely believed that mountain belts formed when geosynclines were compressed by forces pushing from either side. The problem is that, without the lateral forces related to plate tectonics, no one was able to adequately describe what would do the pushing. The sediments that accumulate within a geosyncline are derived from erosion of the adjacent continent. Geosynclinal sediments — which eventually turn into sedimentary rocks — may be many thousands of metres thick. As they accumulate, they push down the pre-existing crustal rocks. Extensive geosynclinal deposits exist around much of the coastline of most of the continents; there is a large geosyncline along the eastern edge of North America.</p> <p>Proponents of the geosyncline theory of mountain formation, and there were many well into the 1960s, also had the problem of explaining the intercontinental terrestrial fossil matchups. The simple explanation was that there were “land bridges” across the Atlantic along which animals and plants could migrate back and forth. One proponent of this idea was the American naturalist Ernest Ingersoll. Referring to evidence of past climate changes, Ingersoll contributed the following to the <em>Encyclopedia Americana</em> in 1920: “The most interesting feature of these changes, however, is that by which, now and again, the Old World was connected with the New by necks or spaces of land, known as “land-bridges”; especially as these permitted an interchange of plants and animals, giving to us many new ones from the other side of the ocean, including, finally, man himself.”<span class="footnote">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Encyclopedia_Americana_(1920)/Land-Bridges_Across_the_Oceans</span></p> <p>There are many problems with the land-bridge theory, one being that it is completely inconsistent with isostasy, and another that there is no evidence of the remnants of the land bridges. The Atlantic Ocean is several thousand metres deep over wide areas, and so the underwater slopes leading up to a land bridge would have to have been at least tens of kilometres wide in most places, and many times that in others. A land bridge of that size would certainly have left some trace.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 10.1 </strong><strong>Fitting the Continents Together </strong></p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-543"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0111.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-543" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0111.png" height="344" width="400" alt="image" /></a></div> <p>The main continents around the Atlantic Ocean are depicted here in the shapes that they might have had during the Mesozoic, including the extents of their continental shelves.

This is called <strong>remnant magnetism</strong>. Rocks like basalt, which cool from a high temperature and commonly have relatively high levels of magnetite, are particularly susceptible to being magnetized in this way, but even sediments and sedimentary rocks, as long as they have small amounts of magnetite, will take on remnant magnetism because the magnetite grains gradually become reoriented following deposition. By studying both the horizontal and vertical components of the remnant magnetism, one can tell not only the direction to magnetic north at the time of the rock&#8217;s formation, but also the latitude where the rock formed relative to magnetic north.</p> <p>In the early 1950s, a group of geologists from Cambridge University, including Keith Runcorn, Ted Irving,<span class="footnote">Ted Irving later set up a paleomagnetic lab at the Geological Survey of Canada in Sidney, B.C., and did a great deal of important work on understanding the geology of western North America.</span> and several others, started looking at the remnant magnetism of Phanerozoic British and European volcanic rocks, and collecting <strong>paleomagnetic</strong> data. They found that rocks of different ages sampled from generally the same area showed quite different apparent magnetic pole positions (Figure 10.6). They initially assumed that this meant that Earth&#8217;s magnetic field had, over time, departed significantly from its present position — which is close to the rotational pole.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_544" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-544" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0131.png"><img width="400" height="199" class="wp-image-544" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0131.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-544">Figure 10.6 Apparent polar-wandering paths (APWP) for Eurasia and North America.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The curve defined by the paleomagnetic data was called a <strong>polar wandering path</strong> because Runcorn and his students initially thought that their data represented actual movement of the magnetic poles (since geophysical models of the time suggested that the magnetic poles did not need to be aligned with the rotational poles). We now know that the magnetic data define movement of continents, and <em>not</em> of the magnetic poles, so we call it an <em>apparent</em> polar wandering path (APWP).</p> <h3>What is a polar wandering path?</h3> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0151.png"><img width="250" height="266" class="aligncenter wp-image-545" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0151.png" /></a></p> <p>At around 500 Ma, what we now call Europe was south of the equator, and so European rocks formed then would have acquired an upward-pointing magnetic field orientation (see Figure 9.13 and the figure shown here). Between then and now, Europe gradually moved north, and the rocks forming at various times acquired steeper and steeper <em>downward-pointing</em> magnetic orientations.</p> <p>When researchers evaluated magnetic data in this way in the 1950s, they plotted where the North Pole would have appeared to be based on the magnetic data and assumed that the continent was always where it is now. That means that the 500 Ma “apparent” north pole would have been somewhere in the South Pacific, and that over the following 500 million years it would have gradually moved north.</p> <p>Of course we now know that the magnetic poles don’t move around much (although polarity reversals do take place) and that the reason Europe had a magnetic orientation characteristic of the southern hemisphere is that it was in the southern hemisphere at 500 Ma.</p> <p>Runcorn and colleagues soon extended their work to North America, and this also showed <em>apparent</em> polar wandering, but the results were not consistent with those from Europe. For example, the 200 Ma pole for North America plotted somewhere in China, while the 200 Ma pole for Europe plotted in the Pacific Ocean. Since there could only have been one pole position at 200 Ma, this evidence strongly supported the idea that North America and Europe had moved relative to each other since 200 Ma. Subsequent paleomagnetic work showed that South America, Africa, India, and Australia also have unique polar wandering curves. In 1956, Runcorn changed his mind and became a proponent of continental drift.</p> <p>This paleomagnetic work of the 1950s was the first new evidence in favour of continental drift, and it led a number of geologists to start thinking that the idea might have some merit. Nevertheless, for a majority of geologists working on global geology at the time, this type of evidence was not sufficiently convincing to get them to change their views.</p> <p>During the 20th century, our knowledge and understanding of the ocean basins and their geology increased dramatically. Before 1900, we knew virtually nothing about the bathymetry and geology of the oceans. By the end of the 1960s, we had detailed maps of the topography of the ocean floors, a clear picture of the geology of ocean floor sediments and the solid rocks underneath them, and almost as much information about the geophysical nature of ocean rocks as of continental rocks.</p> <p>Up until about the 1920s, ocean depths were measured using weighted lines dropped overboard. In deep water this is a painfully slow process and the number of soundings in the deep oceans was probably fewer than 1,000. That is roughly one depth sounding for every 350,000 square kilometres of the ocean. To put that in perspective, it would be like trying to describe the topography of British Columbia with elevation data for only a half a dozen points! The voyage of the <em>Challenger</em> in 1872 and the laying of trans-Atlantic cables had shown that there were mountains beneath the seas, but most geologists and oceanographers still believed that the oceans were essentially vast basins with flat bottoms, filled with thousands of metres of sediments.</p> <p>Following development of acoustic depth sounders in the 1920s (Figure 10.7), the number of depth readings increased by many orders of magnitude, and by the 1930s, it had become apparent that there were major mountain chains in all of the world&#8217;s oceans. During and after World War II, there was a well-organized campaign to study the oceans, and by 1959, sufficient bathymetric data had been collected to produce detailed maps of all the oceans (Figure 10.8).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_546" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-546" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0171.png"><img width="400" height="182" class="wp-image-546" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0171.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-546">Figure 10.7 Depiction of a ship-borne acoustic depth sounder.

As the technique evolved, and the amount of energy was increased, it became possible to <em>see through</em> the sea-floor sediments and map the bedrock topography and crustal thickness. Hence sediment thicknesses could be mapped, and it was soon discovered that although the sediments were up to several thousands of metres thick near the continents, they were relatively thin — or even non-existent — in the ocean ridge areas (Figure 10.9). The seismic studies also showed that the crust is relatively thin under the oceans (5 km to 6 km) compared to the continents (30 km to 60 km) and geologically very consistent, composed almost entirely of basalt.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_550" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-550" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image023_2.png"><img width="400" height="80" class="wp-image-550" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image023_2.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-550">Figure 10.9 Topographic section at an ocean ridge based on reflection seismic data.

Bullard and colleagues found the rate to be higher than average along the ridges, and lower than average in the trench areas. Although Bullard was a plate-tectonics sceptic, these features were interpreted to indicate that there is convection within the mantle — the areas of high heat flow being correlated with upward convection of hot mantle material, and the areas of low heat flow being correlated with downward convection.</p> <p>With developments of networks of seismographic stations in the 1950s, it became possible to plot the locations <em>and</em> depths of both major and minor earthquakes with great accuracy. It was found that there is a remarkable correspondence between earthquakes and both the mid-ocean ridges and the deep ocean trenches. In 1954 Gutenberg and Richter showed that the ocean-ridge earthquakes were all relatively shallow, and confirmed what had first been shown by Benioff in the 1930s — that earthquakes in the vicinity of ocean trenches were both shallow and deep, but that the deeper ones were situated progressively farther inland from the trenches (Figure 10.10).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-551" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0251.png"><img width="400" height="98" class="wp-image-551" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0251.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-551">Figure 10.10 Cross-section through the Aleutian subduction zone with a depiction of the increasing depth of earthquakes “inshore” from the trench.

The first comprehensive magnetic data set was compiled in 1958 for an area off the coast of B.C. and Washington State. This survey revealed a bewildering pattern of low and high magnetic intensity in sea-floor rocks (Figure 10.11). When the data were first plotted on a map in 1961, nobody understood them — not even the scientists who collected them. Although the patterns made even less sense than the stripes on a zebra, many thousands of kilometres of magnetic surveys were conducted over the next several years.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_976" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-976" style="width: 255px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/raff-mason.gif"><img width="255" height="222" class="size-full wp-image-976" alt="Figure 10.11 Pattern of sea-floor magnetism off of the west coast of British Columbia and Washington [SE after http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/noca/nocageol4c.html, adapted from: Raff, A and Mason, R, 1961, Magnetic survey off the west coast of North America, 40˚ N to 52˚ N latitude, Geol.

In 1960, Harold Hess, a widely respected geologist from Princeton University, advanced a theory with many of the elements that we now accept as <strong>plate tectonics</strong>. He maintained some uncertainty about his proposal however, and in order to deflect criticism from mainstream geologists, he labelled it <em>geopoetry</em>. In fact, until 1962, Hess didn&#8217;t even put his ideas in writing — except internally to the U.S. Navy (which funded his research) — but presented them mostly in lectures and seminars. Hess proposed that new sea floor was generated from mantle material at the ocean ridges, and that old sea floor was dragged down at the ocean trenches and re-incorporated into the mantle. He suggested that the process was driven by mantle convection currents, rising at the ridges and descending at the trenches (Figure 10.12). He also suggested that the less-dense continental crust did not descend with oceanic crust into trenches, but that colliding land masses were thrust up to form mountains. Hess&#8217;s theory formed the basis for our ideas on <strong>sea-floor spreading</strong> and <strong>continental drift,</strong> but it did not deal with the concept that the crust is made up of specific <strong>plates</strong>. Although the Hess model was not roundly criticized, it was not widely accepted (especially in the U.S.), partly because it was not well supported by hard evidence.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-553" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0291.png"><img width="400" height="159" class="wp-image-553" alt="image" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0291.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-553">Figure 10.12 A representation of Harold Hess’s model for sea-floor spreading and subduction [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Collection of magnetic data from the oceans continued in the early 1960s, but still nobody could explain the origin of the zebra-like patterns. Most assumed that they were related to variations in the composition of the rocks — such as variations in the amount of magnetite — as this is a common explanation for magnetic variations in rocks of the continental crust. The first real understanding of the significance of the striped anomalies was the interpretation by Fred Vine, a Cambridge graduate student. Vine was examining magnetic data from the Indian Ocean and, like others before, he noted the symmetry of the magnetic patterns with respect to the oceanic ridge.</p> <p>At the same time, other researchers, led by groups in California and New Zealand, were studying the phenomenon of reversals in Earth&#8217;s magnetic field. They were trying to determine when such reversals had taken place over the past several million years by analyzing the magnetic characteristics of hundreds of samples from basaltic flows. As discussed in Chapter 9, it is evident that Earth’s magnetic field becomes weakened periodically and then virtually non-existent, before becoming re-established with the reverse polarity. During periods of reversed polarity, a compass would point south instead of north.</p> <p>The time scale of magnetic reversals is irregular. For example, the present &#8220;normal&#8221; event, known as the Bruhnes magnetic chron, has persisted for about 780,000 years. This was preceded by a 190,000-year reversed event; a 50,000-year normal event known as Jaramillo; and then a 700,000-year reversed event (see Figure 9.15).</p> <p>In a paper published in September 1963, Vine and his PhD supervisor Drummond Matthews proposed that the patterns associated with ridges were related to the magnetic reversals, and that oceanic crust created from cooling basalt during a <em>normal</em> event would have polarity aligned with the present magnetic field, and thus would produce a positive anomaly (a black stripe on the sea-floor magnetic map), whereas oceanic crust created during a <em>reversed</em> event would have polarity opposite to the present field and thus would produce a negative magnetic anomaly (a white stripe). The same idea had been put forward a few months earlier by Lawrence Morley, of the Geological Survey of Canada; however, his papers submitted earlier in 1963 to <em>Nature</em> and <em>The Journal of Geophysical Research</em> were rejected. Many people refer to the idea as the Vine-Matthews-Morley (VMM) hypothesis.</p> <p>Vine, Matthews, and Morley were the first to show this type of correspondence between the relative widths of the stripes and the periods of the magnetic reversals. The VMM hypothesis was confirmed within a few years when magnetic data were compiled from spreading ridges around the world. It was shown that the same general magnetic patterns were present straddling each ridge, although the widths of the anomalies varied according to the spreading rates characteristic of the different ridges. It was also shown that the patterns corresponded with the chronology of Earth&#8217;s magnetic field reversals. This global consistency provided strong support for the VMM hypothesis and led to rejection of the other explanations for the magnetic anomalies.</p> <p>In 1963, J. Tuzo Wilson of the University of Toronto proposed the idea of a <strong>mantle plume</strong> or <strong>hot spot </strong>— a place where hot mantle material rises in a stationary and semi-permanent plume, and affects the overlying crust. He based this hypothesis partly on the distribution of the Hawaiian and Emperor Seamount island chains in the Pacific Ocean (Figure 10.13). The volcanic rock making up these islands gets progressively younger toward the southeast, culminating with the island of Hawaii itself, which consists of rock that is almost all younger than 1 Ma. Wilson suggested that a stationary plume of hot upwelling mantle material is the source of the Hawaiian volcanism, and that the ocean crust of the Pacific Plate is moving toward the northwest over this hot spot. Near the Midway Islands, the chain takes a pronounced change in direction, from northwest-southeast for the Hawaiian Islands and to nearly north-south for the Emperor Seamounts. This change is widely ascribed to a change in direction of the Pacific Plate moving over the stationary mantle plume, but a more plausible explanation is that the Hawaiian mantle plume has not actually been stationary throughout its history, and in fact moved at least 2,000 km south over the period between 81 and 45 Ma.<span class="footnote">J.

Fold down the top half where shown, and then pinch together in the middle. Do the same with the bottom half. When you’re done, you should have something like the example below, with two folds of paper extending underneath. Find someone else to pinch those folds with two fingers just below each ridge crest, and then gently pull apart where shown. As you do, the oceanic crust will emerge from the middle, and you’ll see that the parts of the fracture zone between the ridge crests will be moving in opposite directions (this is the transform fault) while the parts of the fracture zone outside of the ridge crests will be moving in the same direction. You’ll also see that the oceanic crust is being magnetized as it forms at the ridge.

By the end of 1967, Earth&#8217;s surface had been mapped into a series of plates (Figure 10.16). The major plates are Eurasia, Pacific, India, Australia, North America, South America, Africa, and Antarctic. There are also numerous small plates (e.g., Juan de Fuca, Nazca, Scotia, Philippine, Caribbean), and many very small plates or sub-plates. For example the Juan de Fuca Plate is actually three separate plates (Gorda, Juan de Fuca, and Explorer) that all move in the same general direction but at slightly different rates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-577" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image043_2.png"><img class="wp-image-577" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image043_2-1024x697.png" height="272" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-577">Figure 10.16 A map showing 15 of the Earth’s tectonic plates and the approximate rates and directions of plate motions.

The Pacific Plate is the fastest at over 10 cm/y in some areas, followed by the Australian and Nazca Plates. The North American Plate is one of the slowest, averaging around 1 cm/y in the south up to almost 4 cm/y in the north.</p> <p>Plates move as rigid bodies, so it may seem surprising that the North American Plate can be moving at different rates in different places. The explanation is that plates move in a rotational manner. The North American Plate, for example, rotates counter-clockwise; the Eurasian Plate rotates clockwise.</p> <p>Boundaries between the plates are of three types: <strong>divergent </strong>(i.e., moving apart)<em>, </em><strong>convergent </strong>(i.e., moving together), and <strong>transform </strong>(moving side by side). Before we talk about processes at plate boundaries, it’s important to point out that there are never gaps between plates. The plates are made up of crust and the lithospheric part of the mantle (Figure 10.17), and even though they are moving all the time, and in different directions, there is never a significant amount of space between them. Plates are thought to move along the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, as the asthenosphere is the zone of partial melting. It is assumed that the relative lack of strength of the partial melting zone facilitates the sliding of the lithospheric plates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-579" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image045_2.png"><img class="wp-image-579" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image045_2.png" height="183" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-579">Figure 10.17 The crust and upper mantle. Tectonic plates consist of lithosphere, which includes the crust and the lithospheric (rigid) part of the mantle. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At spreading centres, the lithospheric mantle may be very thin because the upward convective motion of hot mantle material generates temperatures that are too high for the existence of a significant thickness of rigid lithosphere (Figure 10.12). The fact that the plates include both crustal material and lithospheric mantle material makes it possible for a single plate to be made up of both oceanic and continental crust. For example, the North American Plate includes most of North America, plus half of the northern Atlantic Ocean. Similarly the South American Plate extends across the western part of the southern Atlantic Ocean, while the European and African plates each include part of the eastern Atlantic Ocean. The Pacific Plate is almost entirely oceanic, but it does include the part of California west of the San Andreas Fault.</p> <h1><strong>Divergent Boundaries</strong></h1> <p>Divergent boundaries are spreading boundaries, where new oceanic crust is created from magma derived from partial melting of the mantle caused by decompression as hot mantle rock from depth is moved toward the surface (Figure 10.18). The triangular zone of partial melting near the ridge crest is approximately 60 km thick and the proportion of magma is about 10% of the rock volume, thus producing crust that is about 6 km thick. Most divergent boundaries are located at the oceanic ridges (although some are on land), and the crustal material created at a spreading boundary is always oceanic in character; in other words, it is mafic igneous rock (e.g., basalt or gabbro, rich in ferromagnesian minerals). Spreading rates vary considerably, from 1 cm/y to 3 cm/y in the Atlantic, to between 6 cm/y and 10 cm/y in the Pacific. Some of the processes taking place in this setting include:</p> <ul><li>Magma from the mantle pushing up to fill the voids left by divergence of the two plates</li> <li><strong>Pillow lavas</strong> forming where magma is pushed out into seawater (Figure 10.19)</li> <li><strong>Vertical</strong> sheeted dykes intruding into cracks resulting from the spreading</li> <li>Magma cooling more slowly in the lower part of the new crust and forming gabbro bodies</li> </ul> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_562" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-562" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0471.png"><img class="wp-image-562" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0471.png" height="222" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-562">Figure 10.18 The general processes that take place at a divergent boundary.

The buoyancy of the mantle plume material creates a dome within the crust, causing it to fracture in a radial pattern, with three arms spaced at approximately 120° (Figure 10.20). When a series of mantle plumes exists beneath a large continent, the resulting rifts may align and lead to the formation of a rift valley (such as the present-day Great Rift Valley in eastern Africa). It is suggested that this type of valley eventually develops into a linear sea (such as the present-day Red Sea), and finally into an ocean (such as the Atlantic). It is likely that as many as 20 mantle plumes, many of which still exist, were responsible for the initiation of the rifting of Pangea along what is now the mid-Atlantic ridge (see Figure 10.14).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-535" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/rift-formation.png"><img class="wp-image-535" alt="rift formation" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/rift-formation-e1439319064564.png" height="163" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-535">Figure 10.20 Depiction of the process of dome and three-part rift formation (left) and of continental rifting between the African and South American parts of Pangea at around 200 Ma (right) [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><strong>Convergent Boundaries</strong></h1> <p>Convergent boundaries, where two plates are moving toward each other, are of three types, depending on the type of crust present on either side of the boundary — oceanic or continental. The types are ocean-ocean, ocean-continent, and continent-continent.</p> <p>At an ocean-ocean convergent boundary, one of the plates (oceanic crust and lithospheric mantle) is pushed, or subducted<strong>,</strong> under the other. Often it is the older and colder plate that is denser and subducts beneath the younger and hotter plate. There is commonly an ocean trench along the boundary. The subducted lithosphere descends into the hot mantle at a relatively shallow angle close to the subduction zone, but at steeper angles farther down (up to about 45°). As discussed in the context of subduction-related volcanism in Chapter 4, the significant volume of water within the subducting material is released as the subducting crust is heated. This water is mostly derived from alteration of pyroxene and olivine to serpentine near the spreading ridge shortly after the rock’s formation. It mixes with the overlying mantle, and the addition of water to the hot mantle lowers the crust’s melting point and leads to the formation of magma (flux melting). The magma, which is lighter than the surrounding mantle material, rises through the mantle and the overlying oceanic crust to the ocean floor where it creates a chain of volcanic islands known as an island arc. A mature island arc develops into a chain of relatively large islands (such as Japan or Indonesia) as more and more volcanic material is extruded and sedimentary rocks accumulate around the islands.</p> <p>As described above in the context of Benioff zones (Figure 10.10), earthquakes take place close to the boundary between the subducting crust and the overriding crust. The largest earthquakes occur near the surface where the subducting plate is still cold and strong.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_564" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-564" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0551.png"><img class="wp-image-564" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0551.png" height="185" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-564">Figure 10.21 Configuration and processes of an ocean-ocean convergent boundary [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Examples of ocean-ocean convergent zones are subduction of the Pacific Plate south of Alaska (Aleutian Islands) and west of the Philippines, subduction of the India Plate south of Indonesia, and subduction of the Atlantic Plate beneath the Caribbean Plate (Figure 10.21).</p> <p>At an ocean-continent convergent boundary, the oceanic plate is pushed under the continental plate in the same manner as at an ocean-ocean boundary. Sediment that has accumulated on the <strong>continental slope</strong> is thrust up into an accretionary wedge, and compression leads to thrusting within the continental plate (Figure 10.22). The mafic magma produced adjacent to the subduction zone rises to the base of the continental crust and leads to partial melting of the crustal rock. The resulting magma ascends through the crust, producing a mountain chain with many volcanoes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_565" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-565" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0572.png"><img class="wp-image-565" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0572.png" height="190" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-565">Figure 10.22 Configuration and processes of an ocean-continent convergent boundary [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Examples of ocean-continent convergent boundaries are subduction of the Nazca Plate under South America (which has created the Andes Range) and subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate under North America (creating the mountains Garibaldi, Baker, St. Helens, Rainier, Hood, and Shasta, collectively known as the Cascade Range).</p> <p>A continent-continent collision occurs when a continent or large island that has been moved along with subducting oceanic crust collides with another continent (Figure 10.23). The colliding continental material will not be subducted because it is too light (i.e., because it is composed largely of light continental rocks [SIAL]), but the root of the oceanic plate will eventually break off and sink into the mantle. There is tremendous deformation of the pre-existing continental rocks, and creation of mountains from that rock, from any sediments that had accumulated along the shores (i.e., within geosynclines) of both continental masses, and commonly also from some ocean crust and upper mantle material.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-566" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image0591.png"><img class="wp-image-566" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image0591.png" height="168" width="400" alt="image" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-566">Figure 10.23 Configuration and processes of a continent-continent convergent boundary [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Examples of continent-continent convergent boundaries are the collision of the India Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the Himalaya Mountains, and the collision of the African Plate with the Eurasian Plate, creating the series of ranges extending from the Alps in Europe to the Zagros Mountains in Iran. The Rocky Mountains in B.C. and Alberta are also a result of continent-continent collisions.</p> <p>Transform boundaries exist where one plate slides past another without production or destruction of crustal material. As explained above, most transform faults connect segments of mid-ocean ridges and are thus ocean-ocean plate boundaries (Figure 10.15). Some transform faults connect continental parts of plates. An example is the San Andreas Fault, which connects the southern end of the Juan de Fuca Ridge with the northern end of the East Pacific Rise (ridge) in the Gulf of California (Figures 10.24 an 10.25). The part of California west of the San Andreas Fault and all of Baja California are on the Pacific Plate. Transform faults do not just connect divergent boundaries.

Explain why the Nootka Fault is a transform fault, and show the <em>relative</em> sense of motion along the fault with two small arrows.</p> </div> </div> <p>As originally described by Wegener in 1915, the present continents were once all part of a supercontinent, which he termed <strong>Pangea</strong> (<em>all land</em>). More recent studies of continental matchups and the magnetic ages of ocean-floor rocks have enabled us to reconstruct the history of the break-up of Pangea.</p> <p>Pangea began to rift apart along a line between Africa and Asia and between North America and South America at around 200 Ma. During the same period, the Atlantic Ocean began to open up between northern Africa and North America, and India broke away from Antarctica. Between 200 and 150 Ma, rifting started between South America and Africa and between North America and Europe, and India moved north toward Asia. By 80 Ma, Africa had separated from South America, most of Europe had separated from North America, and India had separated from Antarctica. By 50 Ma, Australia had separated from Antarctic, and shortly after that, India collided with Asia. To see the timing of these processes for yourself go to: <a href="http://barabus.tru.ca/geol1031/plates.html">http://barabus.tru.ca/geol1031/plates.html</a>.</p> <p>Within the past few million years, rifting has taken place in the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, and also within the Gulf of California. Incipient rifting has begun along the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa, extending from Ethiopia and Djibouti on the Gulf of Aden (Red Sea) all the way south to Malawi.</p> <p>Over the next 50 million years, it is likely that there will be full development of the east African rift and creation of new ocean floor. Eventually Africa will split apart. There will also be continued northerly movement of Australia and Indonesia. The western part of California (including Los Angeles and part of San Francisco) will split away from the rest of North America, and eventually sail right by the west coast of Vancouver Island, en route to Alaska. Because the oceanic crust formed by spreading on the mid-Atlantic ridge is not currently being subducted (except in the Caribbean), the Atlantic Ocean is slowly getting bigger, and the Pacific Ocean is getting smaller. If this continues without changing for another couple hundred million years, we will be back to where we started, with one supercontinent.</p> <p>Pangea, which existed from about 350 to 200 Ma, was not the first supercontinent. It was preceded by Pannotia (600 to 540 Ma), by Rodinia (1,100 to 750 Ma), and by others before that.</p> <p>In 1966, Tuzo Wilson proposed that there has been a continuous series of cycles of continental rifting and collision; that is, break-up of supercontinents, drifting, collision, and formation of other supercontinents. At present, North and South America, Europe, and Africa are moving with their respective portions of the Atlantic Ocean. The eastern margins of North and South America and the western margins of Europe and Africa are called <strong>passive margins</strong> because there is no subduction taking place along them.</p> <p>This situation may not continue for too much longer, however. As the Atlantic Ocean floor gets weighed down around its margins by great thickness of continental sediments (i.e., geosynclines), it will be pushed farther and farther into the mantle, and eventually the oceanic lithosphere may break away from the continental lithosphere (Figure 10.26). A subduction zone will develop, and the oceanic plate will begin to descend under the continent. Once this happens, the continents will no longer continue to move apart because the spreading at the mid-Atlantic ridge will be taken up by subduction. If spreading along the mid-Atlantic ridge continues to be slower than spreading within the Pacific Ocean, the Atlantic Ocean will start to close up, and eventually (in a 100 million years or more) North and South America will collide with Europe and Africa.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_570" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-570" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/image067.png"><img class="wp-image-570" alt="image067" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/image067.png" height="352" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-570">Figure 10.26 Development of a subduction zone at a passive margin. Times A, B, and C are separated by tens of millions of years. Once the oceanic crust breaks off and starts to subduct the continental crust (North America in this case) will no longer be pushed to the west and will likely start to move east because the rate of spreading in the Pacific basin is faster than that in the Atlantic basin. [SE]</div></div> <p>There is strong evidence around the margins of the Atlantic Ocean that this process has taken place before. The roots of ancient mountain belts, which are present along the eastern margin of North America, the western margin of Europe, and the northwestern margin of Africa, show that these land masses once collided with each other to form a mountain chain, possibly as big as the Himalayas. The apparent line of collision runs between Norway and Sweden, between Scotland and England, through Ireland, through Newfoundland, and the Maritimes, through the northeastern and eastern states, and across the northern end of Florida. When rifting of Pangea started at approximately 200 Ma, the fissuring was along a different line from the line of the earlier collision. This is why some of the mountain chains formed during the earlier collision can be traced from Europe to North America and from Europe to Africa.</p> <p>That the Atlantic Ocean rift may have occurred in approximately the same place during two separate events several hundred million years apart is probably no coincidence. The series of hot spots that has been identified in the Atlantic Ocean may also have existed for several hundred million years, and thus may have contributed to rifting in roughly the same place on at least two separate occasions (Figure 10.27).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-536" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Wilson-cycle.png"><img class="wp-image-536" alt="Wilson cycle" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Wilson-cycle.png" height="314" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-536">Figure 10.27 A scenario for the Wilson cycle.

When the rock can no longer withstand the deformation, it breaks and the two sides slide past each other. Most earthquakes take place near plate boundaries, but not necessarily right on a boundary, and not necessarily even on a pre-existing fault.</p> <p>The engineering principle of <strong>elastic deformation</strong>, which can be used to understand earthquakes, is illustrated in Figure 11.2. The stress applied to a rock — typically because of ongoing plate movement — results in strain or deformation of the rock (Figure 11.2b). Because most rock is strong (unlike loose sand, for example), it can withstand a significant amount of deformation without breaking. But every rock has a deformation limit and will rupture (break) once that limit is reached. At that point, in the case of rocks within the crust, the rock breaks and there is displacement along the <strong>rupture surface</strong> (Figure 11.2c). The magnitude of the earthquake depends on the extent of the area that breaks (the area of the rupture surface) and the average amount of displacement (sliding).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_605" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-605" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/elastic-deformation-and-rupture.png"><img class="wp-image-605" alt="elastic deformation and rupture" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/elastic-deformation-and-rupture.png" height="208" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-605">Figure 11.2 Depiction of the concept of elastic deformation and rupture, looking down. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The concept of a rupture surface, which is critical to understanding earthquakes, is illustrated in Figure 11.3. An earthquake does not happen at a point, it happens over an area within a plane, although not necessarily a <em>flat </em>plane. Within the area of the rupture surface, the amount of displacement is variable (Figure 11.3), and, by definition, it decreases to zero at the edges of the rupture surface because the rock beyond that point isn’t displaced at all. The extent of a rupture surface and the amount of displacement will depend on a number of factors, including the type and strength of the rock, and the degree to which it was stressed beforehand.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_606" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-606" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/rupture-surface.png"><img class="wp-image-606" alt="rupture surface" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/rupture-surface.png" height="186" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-606">Figure 11.3 A rupture surface (dark pink), on a steeply dipping fault plane (light pink).

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Earthquake rupture doesn’t happen all at once; it starts at a single point and spreads rapidly from there. Depending on the extent of the rupture surface, the propagation of failures out from the point of initiation is typically completed within seconds to several tens of seconds (Figure 11.4). The initiation point isn’t necessarily in the centre of the rupture surface; it may be close to one end, near the top, or near the bottom.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_607" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-607" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Propagation-of-failure.png"><img class="wp-image-607" alt="Propagation of failure" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Propagation-of-failure.png" height="191" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-607">Figure 11.4 Propagation of failure on a rupture surface.

Panel (b) is a section along the San Andreas Fault; this view is equivalent to what is shown in Figures 11.3 and 11.4. The area of red dots is the rupture surface; each red dot is a specific aftershock that was recorded on a seismometer. The hexagon labelled “main earthquake” represents the first or main shock. When that happened, the rock at that location broke and was displaced. That released the stress on that particular part of the fault, but it resulted in an increase of the stress on other nearby parts of the fault, and contributed to a cascade of smaller ruptures (aftershocks), in this case, over an area about 60 km long and 15 km wide.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_608" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-608" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/aftershocks.jpg"><img class="wp-image-608" alt="aftershocks" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/aftershocks.jpg" height="324" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-608">Figure 11.5 Distribution of the aftershocks of the 1989 M 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake (a: plan view, b: section along the fault, c: section across the fault.) [from Open University under CC Sharealike, http://www.open.edu/openlearnworks/mod/page/view.php?id=45426]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>So, what exactly is an aftershock then? An aftershock is an earthquake just like any other, but it is one that can be shown to have been triggered by <strong>stress transfer</strong> from a preceding earthquake. Within a few tens of seconds of the main Loma Prieta earthquake, there were hundreds of smaller aftershocks; their distribution defines the area of the rupture surface.</p> <p>Aftershocks can be of any magnitude. Most are smaller than the earthquake that triggered them, but they can be bigger. The aftershocks shown in Figure 11.5 all happened within seconds or minutes of the main shock, but aftershocks can be delayed for hours, days, weeks, or even years. As already noted, aftershocks are related to stress transfer. For example, the main shock of the Loma Prieta earthquake triggered aftershocks in the immediate area, which triggered more in the surrounding area, eventually extending for 30 km along the fault in each direction and for 15 km toward the surface. But the earthquake as a whole also changed the stress on adjacent parts of the San Andreas Fault. This effect, which has been modelled for numerous earthquakes and active faults around the world, is depicted in Figure 11.6. Stress was reduced in the area of the rupture (blue), but was increased at either end of the rupture surface (red and yellow).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_609" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-609" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/stress-changes.png"><img class="wp-image-609" alt="stress changes" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/stress-changes-e1439324273866.png" height="192" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-609">Figure 11.6 Depiction of stress changes related to an earthquake. Stress decreases in the area of the rupture surface, but increases on adjacent parts of the fault. [by SE based on data from 2010 Laguna Salada earthquake by Stein and Toda at: http://supersites.earthobservations.org/Baja_stress.png]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Stress transfer isn’t necessarily restricted to the fault along which an earthquake happened. It will affect the rocks in general around the site of the earthquake and may lead to increased stress on other faults in the region. The effects of stress transfer don’t necessarily show up right away. Segments of faults are typically in some state of stress, and the transfer of stress from another area is only rarely enough to push a fault segment beyond its limits to the point of rupture. The stress that is added by stress transfer accumulates along with the ongoing buildup of stress from plate motion and eventually leads to another earthquake.</p> <h1>Episodic tremor and slip</h1> <p>Episodic tremor and slip (ETS) is periodic slow sliding along part of a subduction boundary. It does not produce recognizable earthquakes, but does produce seismic tremor (rapid seismic vibrations on a seismometer). It was first discovered on the Vancouver Island part of the Cascadia subduction zone by Geological Survey of Canada geologists Herb Dragert and Gary Rogers.*</p> <p>The boundary between the subducting Juan de Fuca Plate and the North America Plate can be divided into three segments, as shown below. The cold upper part of the boundary is locked. The plates are stuck and don’t move, except with very large earthquakes that happen <em>approximately</em> every 500 years (the last one was M8.5+ in January 26, 1700). The warm lower part of the boundary is sliding continuously because the warm rock is weaker. The central part of the boundary isn’t cold enough to be stuck, but isn’t warm enough to slide continuously. Instead it slips episodically, approximately every 14 months for about 2 weeks, moving a few centimetres each time.</p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-610"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Episodic-tremor.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-610" alt="Episodic tremor" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Episodic-tremor.png" height="275" width="600" /></a></div> <p>You might be inclined to think that it’s a good thing that there is periodic slip on this part of the plate because it releases some of the tension and reduces the risk of a large earthquake. In fact, the opposite is likely the case. The movement along the ETS part of the plate boundary acts like a medium-sized earthquake and leads to stress transfer to the adjacent locked part of the plate. Approximately every 14 months, during the two-week ETS period, there is a transfer of stress to the shallow locked part of the Cascadia subduction zone, and therefore an increased chance of a large earthquake.</p> <p>Since 2003, ETS processes have also been observed on subduction zones in Mexico and Japan.

It is relatively easy to see the relationships between earthquakes and the plate boundaries. Along divergent boundaries like the mid-Atlantic ridge and the East Pacific Rise, earthquakes are common, but restricted to a narrow zone close to the ridge, and consistently at less than 30 km depth. Shallow earthquakes are also common along transform faults, such as the San Andreas Fault.

Here, as we saw in Chapter 10, the segments of the mid-Atlantic ridge are offset by some long transform faults. Most of the earthquakes are located along the transform faults, rather than along the spreading segments, although there are clusters of earthquakes at some of the ridge-transform boundaries. Some earthquakes do occur on spreading ridges, but they tend to be small and infrequent because of the relatively high rock temperatures in the areas where spreading is taking place.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_981" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-981" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/transform-quakes-2.png"><img width="300" height="152" class="size-medium wp-image-981" alt="Figure 11.8 Distribution of earthquakes of M4 and greater in the area of the mid-Atlantic ridge near the equator from 1990 to 1996.

In both cases, the earthquakes get deeper with distance from the trench.

Many of the earthquakes are related to the transform faults on either side of the India Plate, and most of the others are related to the significant tectonic squeezing caused by the continued convergence of the India and Asia Plates. That squeezing has caused the Asia Plate to be thrust over top of the India Plate, building the Himalayas and the Tibet Plateau to enormous heights. Most of the earthquakes of Figure 11.11 are related to the thrust faults shown in Figure 11.12 (and to hundreds of other similar ones that cannot be shown at this scale).

The first of these is an estimate of the energy released, and the value is referred to as <strong>magnitude</strong>. This is the number that is typically used by the press when a big earthquake happens. It is often referred to as “Richter magnitude,” but that is a misnomer, and it should be just “magnitude.” There are many ways to measure magnitude — including Charles Richter’s method developed in 1935 — but they are all ways to estimate the same number: the amount of energy released.</p> <p>The other way of assessing the impact of an earthquake is to assess what people felt and how much damage was done. This is known as <strong>intensity. </strong>Intensity values are assigned to locations, rather than to the earthquake itself, and therefore intensity can vary widely, depending on the proximity to the earthquake and the types of materials and conditions of the subsurface.</p> <h1><strong>Earthquake Magnitude</strong></h1> <p>Before we look more closely at magnitude we need to review what we know about body waves, and look at surface waves. Body waves are of two types, P-waves, or primary or compression waves (like the compression of the coils of a spring), and S-waves, or secondary or shear waves (like the flick of a rope). An example of P and S seismic wave records is shown in Figure 11.13. The critical parameters for the measurement of Richter magnitude are labelled, including the time interval between the arrival of the P- and S-waves — which is used to determine the distance from the earthquake to the seismic station, and the amplitude of the S waves — which is used to estimate the magnitude of the earthquake.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-618" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/P-and-S-waves.png"><img class="wp-image-618" alt="P and S waves" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/P-and-S-waves.png" height="158" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-618">Figure 11.13 P-waves and S-waves from a small (M4) earthquake that took place near Vancouver Island in 1997. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>When body waves (P or S) reach Earth’s surface, some of their energy is transformed into surface waves, of which there are two main types, as illustrated in Figure 11.14. <strong>Rayleigh waves</strong> are characterized by vertical motion of the ground surface, like waves on water, while <strong>Love waves</strong> are characterized by horizontal motion. Both Rayleigh and Love waves are about 10% slower than S-waves (so they arrive later at a seismic station). Surface waves typically have greater amplitudes than body waves, and they do more damage.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_619" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-619" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/seismic-surface.png"><img class="wp-image-619" alt="seismic surface" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/seismic-surface.png" height="103" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-619">Figure 11.14 Depiction of seismic surface waves [SE after: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rayleigh_wave#/media/File:Rayleigh_wave.jpg and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Love_wave#/media/File:Love_wave.jpg]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Other important terms for describing earthquakes are <strong>hypocentre</strong> (or <strong>focus</strong>) and <strong>epicentre</strong>. The hypocentre is the actual location of an individual earthquake shock at depth in the ground, and the epicentre is the point on the land surface directly above the hypocentre (Figure 11.15).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_620" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-620" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/hypocentre.png"><img class="wp-image-620" alt="hypocentre" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/hypocentre.png" height="191" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-620">Figure 11.15 Epicentre and hypocentre [SE]</div></div> <p>A number of methods for estimating magnitude are listed in Table 11.1. Local magnitude (ML) was widely used until late in the 20th century, but <strong>moment magnitude</strong> (MW) is now more commonly used because it gives more accurate estimates (especially with larger earthquakes) and can be applied to earthquakes at any distance from a seismometer. Surface-wave magnitudes can also be applied to measure distant large earthquakes.</p> <p>Because of the increasing size of cities in earthquake-prone areas (e.g., China, Japan, California) and the increasing sophistication of infrastructure, it is becoming important to have very rapid warnings and magnitude estimates of earthquakes that have already happened. This can be achieved by using P-wave data to determine magnitude because P-waves arrive first at seismic stations, in many cases several seconds ahead of the more damaging S-waves and surface waves. Operators of electrical grids, pipelines, trains, and other infrastructure can use the information to automatically shut down systems so that damage and casualties can be limited.</p> <table><caption>Table 11.1 A summary of some of the different methods for estimating earthquake magnitude.

If buildings are present, the size and type of buildings (and their inherent natural vibrations) are also important.</p> <p>Intensity scales were first used in the late 19th century, and then adapted in the early 20th century by Giuseppe Mercalli and modified later by others to form what we know call the modified Mercalli intensity scale (Table 11.2). Intensity estimates are important because they allow us to characterize parts of any region into areas that are especially prone to strong shaking versus those that are not. The key factor in this regard is the nature of the underlying geological materials, and the weaker those are, the more likely it is that there will be strong shaking. Areas underlain by strong solid bedrock tend to experience much less shaking than those underlain by unconsolidated river or lake sediments.</p> <table><caption>Table 11.2 The modified Mercalli intensity scale.

There was relatively little damage in the area around the epicentre, but there was tremendous damage and about 5,000 deaths in heavily populated Mexico City some 350 km from the epicentre. The key reason for this is that Mexico City was built largely on the unconsolidated and water-saturated sediment of former Lake Texcoco. These sediments resonate at a frequency of about two seconds, which was similar to the frequency of the body waves that reached the city. For the same reason that a powerful opera singer can break a wine glass by singing the right note, the amplitude of the seismic waves was amplified by the lake sediments. Survivors of the disaster recounted that the ground in some areas moved up and down by about 20 cm every two seconds for over two minutes. Damage was greatest to buildings between 5 and 15 storeys tall, because they also resonated at around two seconds, which amplified the shaking.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 11.3 Estimating Intensity from Personal Observations</strong></p> <p>The following observations were made by residents of the Nanaimo area during the M6.8 Nisqually earthquake near Olympia, Washington, in 2001.

The types of impacts depend to a large degree on where the earthquake is located: whether it is predominantly urban or rural, densely or sparsely populated, highly developed or underdeveloped, and of course on the ability of the infrastructure to withstand shaking.</p> <p>As we’ve seen from the example of the 1985 Mexico earthquake, the geological foundations on which structures are built can have a significant impact on earthquake shaking. When an earthquake happens, the seismic waves produced have a wide range of frequencies. The energy of the higher frequency waves tends to be absorbed by solid rock, while the lower frequency waves (with periods slower than one second) pass through the solid rock without being absorbed, but are eventually absorbed and amplified by soft sediments. It is therefore very common to see much worse earthquake damage in areas underlain by soft sediments than in areas of solid rock. A good example of this is in the Oakland area near San Francisco, where parts of a two-layer highway built on soft sediments collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake (Figure 11.17).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-622" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Cypress-Freeway.jpg"><img class="wp-image-622" alt="Cypress Freeway" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Cypress-Freeway.jpg" height="267" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-622">Figure 11.17 A part of the Cypress Freeway in Oakland California that collapsed during the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.

Buildings can be designed to withstand most earthquakes, and this practice is increasingly applied in earthquake-prone regions. Turkey is one such region, and even though Turkey had a relatively strong building code in the 1990s, adherence to the code was poor, as builders did whatever they could to save costs, including using inappropriate materials in concrete and reducing the amount of steel reinforcing. The result was that there were over 17,000 deaths in the 1999 M7.6 Izmit earthquake (Figure 11.18). After two devastating earthquakes that year, Turkish authorities strengthened the building code further, but the new code has been applied only in a few regions, and enforcement of the code is still weak, as revealed by the amount of damage from a M7.1 earthquake in eastern Turkey in 2011.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_603" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-603" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/earthquake-in-the-Izmit.png"><img class="wp-image-603" alt="earthquake in the Izmit" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/earthquake-in-the-Izmit.png" height="150" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-603">Figure 11.18 Buildings damaged by the 1999 earthquake in the Izmit area, Turkey.

Most of the damage in the great 1906 San Francisco earthquake was caused by massive fires in the downtown area of the city (Figure 11.20). Some 25,000 buildings were destroyed by those fires, which were fuelled by broken gas pipes. Fighting the fires was difficult because water mains had also ruptured. The risk of fires can be reduced through P-wave early warning systems if utility operators can reduce pipeline pressure and close electrical circuits.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_623" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-623" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Tohoku-earthquake.jpg"><img class="wp-image-623" alt="Tohoku earthquake" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Tohoku-earthquake.jpg" height="222" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-623">Figure 11.19 Some of the effects of the 2011 Tohoku earthquake in the Sendai area of Japan.

When water-saturated sediments are shaken, the grains become rearranged to the point where they are no longer supporting one another. Instead, the water between the grains is holding them apart and the material can flow. Liquefaction can lead to the collapse of buildings and other structures that might be otherwise undamaged. A good example is the collapse of apartment buildings during the 1964 Niigata earthquake (M7.6) in Japan (Figure 11.22). Liquefaction can also contribute to slope failures and to fountains of sandy mud (sand volcanoes) in areas where there is loose saturated sand beneath a layer of more cohesive clay.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-626" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Niigata.jpg"><img class="wp-image-626 size-full" alt="Niigata" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Niigata.jpg" height="297" width="500" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-626">Figure 11.22 Collapsed apartment buildings in the Niigata area of Japan.

Under these conditions, it can be expected that seismic shaking will be amplified and, the sandy sediments will liquefy. This could lead to subsidence and tilting of buildings, and to failure and sliding of the silt and clay layer.

The simplest is to go to a sandy beach (lake, ocean, or river) and find a place near the water’s edge where the sand is wet. This is best done with your shoes off, so let’s hope it’s not too cold! While standing in one place on a wet part of the beach, start moving your feet up and down at a frequency of about once per second. Within a few seconds the previously firm sand will start to lose strength, and you’ll gradually sink in up to your ankles.</p> <p>If you can’t get to a beach, or if the weather isn’t cooperating, put some sand (sandbox sand will do) into a small container, saturate it with water, and then pour the excess water off. You can shake it gently to get the water to separate and then pour the excess water away, and you may have to do that more than once. Place a small rock on the surface of the sand; it should sit there for hours without sinking in. Now, holding the container in one hand gently thump the side or the bottom with your other hand, about twice a second. The rock should gradually sink in as the sand around it becomes liquefied.</p> <div class="wp-nocaption aligncenter wp-image-628"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Liquefaction.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-628" alt="Liquefaction" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Liquefaction.png" height="182" width="400" /></a></div> <p>As you were moving your feet up and down or thumping the pot, it’s likely that you soon discovered the most effective rate for getting the sand to liquefy; this would have been close to the natural harmonic frequency for that body of material. Stepping up and down as fast as you can (several times per second) on the wet beach would not have been effective, nor would you have achieved much by stepping once every several seconds. The body of sand vibrates most readily in response to shaking that is close to its natural harmonic frequency, and liquefaction is also most likely to occur at that frequency.</p> </div> </div> <p>Earthquakes that take place beneath the ocean have the potential to generate <strong>tsunami.[</strong>footnote]Tsunami is the Japanese word for harbour wave. It is the same in both singular and plural.[/footnote] The most likely situation for a significant tsunami is a large (M7 or greater) subduction-related earthquake. As shown in Figure 11.24, during the time between earthquakes the overriding plate becomes distorted by elastic deformation; it is squeezed laterally (Figure 11.24B) and pushed up.</p> <p>When an earthquake happens (Figure 11.24C), the plate rebounds and there is both uplift and subsidence on the sea floor, in some cases by as much as several metres vertically over an area of thousands of square kilometres. This vertical motion is transmitted through the water column where it generates a wave that then spreads across the ocean.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-602" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Elastic-deformation.png"><img class="wp-image-602" alt="Elastic deformation" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Elastic-deformation.png" height="509" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-602">Figure 11.24 Elastic deformation and rebound of overriding plate at a subduction setting (B).

Sea-floor transform earthquakes, even large ones (M7 to M8), don’t typically generate tsunami either, because the motion is mostly side to side, not vertical.</p> <p>Tsunami waves travel at velocities of several hundred kilometres per hour and easily make it to the far side of an ocean in about the same time as a passenger jet.

Many different avenues of prediction have been explored, such as using observations of warning foreshocks, changes in magnetic fields, seismic tremor, changing groundwater levels, strange animal behaviour, observed periodicity, stress transfer considerations, and others. So far, none of the research into earthquake prediction has provided a reliable method. Although there are some reports of successful earthquake predictions, they are rare, and many are surrounded by doubtful circumstances.</p> <p>The problem with earthquake predictions, as with any other type of prediction, is that they have to be accurate <em>most </em>of the time, not just <em>some</em> of the time. We have come to rely on weather predictions because they are generally (and increasingly) accurate. But if we try to predict earthquakes and are only accurate 10% of the time (and even that isn’t possible with the current state of knowledge), the public will lose faith in the process very quickly, and then will ignore all of the predictions. Efforts are currently focused on forecasting earthquake probabilities, rather than predicting their occurrence.</p> <p>There was great hope for earthquake predictions late in the 1980s when attention was focused on part of the San Andreas Fault at Parkfield, about 200 km south of San Francisco. Between 1881 and 1965 there were five earthquakes at Parkfield, most spaced at approximately 20-year intervals, all confined to the same 20 km-long segment of the fault, and all very close to M6 (Figure 11.26). Both the 1934 and 1966 earthquakes were preceded by small foreshocks exactly 17 minutes before the main quake.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_630" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-630" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Parkfield-segment.png"><img width="400" height="169" class="wp-image-630" alt="Parkfield segment" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Parkfield-segment.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-630">Figure 11.26 Earthquakes on the Parkfield segment of the San Andreas Fault between 1881 and 2004. [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The U.S. Geological Survey recognized this as an excellent opportunity to understand earthquakes and earthquake prediction, so they armed the Parkfield area with a huge array of geophysical instruments and waited for the next quake, which was expected to happen around 1987. Nothing happened! The “1987 Parkfield earthquake” finally struck in September 2004. Fortunately all of the equipment was still there, but it was no help from the perspective of earthquake prediction. There were no significant precursors to the 2004 Parkfield earthquake in any of the parameters measured, including seismicity, harmonic tremor, strain (rock deformation), magnetic field, the conductivity of the rock, or creep, and there was no foreshock. In other words, even though every available technique was used to monitor it, the 2004 earthquake came as a complete surprise, with no warning whatsoever.</p> <p>The hope for earthquake prediction is not dead, but it was hit hard by the Parkfield experiment. The current focus in earthquake-prone regions is to provide forecasts of the probability of an earthquake of a certain magnitude within a certain time period — typically a number of decades — while officials focus on ensuring that the population is educated about earthquake risks and that buildings and other infrastructure are as safe as can be. An example of this approach for the San Francisco Bay region of California is shown in Figure 11.27. Based on a wide range of information, including past earthquake history, accumulated stress from plate movement, and known stress transfer, seismologists and geologists have predicted the likelihood of a M6.7 or greater earthquake on each of eight major faults that cut through the region. The greatest probabilities are on the San Andreas, Rogers Creek, and Hayward Faults. As shown in Figure 11.27, there is a 63% chance that a major and damaging earthquake will take place somewhere in the region prior to 2036.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_631" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-631" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/M6.7-or-larger-earthquake.png"><img width="400" height="539" class="wp-image-631" alt="M6.7 or larger earthquake" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/M6.7-or-larger-earthquake-e1439325159863.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-631">Figure 11.27 Probabilities of a M6.7 or larger earthquake over the period 2007 to 2036 on various faults in the San Francisco Bay region of California.

Building code compliance is quite robust in most developed countries, but is sadly inadequate in many developing countries.</p> <p>It’s also not enough just to focus on new buildings; we have to make sure that existing buildings — especially schools and hospitals — and other structures such as bridges and dams, are as safe as they can be. An example of how this is applied to schools in B.C. is described in Box 11.2.</p> <h3>Making the seismic upgrade in B.C.’s schools</h3> <p>British Columbia is in the middle of a multi-billion-dollar program to make schools safer for students. The program is focused on older schools, because, according to the government, those built since 1992 already comply with modern seismic codes. Some schools would require too much work to make upgrading economically feasible and they are replaced. Where upgrading is feasible, the school is assessed carefully before any upgrade work is initiated.</p> <p>An example is Sangster Elementary in Colwood on southern Vancouver Island. The school was originally built in 1957, with a major addition in 1973. Ironically, the newer part of the school, built of concrete blocks, required strengthening with the addition of a steel framework, while the 1957 part, which is a wood-frame building, did not require seismic upgrading. The work was completed in 2014.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_632" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-632" style="width: 941px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/seismic-upgrade.png"><img width="941" height="269" class="wp-image-632 size-full" alt="seismic upgrade" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/seismic-upgrade.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-632">[Sangster Elementary image from Google Maps – street view]</div></div> <p>As of January 2015, upgrades had been completed at 145 B.C. schools, 11 were underway, and an additional 57 were ready to proceed with funding identified.* Another 129 schools were listed as needing upgrades.

The rupture is initiated at a point but quickly spreads across an area of a fault, via a series of aftershocks initiated by stress transfer. Episodic tremor and slip is a periodic slow movement, accompanied by harmonic tremors, along the middle part of a subduction zone boundary.</td> </tr> <tr><th>11.2</th> <th>Earthquakes and Plate Tectonics</th> <td>Most earthquakes take place at or near plate boundaries, especially at transform boundaries (where most quakes are at less than 30 km depth) and at convergent boundaries (where they can be at well over 100 km depth). The largest earthquakes happen at subduction zones, typically in the upper section where the rock is relatively cool.</td> </tr> <tr><th>11.3</th> <th>Measuring Earthquakes</th> <td>Magnitude is a measure of the amount of energy released by an earthquake, and it is proportional to the area of the rupture surface and to the amount of displacement. Although any earthquake has only one magnitude value, it can be estimated in various ways, mostly involving seismic data. Intensity is a measure of the amount of shaking experienced and damage done at a particular location around the earthquake. Intensity will vary depending on the distance to the epicentre, the depth of the earthquake, and the geological nature of the material below surface.</td> </tr> <tr><th>11.4</th> <th>The Impacts of Earthquakes</th> <td>Damage to buildings is the most serious consequence of most large earthquakes. The amount of damage is related to the type and size of buildings, how they are constructed, and the nature of the material on which they are built. Other important consequences are fires, damage to bridges and highways, slope failures, liquefaction, and tsunami. Tsunami, which are almost all related to large subduction earthquakes, can be devastating.</td> </tr> <tr><th>11.5</th> <th>Forecasting Earthquakes and Minimizing Damage and Casualties</th> <td>There is no reliable technology for predicting earthquakes, but the probability of one happening within a certain time period can be forecast. We can minimize earthquake impacts by ensuring that citizens are aware of the risk, that building codes are enforced, that existing buildings like schools and hospitals are seismically sound, and that both public and personal emergency plans are in place.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

Rocks have highly varying strain responses to stress because of their different compositions and physical properties, and because temperature is a big factor and rock temperatures within the crust can vary greatly.</p> <p>We can describe the stress applied to a rock by breaking it down into three dimensions—all at right angles to one-another (Figure 12.2). If the rock is subject only to the pressure of burial, the stresses in all three directions will likely be the same.  If it is subject to both burial and tectonic forces, the pressures will be different in different directions.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1014" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1014" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/stress-applied-to-rocks-within-the-crust.png"><img width="400" height="201" class="wp-image-1014" alt="Figure 12.2 Depiction of the stress applied to rocks within the crust.  The stress can be broken down into 3 components.  Assuming that we’re looking down in this case, the green arrows represent north-south stress, the red arrows east-west stress, and the blue arrows (the one underneath is not visible) represent up-down stress.

Higher temperatures lead to more plastic behaviour. Some rocks or sediments are also more plastic when they are wet.  Another factor is the rate at which the stress is applied.  If the stress is applied quickly (for example, because of an extraterrestrial impact or an earthquake), there will be an increased tendency for the rock to fracture. Some different types of strain response are illustrated in Figure 12.3.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1015" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/response-of-geological-materials-to-stress.png"><img width="400" height="286" class="wp-image-1015" alt="Figure 12.3 The varying types of response of geological materials to stress.  The straight dashed parts are elastic strain and the curved parts are plastic strain.  In each case the X marks where the material fractured.  A, the strongest material deforms relatively little and breaks at a high stress level.  B, strong but brittle, shows no plastic deformation and breaks after relatively little elastic deformation.  C, the most deformable, only breaks after significant elastic and plastic strain.  The three deformation diagrams on the right show A and C before breaking and B after breaking.

Most of the rock in Figure 12.4c is limestone, which is relatively easily deformed when heated. The dark rock is chert, which remains brittle. As the limestone stretched (parallel to the hammer handle) the brittle chert was forced to break into fragments to accommodate the change in shape of the body of rock. A fault is a rock boundary along which the rocks on either side have been displaced relative to each other (Figure 12.4d).</p> </div></div>

expanding because of reduced pressure, as shown by the two examples in Figure 12.9, or where the rock itself is contracting but the body of rock remains the same size (the cooling volcanic rock in Figure 12.4a). In all of these cases, the pressure regime is one of <em>tension</em> as opposed to <em>compression</em>. Joints can also develop where rock is being folded because, while folding typically happens during compression, there may be some parts of the fold that are in tension (Figure 12.10).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1023"

motion (Figure 12.4d). As we discussed in Chapter 11, an earthquake involves the sliding of one body of rock past another. Earthquakes don’t necessarily happen on existing faults, but once an earthquake takes place a fault will exist in the rock at that location. Some large faults, like the San Andreas Fault in California or the Tintina Fault, which extends from northern B.C. through central Yukon and into Alaska, show evidence of hundreds of kilometres of motion, while others show less than a millimetre. In order to estimate the amount of motion on a fault, we need to find some geological feature that shows up on both sides and has been offset (Figure 12.12).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1025" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1025" style="width:

side of the fault has moved to the right, this is a <em>right-lateral fault</em>. If the photo were taken from the other side, the fault would still appear to have a right-lateral offset.   [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are several kinds of faults, as illustrated on Figure 12.13, and they develop under different stress conditions. The terms <em>hanging wall</em> and <em>footwall</em> in the diagrams apply to situations where the fault is not vertical. The body of rock above the fault is called the <strong>hanging wall</strong>, and the body of rock below it is called the <strong>footwall</strong>. If the fault develops in a situation of compression, then it will be a <strong>reverse fault</strong> because the compression causes the hanging wall to be pushed up relative to the footwall. If the fault develops in a situation of extension, then it will be a <strong>normal fault</strong>, because the extension allows the hanging wall to slide down relative to the footwall in response to gravity.</p> <p>The third situation is where the bodies of rock are sliding sideways with respect to each other, as is the case along a transform fault (see Chapter 10). This is known as a <strong>strike-slip fault</strong> because the displacement is along the “strike” or the length of the fault. On strike-slip faults the motion is typically only horizontal, or with a very small vertical component, and as discussed above the sense of motion can be right lateral (the far side moves to the right), as in Figures 12.12 and 12.13, or it can be left lateral (the far side moves to the left). Transform faults are strike-slip faults.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1026" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1026" style="width: 400px"><a

areas that are characterized by extensional tectonics, it is not uncommon for a part of the upper crust to subside with respect to neighbouring parts. This is typical along areas of continental rifting, such as the Great Rift Valley of East Africa or in parts of Iceland, but it is also seen elsewhere. In such situations a down-dropped block is known as a <strong>graben</strong> (German for ditch), while an adjacent block that doesn’t subside is called a <strong>horst</strong> (German for heap) (Figure 12.14). There are many horsts and grabens in the Basin and Range area of the western United States, especially in Nevada. Part of the Fraser Valley region of B.C., in the area around Sumas Prairie is a graben.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1027"

plane, is known as a <strong>thrust fault</strong>.

They are responsible for the creation of much of the topography that we see around us. They are also places of great beauty and tranquility, and of course, they provide much of the water that is essential to our existence. But streams are not always peaceful and soothing. During large storms and rapid snowmelts, they can become raging torrents capable of moving cars and houses and destroying roads and bridges. When they spill over their banks, they can flood huge areas, devastating populations and infrastructure. Over the past century, many of the most damaging natural disasters in Canada have been floods, and we can expect them to become even more severe as the climate changes.</p></div>

It is evaporated from the oceans, lakes, streams, the surface of the land, and plants (transpiration) by solar energy (Figure 13.2). It is moved through the atmosphere by winds and condenses to form clouds of water droplets or ice crystals. It comes back down as rain or snow and then flows through streams, into lakes, and eventually back to the oceans. Water on the surface and in streams and lakes infiltrates the ground to become groundwater. Groundwater slowly moves through the rock and surficial materials.

Water is evaporated from the oceans, vegetation, and lakes at a rate of 1,580 km<sup>3</sup> per day, and just about exactly the same volume falls as rain and snow every day — over both the oceans and land. The precipitation that falls on land goes back to the ocean in the form of stream flow (117 km<sup>3</sup>/day) and groundwater flow (6 km<sup>3</sup>/day). Most of the rest of this chapter is about that 117 km<sup>3</sup>/day of streamflow.

[SE]</div></div> <p>Cawston Creek is a typical small drainage basin (approximately 25 km<sup>2</sup>) within a very steep glaciated valley. As shown in Figure 13.5, the upper and middle parts of the creek have steep <strong>gradients</strong> (averaging about 200 m/km but ranging from 100 to 350 m/km), and the lower part, within the valley of the Similkameen River, is relatively flat (&lt;5 m/km). The shape of the valley has been controlled first by tectonic uplift (related to plate convergence), then by pre-glacial stream erosion and mass wasting, then by several episodes of glacial erosion, and finally by post-glacial stream erosion. The lowest elevation of Cawston Creek (275 m at the Similkameen River) is its <strong>base level</strong>. Cawston Creek cannot erode below that level unless the Similkameen River erodes deeper into its flood plain (the area that is inundated during a flood).</p> <p>Metro Vancouver’s water supply comes from three large drainage basins on the north shore of Burrard Inlet, as shown in Figure 13.6. This map illustrates the concept of a drainage basin divide. The boundary between two drainage basins is the height of land between them. A drop of water falling on the boundary between the Capilano and Seymour drainage basins (a.k.a., watersheds), for example, could flow into either one of them.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-799" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/three-drainage-basins.jpg"><img width="400" height="264" class="wp-image-799" alt="Figure 13.6 The three drainage basins that are used for the Metro Vancouver water supply.

[Used with permission of Metro Vancouver]</div></div> <p>The pattern of tributaries within a drainage basin depends largely on the type of rock beneath, and on structures within that rock (folds, fractures, faults, etc.). The three main types of drainage patterns are illustrated in Figure 13.7. <strong>Dendritic </strong>patterns, which are by far the most common, develop in areas where the rock (or unconsolidated material) beneath the stream has no particular fabric or structure and can be eroded equally easily in all directions. Examples would be granite, gneiss, volcanic rock, and sedimentary rock that has not been folded. Most areas of British Columbia have dendritic patterns, as do most areas of the prairies and the Canadian Shield. <strong>Trellis</strong> drainage patterns typically develop where sedimentary rocks have been folded or tilted and then eroded to varying degrees depending on their strength. The Rocky Mountains of B.C. and Alberta are a good example of this, and many of the drainage systems within the Rockies have trellis patterns. <strong>Rectangular</strong> patterns develop in areas that have very little topography and a system of bedding planes, fractures, or faults that form a rectangular network. Rectangular drainage patterns are rare in Canada.</p> <p>In many parts of Canada, especially relatively flat areas with thick glacial sediments, and throughout much of Canadian Shield in eastern and central Canada, drainage patterns are chaotic, or what is known as <strong>deranged</strong> (Figure 13.8, left). Lakes and wetlands are common in this type of environment.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_800" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-800" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/dendritic.png"><img width="400" height="166" class="wp-image-800" alt="Figure 13.7 Typical dendritic, trellis, and rectangular stream drainage patterns.

[SE]</div></div> <p>A fourth type of drainage pattern, which is not specific to a drainage basin, is known as <strong>radial</strong> (Figure 13.8, right). Radial patterns form around isolated mountains (such as volcanoes) or hills, and the individual streams typically have dendritic drainage patterns.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_996" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-996" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/deranged-radial-2.png"><img width="300" height="145" class="size-medium wp-image-996" alt="Figure 13.8 Left: a typical deranged pattern; right: a typical radial drainage pattern developed around a mountain or hill.

If we compare this with an ungraded stream like Cawston Creek (Figure 13.5), we can see that graded streams are steepest in their headwaters and their gradient gradually decreases toward their mouths. Ungraded streams have steep sections at various points, and typically have rapids and waterfalls at numerous locations along their lengths.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_802" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-802" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/typical-graded-stream.png"><img width="400" height="123" class="wp-image-802" alt="Figure 13.9 The topographic profile of a typical graded stream.

As stated earlier, the base level of Cawston Creek is defined by the level of the Similkameen River, but this can change, and has done so in the past. Figure 13.10 shows the valley of the Similkameen River in the Keremeos area. The river channel is just beyond the row of trees. The green field in the distance is underlain by material eroded from the hills behind and deposited by a small creek (not Cawston Creek) adjacent to the Similkameen River when its level was higher than it is now. Sometime in the past several centuries, the Similkameen River eroded down through these deposits (forming the steep bank on the other side of the river), and the base level of the small creek was lowered by about 10 m. Over the next few centuries, this creek will seek to become graded again by eroding down through its own alluvial fan.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_803" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-803" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Similkameen-river.jpg"><img width="400" height="201" class="wp-image-803" alt="Figure 13.10 An example of a change in the base level of a small stream that flows into the Similkameen river near Keremeos.

Following tectonic uplift, streams erode quickly, developing deep V-shaped valleys that tend to follow relatively straight paths. Gradients are high, and profiles are ungraded. Rapids and waterfalls are common. During the mature stage, streams erode wider valleys and start to deposit thick sediment layers. Gradients are slowly reduced and grading increases. In old age, streams are surrounded by rolling hills, and they occupy wide sediment-filled valleys. Meandering patterns are common.</p> <p>Davis’s work was done long before the idea of plate tectonics, and he was not familiar with the impacts of glacial erosion on streams and their environments. While some parts of his theory are out of date, it is still a useful way to understand streams and their evolution.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_807" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-807" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Davis-cycle-of-erosion.png"><img width="600" height="209" class="wp-image-807" alt="Figure 13.13 A depiction of the Davis cycle of erosion: a: initial stage, b: youthful stage, c: mature stage, and d: old age.

Water flow in a stream is primarily related to the stream’s gradient, but it is also controlled by the geometry of the stream channel. As shown in Figure 13.14, water flow velocity is decreased by friction along the stream bed, so it is slowest at the bottom and edges and fastest near the surface and in the middle. In fact, the velocity just below the surface is typically a little higher than right at the surface because of friction between the water and the air. On a curved section of a stream, flow is fastest on the outside and slowest on the inside.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_999" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-999" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/meandering.png"><img width="300" height="110" class="size-medium wp-image-999" alt="Figure 13.14 The relative velocity of stream flow depending on whether the stream channel is straight or curved (left), and with respect to the water depth (right).

[SE]</div></div> <p>Other factors that affect stream-water velocity are the size of sediments on the stream bed — because large particles tend to slow the flow more than small ones — and the <strong>discharge</strong>, or volume of water passing a point in a unit of time (e.g., m<sup>3</sup>/second). During a flood, the water level always rises, so there is more cross-sectional area for the water to flow in; however, as long as a river remains confined to its channel, the velocity of the water flow also increases.</p> <p>Figure 13.15 shows the nature of sediment transportation in a stream. Large particles rest on the bottom — <strong>bedload</strong> — and may only be moved during rapid flows under flood conditions. They can be moved by <strong>saltation </strong>(bouncing) and by <strong>traction</strong> (being pushed along by the force of the flow).</p> <p>Smaller particles may rest on the bottom some of the time, where they can be moved by saltation and traction, but they can also be held in suspension in the flowing water, especially at higher velocities. As you know from intuition and from experience, streams that flow fast tend to be turbulent (flow paths are chaotic and the water surface appears rough) and the water may be muddy, while those that flow more slowly tend to have laminar flow (straight-line flow and a smooth water surface) and clear water. Turbulent flow is more effective than laminar flow at keeping sediments in suspension.</p> <p>Stream water also has a dissolved load, which represents (on average) about 15% of the mass of material transported, and includes ions such as calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>) and chloride (Cl-) in solution. The solubility of these ions is not affected by flow velocity.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_809" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-809" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/transportation-of-sediments.png"><img width="400" height="206" class="wp-image-809" alt="Figure 13.15 Modes of transportation of sediments and dissolved ions (represented by red dots with + and – signs) in a stream.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The faster the water is flowing, the larger the particles that can be kept in suspension and transported within the flowing water. However, as Swedish geographer Filip Hjulström discovered in the 1940s, the relationship between grain size and the likelihood of a grain being eroded, transported, or deposited is not as simple as one might imagine (Figure 13.16). Consider, for example, a 1 mm grain of sand. If it is resting on the bottom, it will remain there until the velocity is high enough to erode it, around 20 cm/s. But once it is in suspension, that same 1 mm particle will remain in suspension as long as the velocity doesn’t drop below 10 cm/s. For a 10 mm gravel grain, the velocity is 105 cm/s to be eroded from the bed but only 80 cm/s to remain in suspension.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_997" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-997" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/hulstrom-2.png"><img width="300" height="203" class="size-medium wp-image-997" alt="Figure 13.16 The Hjulström-Sundborg diagram showing the relationships between particle size and the tendency to be eroded, transported, or deposited at different current velocities" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/hulstrom-2-300x203.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-997">Figure 13.16 The Hjulström-Sundborg diagram showing the relationships between particle size and the tendency to be eroded, transported, or deposited at different current velocities</div></div> <p>On the other hand, a 0.01 mm silt particle only needs a velocity of 0.1 cm/s to remain in suspension, but requires 60 cm/s to be eroded. In other words, a tiny silt grain requires a greater velocity to be eroded than a grain of sand that is 100 times larger! For clay-sized particles, the discrepancy is even greater. In a stream, the most easily eroded particles are small sand grains between 0.2 mm and 0.5 mm. Anything smaller or larger requires a higher water velocity to be eroded and entrained in the flow. The main reason for this is that small particles, and especially the tiny grains of clay, have a strong tendency to stick together, and so are difficult to erode from the stream bed.</p> <p>It is important to be aware that a stream can both erode and deposit sediments at the same time. At 100 cm/s, for example, silt, sand, and medium gravel will be eroded from the stream bed and transported in suspension, coarse gravel will be held in suspension, pebbles will be both transported and deposited, and cobbles and boulders will remain stationary on the stream bed.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 13.3 Understanding the Hjulström-Sundborg Diagram</strong></p> <p>Refer to the Hjulström-Sundborg diagram (Figure 13.16) to answer these questions.</p> <p>1.

This is known as the bank-full stage, as shown in Figure 13.17. As soon as the flooding stream overtops its banks and occupies the wide area of its flood plain, the water has a much larger area to flow through and the velocity drops significantly.

This leads to erosion of the banks on the outside of the curve, deposition on the inside, and formation of a point bar (Figure 13.21).

Since that time, all of the land that makes up Richmond, Delta, and parts of New Westminster and south Surrey has formed from sediment from the Fraser River.

In Canada, most streams show discharge variability similar to that of the Stikine River in northwestern B.C., as illustrated in Figure 13.24. The Stikine River has its lowest discharge levels in the depths of winter when freezing conditions persist throughout most of its drainage basin. Discharge starts to rise slowly in May, and then rises dramatically through the late spring and early summer as a winter’s worth of snow melts. For the year shown, the minimum discharge on the Stikine River was 56 m3/s in March, and the maximum was 37 times higher, 2,470 m3/s, in May.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_820" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-820" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Stikine-River.png"><img width="400" height="146" class="wp-image-820" alt="Figure 13.24 Variations in discharge of the Stikine River during 2013.

The Qualicum River on Vancouver Island typically has its highest discharge levels in January or February and its lowest levels in late summer (Figure 13.25).

Rapidly flowing streams become muddy and large volumes of sediment are transported both in suspension and along the stream bed. In extreme situations, the water level reaches the top of the stream’s banks (the <strong>bank-full stage</strong>, see Figure 13.17), and if it rises any more, it floods the surrounding terrain. In the case of mature or old-age streams, this could include a vast area of relatively flat ground known as a flood plain, which is the area that is typically covered with water during a major flood. Because fine river sediments are deposited on flood plains, they are ideally suited for agriculture, and thus are typically occupied by farms and residences, and in many cases, by towns or cities. Such infrastructure is highly vulnerable to damage from flooding, and the people that live and work there are at risk.</p> <p>Most streams in Canada have the greatest risk of flooding in the late spring and early summer when stream discharges rise in response to melting snow. In some cases, this is exacerbated by spring storms. In years when melting is especially fast and/or spring storms are particularly intense, flooding can be very severe.</p> <p>One of the worst floods in Canadian history took place in the Fraser Valley in late May and early June of 1948. The early spring of that year had been cold, and a large snow pack in the interior was slow to melt. In mid-May, temperatures rose quickly and melting was accelerated by rainfall. Fraser River discharge levels rose rapidly over several days during late May, and the dykes built to protect the valley were breached in a dozen places. Approximately one-third of the flood plain was inundated and many homes and other buildings were destroyed, but there were no deaths. The Fraser River flood of 1948, which was the highest in the past century, was followed by very high river levels in 1950 and 1972 and by relatively high levels several times since then, the most recent being 2007 (Table 13.1). In the years following 1948, millions of dollars were spent repairing and raising the existing dykes and building new ones; since then damage from flooding in the Fraser Valley has been relatively limited.</p> <table><caption>Table13.1 Ranking of the maximum stage and discharge values for the Fraser River at Hope between 1948 and 2008.

In this case, the floods were caused by two weeks of heavy rainfall followed by one day of exceptional rainfall. July 19 saw 270 mm of rain, equivalent to the region’s normal rainfall for the entire month of July. Ten deaths were attributed to the Saguenay floods, and the economic toll was estimated at $1.5 billion.</p> <p>Just a year after the Saguenay floods, the Red River in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Manitoba reached its highest level since 1826. As is typical for the Red River, the 1997 flooding was due to rapid snowmelt. Because of the south to north flow of the river, the flooding starts in Minnesota and North Dakota, where melting starts earlier, and builds toward the north. The residents of Manitoba had plenty of warning that the 1997 flood was coming because there was severe flooding at several locations on the U.S. side of the border.</p> <p>After the 1950 Red River flood, the Manitoba government built a channel around the city of Winnipeg to reduce the potential of flooding in the city (Figure 13.26). Known as the Red River Floodway, the channel was completed in 1964 at a cost of $63 million. Since then it has been used many times to alleviate flooding in Winnipeg, and is estimated to have saved many billions of dollars in flood damage. The massive 1997 flood was almost too much for the floodway; in fact the amount of water diverted was greater than the designed capacity. The floodway has recently been expanded so that it can be used to divert more of the Red River’s flow away from Winnipeg.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1000" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/winnipeg-2.png"><img width="300" height="123" class="size-medium wp-image-1000" alt="Figure 13.26 Map of the Red River Floodway around Winnipeg, Manitoba (left), and aerial view of the southern (inlet) end of the floodway (right).

Its movement is powered by the sun and gravity.</td> </tr> <tr><th>13.2</th> <th>Drainage Basins</th> <td>All of the precipitation that falls within a drainage basin flows into the stream that drains that area. Stream drainage patterns are determined by the type of rock within the basin. Over geological time, streams change the landscape that they flow within, and eventually they become graded, meaning their profile is a smooth curve. A stream can lose that gradation if there is renewed uplift or if their base level changes for some reason.</td> </tr> <tr><th>13.3</th> <th>Stream Erosion and Deposition</th> <td>Erosion and deposition of particles within streams is primarily determined by the velocity of the water. Erosion and deposition of different-sized particles can happen at the same time. Some particles are moved along the bottom of a river while some are suspended in the water. It takes a greater velocity of water to erode a particle from a stream bed than it does to keep it in suspension. Ions are also transported in solution. When a stream rises and then occupies its flood plain, the velocity slows and natural levées form along the edges of the channel.</td> </tr> <tr><th>13.4</th> <th>Stream Types</th> <td>Youthful streams in steep areas erode rapidly, and they tend to have steep, rocky, and relatively straight channels. Where sediment-rich streams empty into areas with lower gradients, braided streams can form. In areas with even lower gradients, and where silt and sand are the dominant sediments, meanders are common. Deltas form where streams flow into standing water.</td> </tr> <tr><th>13.5</th> <th>Flooding</th> <td>Most streams in Canada have their highest discharge rates in spring and early summer, although many of B.C.’s coastal streams are highest in the winter. Floods happen when a stream rises high enough to spill over its banks and spread across its flood plain. Some of the more significant floods in Canada include the Fraser River flood of 1948, the Saguenay River flood of 1996, the Red River flood of 1997, and the Alberta floods of 2013. We can estimate the probability of a specific flood level based on the record of past floods, and we can take steps to minimize the impacts of flooding.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>What is the proportion of liquid (not frozen) <em>fresh</em> water on Earth expressed as a percentage of all water on Earth?</li> <li>What percentage of that fresh water is groundwater?</li> <li>What type of rock, and what processes, can lead to the formation of a trellis drainage pattern?</li> <li>Why do many of the streams in the southwestern part of Vancouver Island flow to the ocean as waterfalls?</li> <li>Where would you expect to find the fastest water flow on a straight stretch of a stream?</li> <li>Sand grains can be moved by traction and saltation.

We can’t live without water, and it’s easy to see that groundwater represents a critically important component of our water supply. Groundwater is not as easily accessed as surface water, but it is also not as easily contaminated as surface water. If more than 7 billion of us want to continue living comfortably here on Earth, we have to take great care of our groundwater and learn how to use it sustainably.</p></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-14-1-groundwater-and-aquifers" title="14.1 Groundwater and Aquifers"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">82</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">14.1 Groundwater and Aquifers</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>Groundwater is stored in the open spaces within rocks and within unconsolidated sediments. Rocks and sediments near the surface are under less pressure than those at significant depth and therefore tend to have more open space. For this reason, and because it’s expensive to drill deep wells, most of the groundwater that is accessed by individual users is within the first 100 m of the surface. Some municipal, agricultural, and industrial groundwater users get their water from greater depth, but deeper groundwater tends to be of lower quality than shallow groundwater, so there is a limit as to how deep we can go.</p> <p><strong>Porosity</strong> is the percentage of open space within an unconsolidated sediment or a rock. Primary porosity is represented by the spaces between grains in a sediment or sedimentary rock. Secondary porosity is porosity that has developed after the rock has formed. It can include fracture porosity — space within fractures in any kind of rock. Some volcanic rock has a special type of porosity related to vesicles, and some limestone has extra porosity related to cavities within fossils.</p> <p>Porosity is expressed as a percentage calculated from the volume of open space in a rock compared with the total volume of rock. The typical ranges in porosity of a number of different geological materials are shown in Figure 14.2. Unconsolidated sediments tend to have higher porosity than consolidated ones because they have no cement, and most have not been strongly compressed. Finer-grained materials (e.g., silt and clay) tend to have greater porosity — some as high as 70% — than coarser materials (e.g., gravel). Primary porosity tends to be higher in well-sorted sediments compared to poorly sorted sediments, where there is a range of smaller particles to fill the spaces made by the larger particles. Glacial till, which has a wide range of grain sizes and is typically formed under compression beneath glacial ice, has relatively low porosity.</p> <p>Consolidation and cementation during the process of lithification of unconsolidated sediments into sedimentary rocks reduces primary porosity. Sedimentary rocks generally have porosities in the range of 10% to 30%, some of which may be secondary (fracture) porosity. The grain size, sorting, compaction, and degree of cementation of the rocks all influence primary porosity. For example, poorly sorted and well-cemented sandstone and well-compressed mudstone can have very low porosity. Igneous or metamorphic rocks have the lowest primary porosity because they commonly form at depth and have interlocking crystals. Most of their porosity comes in the form of secondary porosity in fractures. Of the consolidated rocks, well-fractured volcanic rocks and limestone that has cavernous openings produced by dissolution have the highest potential porosity, while intrusive igneous and metamorphic rocks, which formed under great pressure, have the lowest.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-851" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Variations-in-porosity.png"><img class="wp-image-851" alt="Figure 14.2 Variations in porosity of unconsolidated materials (in red) and rocks (in blue) [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Variations-in-porosity.png" height="245" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-851">Figure 14.2 Variations in porosity of unconsolidated materials (in red) and rocks (in blue) [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Porosity is a measure of how much water can be stored in geological materials. Almost all rocks contain some porosity and therefore contain groundwater. Groundwater is found under your feet and everywhere on the planet. Considering that sedimentary rocks and unconsolidated sediments cover about 75% of the continental crust with an average thickness of a few hundred metres, and that they are likely to have around 20% porosity on average, it is easy to see that a huge volume of water can be stored in the ground.</p> <p>Porosity is a description of how much space there could be to hold water under the ground, and <strong>permeability</strong> describes how those pores are shaped and interconnected. This determines how easy it is for water to flow from one pore to the next. Larger pores mean there is less friction between flowing water and the sides of the pores. Smaller pores mean more friction along pore walls, but also more twists and turns for the water to have to flow-through. A permeable material has a greater number of larger, well-connected pores spaces, whereas an impermeable material has fewer, smaller pores that are poorly connected. Permeability is the most important variable in groundwater. Permeability describes how easily water can flow through the rock or unconsolidated sediment and how easy it will be to extract the water for our purposes. The characteristic of permeability of a geological material is quantified by geoscientists and engineers using a number of different units, but the most common is the <strong>hydraulic conductivity</strong>. The symbol used for hydraulic conductivity is <em>K</em>. Although hydraulic conductivity can be expressed in a range of different units, in this book, we will always use m/s.</p> <p>The materials in Figure 14.3 show that there is a wide range of permeability in geological materials from 10-12 m/s (0.000000000001 m/s) to around 1 m/s. Unconsolidated materials are generally more permeable than the corresponding rocks (compare sand with sandstone, for example), and the coarser materials are much more permeable than the finer ones. The least permeable rocks are unfractured intrusive igneous and metamorphic rocks, followed by unfractured mudstone, sandstone, and limestone. The permeability of sandstone can vary widely depending on the degree of sorting and the amount of cement that is present. Fractured igneous and metamorphic rocks, and especially fractured volcanic rocks, can be highly permeable, as can limestone that has been dissolved along fractures and bedding planes to create solutional openings.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_852" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-852" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Variations-in-hydraulic-conductivity.png"><img class="wp-image-852" alt="Figure 14.3 Variations in hydraulic conductivity (in metres/second) of unconsolidated materials (in red) and of rocks (in blue) [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Variations-in-hydraulic-conductivity.png" height="267" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-852">Figure 14.3 Variations in hydraulic conductivity (in metres/second) of unconsolidated materials (in red) and of rocks (in blue) [SE]</div></div> <h1>Why is clay porous but not permeable?</h1> <div class="wp-nocaption wp-image-853 aligncenter"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/clay.png"><img class="wp-image-853 aligncenter" alt="clay" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/clay.png" height="200" width="200" /></a></div> <p>Both sand and clay deposits (and sandstone and mudstone) are quite porous (30% to 50% for sand and 40% to 70% for silt and clay), but while sand can be quite permeable, clay and mudstone are not.</p> <p>The surface of most silicate mineral grains has a slight negative charge due to imperfections in the mineral structure. Water (H2O) is a polar molecule. This means that while it has no overall electrical charge, one side of the molecule has a slight positive charge (the side with the two hydrogens), compared to a slight negative charge on the other side. Water is strongly attracted to all mineral grains and water within that bound water layer (a few microns around each grain) is not able to move and flow along with the rest of the groundwater. In the lower diagrams shown here, the bound water is represented by dark blue lines around each grain and the water that can move is light blue. In the sand, there is still a lot of water that is able to move through the sediment, but in the clay/silt almost all of the water is held tightly to the grains and this reduces the permeability. [SE]</p> <p>We have now seen that there is a wide range of porosity in geological materials and an even wider range of permeability. Groundwater exists everywhere there is porosity. However, whether that groundwater is able to flow in significant quantities depends on the permeability. An <strong>aquifer</strong> is defined as a body of rock or unconsolidated sediment that has sufficient permeability to allow water to flow through it. Unconsolidated materials like gravel, sand, and even silt make relatively good aquifers, as do rocks like sandstone. Other rocks can be good aquifers if they are well fractured. An <strong>aquitard</strong> is a body that does not allow transmission of a significant amount of water, such as a clay, a till, or a poorly fractured igneous or metamorphic rock. These are relative terms, not absolute, and are usually defined based on someone’s desire to pump groundwater; what is an aquifer to someone who does not need a lot of water, may be an aquitard to someone else who does. An aquifer that is exposed at the ground surface is called an <strong>unconfined aquifer</strong>. An aquifer where there is a lower permeability material between the aquifer and the ground surface is known as a <strong>confined aquifer</strong>, and the aquitard separating ground surface and the aquifer is known as the <strong>confining layer</strong>.</p> <p>Figure 14.4 shows a cross-section of a series of rocks and unconsolidated materials, some of which might serve as aquifers and others as aquitards or confining layers. The granite is much less permeable than the other materials, and so is an aquitard in this context. The yellow layer is very permeable and would make an ideal aquifer. The overlying grey layer is a confining layer.</p> <p>The upper buff-coloured layer (<em>K</em> = 10-2 m/s) does not have a confining layer and is an unconfined aquifer. The yellow layer (<em>K</em> = 10-1 m/s) is “confined” by the confining layer (<em>K</em> = 10-4 m/s), and is a confined aquifer. The confined aquifer gets most of its water from the upper part of the hill where it is exposed at the surface, and relatively little by seepage through the fine silt layer.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-854" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/aquifers-and-confining-layers.png"><img class="wp-image-854" alt="Figure 14.4 A cross-section showing materials that might serve as aquifers and confining layers.

This means that some of the pore space in the soil is occupied by water, and some of the pore space is occupied by air (unless you’re in a swamp). This is known as the <strong>unsaturated zone</strong>. If you could dig down far enough, you would get to the point where all of the pore spaces are 100% filled with water (saturated) and the bottom of your hole would fill up with water. The level of water in the hole represents the <strong>water table</strong>, which is the surface of the <strong>saturated zone</strong>. In most parts of British Columbia, the water table is several metres below the surface.</p> <p>Water falling on the ground surface as precipitation (rain, snow, hail, fog, etc.) may flow off a hill slope directly to a stream in the form of <strong>runoff</strong>, or it may <strong>infiltrate</strong> the ground, where it is stored in the unsaturated zone. The water in the unsaturated zone may be used by plants (transpiration), evaporate from the soil (evaporation), or continue past the root zone and flow downward to the water table, where it <strong>recharges</strong> the groundwater.</p> <p>A cross-section of a typical hillside with an unconfined aquifer is illustrated in Figure 14.5. In areas with topographic relief, the water table generally follows the land surface, but tends to come closer to surface in valleys, and intersects the surface where there are streams or lakes. The water table can be determined from the depth of water in a well that isn’t being pumped, although, as described below, that only applies if the well is within an unconfined aquifer. In this case, most of the hillside forms the <strong>recharge area</strong>, where water from precipitation flows downward through the unsaturated zone to reach the water table. The area at the stream or lake to which the groundwater is flowing is a <strong>discharge area</strong>.</p> <p>What makes water flow from the recharge areas to the discharge areas? Recall that water is flowing in pores where there is friction, which means it takes work to move the water. There is also some friction between water molecules themselves, which is determined by the viscosity. Water has a low viscosity, but friction is still a factor. All flowing fluids are always losing energy to friction with their surroundings. Water will flow from areas with high energy to those with low energy. Recharge areas are at higher elevations, where the water has high gravitational energy. It was energy from the sun that evaporated the water into the atmosphere and lifted it up to the recharge area. The water loses this gravitational energy as it flows from the recharge area to the discharge area.</p> <p>In Figure 14.5, the water table is sloping; that slope represents the change in gravitational potential energy of the water at the water table. The water table is higher under the recharge area (90 m) and lower at the discharge area (82 m). Imagine how much work it would be to lift water 8 m high in the air. That is the energy that was lost to friction as the groundwater flowed from the top of the hill to the stream.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-855" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/water-table.png"><img class="wp-image-855" alt="Figure 14.5 A depiction of the water table in cross-section, with the saturated zone below and the unsaturated zone above.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The situation gets a lot more complicated in the case of confined aquifers, but they are important sources of water so we need to understand how they work. As shown in Figure 14.6, there is always a water table, and that applies even if the geological materials at the surface have very low permeability. Where there is a confined aquifer — meaning one that is separated from the surface by a confining layer — this aquifer will have its own “water table,” which is actually called a <strong>potentiometric surface</strong>, as it is a measure of the total potential energy of the water. The red dashed line in Figure 14.6 is the potentiometric surface for the confined aquifer, and it describes the total energy that water is under within the confined aquifer. If we drill a well into the unconfined aquifer, the water will rise to the level of the water table (well A in Figure 14.6). But if we drill a well through both the unconfined aquifer and the confining layer and into the confined aquifer, the water will rise above the top of the confined aquifer to the level of its potentiometric surface (well B in Figure 14.6). This is known as an <strong>artesian well</strong>, because the water rises above the top of the aquifer. In some situations, the potentiometric surface may be above the ground level. The water in a well drilled into the confined aquifer in this situation would rise above ground level, and flow out, if it’s not capped (well C in Figure 14.6). This is known as a <strong>flowing</strong> <strong>artesian well</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-856" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/water-table-and-the-potentiometric-surface.png"><img class="wp-image-856" alt="Figure 14.6 A depiction of the water table and the potentiometric surface of a confined aquifer.

Although perched aquifers may be good water sources at some times of the year, they tend to be relatively thin and small, and so can easily be depleted with over-pumping.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-857" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/perched-aquifer.png"><img class="wp-image-857" alt="Figure 14.7 A perched aquifer above a regular unconfined aquifer.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>In 1856, French engineer Henri Darcy carried out some experiments from which he derived a method for estimating the rate of groundwater flow based on the hydraulic gradient and the permeability of an aquifer, expressed using <em>K</em>, the hydraulic conductivity. Darcy’s equation, which has been used widely by hydrogeologists ever since, looks like this:</p> <p><em>V</em> = <em>K</em> * <em>i</em></p> <p>(where <em>V</em> is the velocity of the groundwater flow, <em>K</em> is the hydraulic conductivity, and <em>i</em> is the hydraulic gradient).</p> <p>We can apply this equation to the scenario in Figure 14.5. If we assume that the permeability is 0.00001 m/s we get: <em>V</em> = 0.00001 * 0.08 = 0.0000008 m/s. That is equivalent to 0.000048 m/min, 0.0029 m/hour or 0.069 m/day. That means it would take 1,450 days (nearly four years) for water to travel the 100 m from the vicinity of the well to the stream. Groundwater moves slowly, and that is a reasonable amount of time for water to move that distance. In fact it would likely take longer than that, because it doesn’t travel in a straight line.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 14.1 How Long Will It Take?</strong></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/How-Long-Will-It-Take.png"><img class="wp-image-858 aligncenter" alt="How Long Will It Take" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/How-Long-Will-It-Take.png" height="225" width="300" /></a>Sue, the owner of Joe’s 24-Hour Gas, has discovered that her underground storage tank (UST) is leaking fuel.

[SE drawing]</p> </div> </div> <p>It’s critical to understand that groundwater does not flow in underground streams, nor does it form underground lakes. With the exception of <strong>karst</strong> areas, with caves in limestone, groundwater flows very slowly through granular sediments, or through solid rock that has fractures in it. Flow velocities of several centimetres per day are possible in significantly permeable sediments with significant hydraulic gradients. But in many cases, permeabilities are lower than the ones we’ve used as examples here, and in many areas, gradients are much lower. It is not uncommon for groundwater to flow at velocities of a few millimetres to a few centimetres per year.<strong> </strong></p> <p>As already noted, groundwater does not flow in straight lines. It flows from areas of higher hydraulic head to areas of lower hydraulic head, and this means that it can flow “uphill” in many situations. This is illustrated in Figure 14.8. The dashed orange lines are <strong>equipotential, </strong> meaning lines of equal pressure. The blue lines are the predicted groundwater <strong>flow paths</strong>. The dashed lines red lines are no-flow boundaries, meaning that water cannot flow across these lines. That’s not because there is something there to stop it, but because there’s no pressure gradient that will cause water to flow in that direction.</p> <p>Groundwater flows at right angles to the equipotential lines in the same way that water flowing down a slope would flow at right angles to the contour lines. The stream in this scenario is the location with the lowest hydraulic potential, so the groundwater that flows to the lower parts of the aquifer has to flow upward to reach this location. It is forced upward by the pressure differences, for example, the difference between the 112 and 110 equipotential lines.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-859" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/unconfined-aquifer.png"><img class="wp-image-859" alt="Figure 14.8 Predicted equipotential lines (orange) and groundwater flow paths (blue) in an unconfined aquifer.

Caves above the water table are air-filled conduits, and the water that flows within these conduits is not under pressure; it responds only to gravity. In other words, it flows downhill along the gradient of the cave floor (Figure 14.9). Many limestone caves also extend below the water table and into the saturated zone. Here water behaves in a similar way to any other groundwater, and it flows according to the hydraulic gradient and Darcy’s law.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-860" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/limestone-karst-region.png"><img class="wp-image-860" alt="Figure 14.9 Groundwater in a limestone karst region.

There are many types of drills that can be used; an example is shown in Figure 14.10. A well has to be drilled at least as deep as the water table, but in fact must go much deeper; first, because the water table may change from season to season and from year to year, and second, because when water is being pumped, the water level will drop, at least temporarily.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1007" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1007" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/well-drilling-2.png"><img width="300" height="144" class="size-medium wp-image-1007" alt="Figure 14.10 A water-well drilling rig in operation in the Cassidy area, near Nanaimo, B.C.

A specially designed well screen is installed at the bottom of the casing. The size of the holes in the screen is carefully chosen to make sure that it allows the water to move into the well freely, but prevents aquifer particles from entering the well. A submersible pump is typically used to lift water from within the well up to the where it is needed. The well shown in Figure 14.10 has casing that is about 40 cm in diameter, which might be typical for a municipal water supply well, or a very large well for irrigation. Most domestic wells have 15 cm casing.</p> <p>Pumping water from the well removes water from inside the well at first. That lowers the water level inside the well. This means that water will flow from the surrounding aquifer (higher groundwater head) toward the pumping well where the groundwater head is now lower. That is how a well gets water from the ground. The water table, or potentiometric surface, will slope in toward the well where the water is being withdrawn. That indicates the energy gradient that is allowing water to flow toward the well. This creates a shape known as a <strong>cone of depression</strong> surrounding the well, as illustrated in Figure 14.11. If pumping from a well continues for hours to days, the cone of depression may result in a loss of water in nearby wells.

The data for part of the period are shown in more detail in Figure 14.15. On Vancouver Island, most wells drop to their lowest levels in September or October after the long dry summer period. Levels increase rapidly from October through February as high winter precipitation adds recharge to the aquifer, and water is stored. The water table reaches a peak in March or April. Most wells then drop over the summer as groundwater continues to flow, but no new recharge is added. The water is drained from storage into streams or lakes and eventually into the ocean, and as a result, the water table decreases, reaching its lowest level again in September or October. Similar fluctuations are observed at most observations wells around the province, although the timing is slightly different from region to region.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_867" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-867" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/1996-to-2000.png"><img width="400" height="163" class="wp-image-867" alt="Figure 14.15 Water level data for B.C. observation well 232 for the period 1996 to 2000, showing seasonal variations [SE from data at: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/data_searches/obswell/map/]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/1996-to-2000.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-867">Figure 14.15 Water level data for B.C. observation well 232 for the period 1996 to 2000, showing seasonal variations [SE from data at: http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wsd/data_searches/obswell/map/]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The long-term fluctuations in levels in observation wells around the province are also quite variable. Long-term changes in climate can lead to gradual natural changes in water levels. These long-term cycles lasting years or decades are mixed with the effects of well pumping. Some observation wells show consistent decreases in water level that may indicate long-term over-extraction. Many others show generally consistent levels over several decades, and some show increases in water level. One of the important jobs performed by hydrogeologists working for different government ministries is to examine these long-term records of water levels for indications of how sustainable the groundwater use might be.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 14.3 What’s Your Water Table Doing?</strong></p> <p>Visit the B.C.

This comes into effect in January 2016. The new Act also includes provisions for determining “environmental flow needs” — the amount of water that must be in surface water streams at different times of the year to meet the needs of the ecosystem that depends on the streamflow. For example, many streams in B.C. support populations of salmon that live in the stream for part of their life cycle or return to their home stream for spawning. Groundwater forms a part of the <strong>baseflow</strong> in a watershed, and is therefore an important part of the environmental flow needs. Careful work is needed in the coming years to ensure that the amount of water licensed to be extracted from surface water and groundwater for human use does not interfere with the amount of water needed for the natural water-dependent ecosystems to function.</p> <p>The situation in California, where groundwater extraction over large areas is leading to declining water levels, is quite different from that in B.C. According to the state Department of Water Resources, 80% of groundwater wells showed drops in water level of 0 m to 7.5 m between 2011 and 2013, another 6% dropped by 7.5 m to 15 m, and 3% dropped by more than 15 m (Figure 14.16). Over the same time period, only 10% of well levels increased by 0 m to 7.5 m, and 1% increased by more than 7.5 m. The drought that gripped California in 2013 had worsened significantly by 2015, and California farmers — and the people across North America that eat the food they produce — continue to have a prodigious appetite for irrigation water. California, like B.C., is introducing new groundwater regulations to try to control water usage and halt water table declines.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-868" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Changes-in-water-levels.png"><img width="400" height="168" class="wp-image-868" alt="Figure 14.16 Changes in water levels in wells in California over the period from 2011 to 2013 [SE from State of California Department of Water Resources data]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Changes-in-water-levels.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.16 Changes in water levels in wells in California from 2011 to 2013 [SE from State of California Department of Water Resources data]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><strong>Impermeable Surfaces</strong></h1> <p>Even if groundwater supplies are not being depleted by overuse, or by a changing climate, we are continuing to put stress on aquifers by covering vast areas with impermeable surfaces that don’t allow rain and snowmelt to infiltrate and become groundwater. Instead, water that falls on these surfaces is channelled into drainage systems, then into storm sewers, and then directly into rivers and the ocean. In cities and their suburbs, the biggest culprits are parking lots, roads, and highways. While it would great if we didn’t dedicate such huge areas to cars, that’s not about to change quickly, so we need to think about ways that we can improve surface water infiltration in cities. One way is to use road and parking surfaces that will allow water to seep through, although this is not practical in many cases. Another way is to ensure that runoff from pavement is channelled into existing or constructed wetlands that serve to decontaminate the water, and then allow it to infiltrate into the ground.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-14-4-groundwater-quality" title="14.4 Groundwater Quality"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">85</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">14.4 Groundwater Quality</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>As was noted at the very beginning of this chapter, one of the good things about groundwater as a source of water is that it is not as easily contaminated as surface water is. But there are two caveats to that: one is that groundwater can become naturally contaminated because of its very close connection to the materials of its aquifer, and the second is that once contaminated by human activities, groundwater is very difficult to clean up.</p> <h1><strong>Natural Contamination of Groundwater</strong></h1> <p>Groundwater moves slowly through an aquifer, and unlike the surface water of a stream, it has a lot of contact with the surrounding rock or sediment. In most aquifers, the geological materials that make up the aquifer are relatively inert, or are made up of minerals that dissolve very slowly into the groundwater. Over time, however, all groundwater gradually has more and more material dissolved within it as it remains in contact with the aquifer. In some areas, that rock or sediment includes some minerals that could potentially contaminate the water with elements that might make the water less than ideal for human consumption or agricultural use. Examples include copper, arsenic, mercury, fluorine, sodium, and boron. In some cases, contamination may occur because the aquifer material has particularly high levels of the element in question. In other cases, the aquifer material is just normal rock or sediment, but some particular feature of the water or the aquifer allows the contaminant to build up to significant levels.</p> <p>An example of natural contamination takes place in the bedrock aquifers of the east coast of Vancouver Island and the adjacent Gulf Islands. The aquifer is the Cretaceous (90 Ma to 65 Ma) Nanaimo Group, which is made up of sandstone, mudstone, and conglomerate (Figure 14.17).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-869" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-sandstone.jpg"><img width="400" height="153" class="wp-image-869" alt="Cretaceous Nanaimo Group sandstone" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Cretaceous-Nanaimo-Group-sandstone.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.17 Cretaceous Nanaimo Group sandstone exposed in a Nanaimo parking lot [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The rocks of the Nanaimo Group are not particularly enriched in any trace elements, but the submarine-fan sandstone that makes up much of the group is a lithic wacke, and therefore has relatively high levels of clay (for a sandstone). This clay is good at adsorbing<span class="footnote">“Adsorb” (with a “d”) is not the same as “absorb” (with a “b”). Water can be absorbed by a sponge. Ions dissolved in water can be adsorbed onto — or desorbed from — the surfaces of clay minerals.</span> some elements from the water and desorbing others, and in the process, its pH goes up (it becomes alkaline). At high pH levels (some as high as 9 in the Nanaimo Group), the element fluorine that is present naturally in the rock (as it is in almost any rock) has an increased tendency to dissolve in the water. In some areas, groundwater in the Nanaimo Group has fluorine levels that are well above recommended levels for drinking water. The World Health Organization (WHO) maximum acceptable concentration (MAC) for fluorine is 1.5 mg/L (milligrams per litre). Between 5% and 10% of the domestic wells around Nanaimo and adjacent Gabriola Island have more than that, some as much as 10 mg/L. A small amount of fluorine in the human diet is considered important for maintaining dental health, but high levels can lead to malformation and discolouration of teeth, and long-term exposure can lead to other more serious health effects such as skeletal problems.</p> <p>Nanaimo Group groundwater can also have elevated levels of boron, again related to pH and adsorption from clay minerals. While boron at the levels found there is not toxic to humans, there is enough boron in some wells to be toxic to plants, and the water cannot be used for irrigation.</p> <p>Rural residents in the densely populated country of Bangladesh (over 1,000 residents/km2, compared with 3.4/km2 in Canada) used to rely mostly on surface supplies for their drinking water, and many of these were subject to bacterial contamination. Infant mortality rates were among the highest in the world and other illnesses such as diarrhea, dysentery, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis were common. In the 1970s, international agencies, including UNICEF, started a program of drilling wells to access abundant groundwater supplies at depths of 20 m to 100 m. Eventually over 8 million such wells were drilled. Infant mortality and illness rates dropped dramatically, but it was later discovered that the water from a high proportion of these wells has arsenic above safe levels (Figure 14.18).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_870" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-870" style="width: 299px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-arsenic.png"><img width="299" height="400" class="wp-image-870" alt="Figure 14.18 The distribution of arsenic in groundwater in Bangladesh.

While these sediments are not particularly enriched in arsenic, they have enough organic matter in them to use up any oxygen present. This leads to water with a naturally low oxidation potential (anoxic conditions); arsenic is highly soluble under these conditions, and so any arsenic present in the sediments easily gets dissolved into the groundwater. Arsenic poisoning leads to headaches, confusion, and diarrhea, and eventually to vomiting, stomach pain, and convulsions. If not treated, the final outcomes are heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, coma, and death. There are ways to treat arsenic-rich groundwater, but it is a challenge in Bangladesh to implement the simple and effective technology that is available.</p> <h1><strong>Anthropogenic Contamination of Groundwater</strong></h1> <p>Groundwater can become contaminated by pollution at the surface (or at depth), and there are many different anthropogenic (human-caused) sources of contamination.</p> <p>The vulnerability of aquifers to pollution depends on several factors, including the depth to the water table, the permeability of the material between the surface and the aquifer, the permeability of the aquifer, the slope of the surface, and the amount of precipitation. Confined aquifers tend to be much less vulnerable than unconfined ones, and deeper aquifers are less vulnerable than shallow ones. Steeper slopes mean that surface water tends to run off rather than infiltrate (and this can reduce the possibility of contamination). Contamination risk is also less in dry areas than in areas with heavy rainfall.</p> <p>Studies of groundwater vulnerability have been completed for various regions of British Columbia. A groundwater vulnerability map for southern Vancouver Island is shown in Figure 14.19. The yellow to red areas are considered to have high vulnerability to pollution from surface sources, and most of these are where the aquifers are unconfined in quite permeable unconsolidated sediments of either glacial or fluvial origin, where the water table is relatively shallow and the terrain is relatively flat.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_871" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-871" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/anthropogenic-contamination.png"><img width="400" height="226" class="wp-image-871" alt="Figure 14.19 The vulnerability to anthropogenic contamination of aquifers on southern Vancouver Island.

An example of agricultural contamination is in the Abbotsford area of the Fraser Valley, where nitrate levels above the 44 mg/L maximum acceptable level (expressed as nitrate) in the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer have been observed since the 1950s; however, the problem became much worse as agriculture intensity increased in the 1980s. By 2004, groundwater with nitrate levels in excess of 44 mg/L was reported over an area of about 75 km2 around Abbotsford, and the problem extended across the border into the Sumas area of Washington State.</p> <p>This region is intensively used for berry crops (especially raspberries and blueberries) and large poultry operations, as well as lesser amounts of grazing and forage crops. Chicken manure is typically stored in fields adjacent to chicken barns, and may release nitrogen to the environment from runoff water, and from releases of ammonia gas. Over decades, both chemical fertilizers and chicken manure and other manures have been applied to the berry crops to provide extra nitrogen to help maximize berry growth. If the fertilizer added is in excess of what the plants need, or is poorly timed compared to when it is needed, then the extra nitrogen may be leached into the groundwater below. Berry crops are irrigated over the summer to help the crops grow. Summer irrigation and winter rainfall may carry excess nitrate from the near surface to the aquifer below.</p> <p>Since the 1990s, agricultural practices have been tightened up to reduce the rate of groundwater contamination, but it will take decades for nitrate levels to drop in the Abbotsford-Sumas aquifer. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and many others are conducting research on better irrigation and nitrate management techniques to reduce the amount of nitrogen that leaches to groundwater.</p> <h1><strong>Landfills</strong></h1> <p>In the past, domestic and commercial refuse was commonly trucked to a “dump” (typically a hole in the ground), and when the hole was filled, it was covered with soil and forgotten. In situations like this, rain and melting snow can easily pass through the soil used to cover the refuse. This water passes into the waste itself, and the resulting landfill <strong>leachate</strong> that flows from the bottom of the landfill can seriously contaminate the surrounding groundwater and surface water. In the past few decades, regulations around refuse disposal have been significantly strengthened, and important steps have been taken to reduce the amount of landfill waste by diverting recyclable and compostable materials to other locations.</p> <p>A modern engineered landfill has an impermeable liner (typically heavy plastic, although engineered clay liners or natural clay may be adequate in some cases), a plumbing system for draining leachate (the rainwater that flows through the refuse and becomes contaminated), and a network of monitoring wells both within and around the landfill (Figure 14.20). Once part or all of a landfill site is full, it is sealed over with a plastic cover, and a system is put in place to extract <strong>landfill gas</strong> (typically a mixture of carbon dioxide and methane). That gas can be sent to a nearby location where it is burned to create heat or used to generate electricity. The leachate must be treated, and that can be done in a normal sewage treatment plant.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_872" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-872" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/typical-modern-landfill.png"><img width="400" height="167" class="wp-image-872" alt="Figure 14.20 A cross-section of a typical modern landfill [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/typical-modern-landfill.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-872">Figure 14.20 A cross-section of a typical modern landfill [SE]</div></div> <p>The monitoring wells are used to assess the level of the water table around the landfill and to collect groundwater samples so that any leakage can be detected. Because some leakage is almost inevitable, the ideal placement for landfills is in areas where the depth to the water table is significant (tens of metres if possible) and where the aquifer material is relatively impermeable. Landfills should also be situated far from streams, lakes, or wetlands so that contamination of aquatic habitats can be avoided.</p> <p>Today there are hundreds of abandoned dumps scattered across the country; most have been left to contaminate groundwater that we might wish to use sometime in the future. In many cases, it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to do so.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 14.4 What Goes on at Your Landfill? </strong></p> <p>Unless you live in a remote rural area, there’s a good chance that the refuse you can’t recycle is picked up at the curb and taken to a landfill.

One example is the lead and zinc smelter at Trail, B.C. The largest in the world, it has been operating for over 100 years and has left a residue of metal contamination around the region (Figure 14.21). In some parts of Trail, the contamination is serious enough that existing soil has been removed from residential properties and replaced with clean soil brought in from elsewhere. This contaminated soil has contributed to contamination of groundwater in the Trail area. Groundwater beneath the actual smelter site is contaminated, and the operator (Teck Resources) is currently working on plans to prevent that water from reaching the nearby Columbia River.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-874" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/lead-zinc-smelter.png"><img width="400" height="244" class="wp-image-874" alt="  Figure 14.21 The Trail lead-zinc smelter in 1929 [http://upload.wikimedia.org /wikipedia/commons/2/20 /Trail_Smelter_in_Year_1929.png]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/lead-zinc-smelter.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.21 The Trail lead-zinc smelter in 1929<br />[http://upload.wikimedia.org /wikipedia/commons/2/20 /Trail_Smelter_in_Year_1929.png]</div></div> <p><strong> </strong></p> <h1><strong>Mines, Quarries, and Rock Excavations</strong></h1> <p>Mines and other operations that involve the excavation of large amounts of rock (e.g., highway construction) have the potential to create serious environmental damage. The exposure of rock that has previously not been exposed to air and water can lead to the oxidation of sulphide-bearing minerals, such a pyrite (FeS2), within the rock. The combination of pyrite, water, oxygen, and a special type of bacteria (<em>Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans</em>) that thrives in acidic conditions leads to the generation of acidity, in some cases to pH less than 2. Water that acidic is hazardous by itself, but the low pH also has the property of increasing the solubility of certain heavy metals. The water that is generated by this process is known as acid rock drainage (ARD). ARD can occur naturally where sulphide-bearing rocks are near the surface. The issue of ARD is a major environmental concern at both operating mines and abandoned mines (see Chapter 20). In streams around the Mt. Washington Mine on Vancouver Island (Figure 14.22), copper levels are high enough to be toxic to fish. Groundwater adjacent to the contaminated streams in the area is very likely contaminated as well.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-875" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Acidic-runoff.jpg"><img width="400" height="200" class="wp-image-875" alt="Figure 14.22 Acidic runoff at the abandoned Mt.

They do not last forever, and eventually they start to leak their contents into the ground. This is a particular problem at older gas stations — although it may also become a future problem at newer gas stations. You may have noticed gas stations that have been closed and then surrounded by chain-link fence (Figure 14.23). In virtually all such cases the closure has been triggered by the discovery of leaking USTs and the requirement to cease operations and remediate the site.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-876" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/fenced-gas-station-site.jpg"><img width="400" height="183" class="wp-image-876" alt="Figure 14.23 A closed and fenced gas station site in Nanaimo, B.C.

As a result, a petroleum spill is like several spills for the price of one. The petroleum liquid slowly settles through the unsaturated zone and then tends to float on the surface of the groundwater (Figure 14.24). The more readily soluble components of the spill dissolve in the groundwater and are dispersed along with the normal groundwater flow, and the more volatile components of the spill rise toward the surface, potentially contaminating buildings.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_877" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-877" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/petroleum-spill.png"><img width="400" height="183" class="wp-image-877" alt="Figure 14.24 A depiction of the fate of different components of a petroleum spill from an underground storage tank.

There are two primary components to a simple septic system, the septic tank and the drainage field (Figure 14.25). A typical septic tank is constructed of either concrete or plastic and has a volume of 5,000 L to 10,000 L (5 m3 to 10 m3). This forms the first treatment and is designed to be <strong>anaerobic</strong> (without oxygen). That promotes the activity of certain bacteria that help break down the waste. As the waste is degraded, some portions tend to sink to form sludge at the base of the tank, and others float to the surface, forming a scum layer. A septic tank may be divided into two parts to keep the sludge at the bottom and the scum on the top from draining out. The water then moves to the drainage field, which provides the right conditions for a different set of bacteria that operate in <strong>aerobic</strong> conditions. The drainage field includes an array of plastic pipes that are perforated to allow the effluent to drain out over a large area and seep slowly into the ground. In order to install a drainage field, it is first necessary to test the soil below, as it must be sufficiently permeable to allow the effluent to percolate away, but not so permeable that it flows too quickly and the soil is not able to filter out the pathogenic bacteria.</p> <p>If they are properly installed and used, and if the sludge is periodically removed from the tank, a septic system should be effective in treating the sewage for decades. The anaerobic and aerobic bacteria should be able to break down the incoming waste and there should be little risk to the surface environment or groundwater. But many things can go wrong with a septic system, including the following:</p> <ul><li>If inappropriate chemicals are added to the waste stream, they may interfere with the natural breakdown of the sewage.</li> <li>If the tank is not periodically pumped out, solids can get into the drainage field and compromise the drainage, resulting in the flow of effluent toward the surface.</li> <li>If the soil is either not sufficiently permeable or too permeable, the effluent will not drain away (and will start to pool at the surface) or it will drain too quickly.</li> <li>If the drainage field is constructed in an area where the water table is close to surface, some of the effluent is likely to flow into the groundwater without being treated.</li> </ul> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_878" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-878" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/septic-system.png"><img width="400" height="194" class="wp-image-878" alt="Figure 14.25 A typical septic system.

One is to prevent rainwater from infiltrating down to the water table and picking up contaminants; this can be achieved by simply capping or roofing over the landfill, mine tailings, or spill site. The second is to provide an impermeable barrier beneath the contaminant. Modern landfills and mine tailings impoundments are all built using some combination of clay and engineered plastic barriers. Both of these solutions — caps and liners — are subject to failure due to leaks.</p> <p>Once contaminants are in the groundwater, the main form of remediation is to pump out the contaminated water and treat it at the surface. This can be a slow process, and preventing the contaminant from travelling significantly during this process can be accomplished by manipulating local groundwater flow through the extraction or injection of water at certain locations. Consider this in the exercise below.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 14.6 Manipulating a Contaminant Plume</strong></p> <p>This diagram shows a groundwater contaminant plume in red.

An aquifer is a body of rock or sediment that has sufficient permeability for water to be extracted, while an aquitard is an impermeable body. An aquifer is described as confined if it is overlain by an impermeable layer (confining layer), or unconfined if it has no such confining layer.</td> </tr> <tr><th>14.2</th> <th>Groundwater Flow</th> <td>The water table is the upper surface of the saturated zone in an unconfined aquifer. A confined aquifer has a potentiometric surface (instead of a water table), which is defined as the level to which water would rise if a well were drilled into the confined aquifer. Change in groundwater head over distance is the hydraulic gradient. The theoretical velocity of flow in an aquifer is defined by Darcy’s law as the hydraulic conductivity (a measure of permeability) times the hydraulic gradient (<em>V</em> = <em>K * i</em>). It is possible to predict groundwater flow paths if we can draw equipotential lines within an aquifer. In areas where limestone has solutional openings (e.g., caves), water flow is determined by gravity above the water table and by the hydraulic gradient below the water table.</td> </tr> <tr><th>14.3</th> <th>Groundwater Extraction</th> <td>Groundwater can be extracted at springs, but in most cases, wells are needed to ensure a steady supply. Pumping groundwater from a well lowers groundwater head near the well, creating flow toward the well. This creates a cone of depression around the well. Excessive pumping can lead to a well running dry or to a lack of water in nearby wells. During extended periods of dry weather, or if consistent over-pumping occurs, aquifers may be depleted. Observation wells are used to monitor short-term and long-term changes in water levels that can indicate changes in aquifer health.</td> </tr> <tr><th>14.4</th> <th>Groundwater Quality</th> <td>The quality of groundwater can be compromised by both natural and anthropogenic contamination. Natural contamination can be caused by particularly high levels of contaminants within the aquifer itself, but is more commonly a result of enhanced solubility of contaminants due to the aquifer chemistry. Some common sources of anthropogenic contamination include agriculture, industry, mining, landfills, and leaking underground storage tanks. We can assess the vulnerability of aquifers to contamination by mapping regional variations in parameters such as depth to the water table, permeability, slope, and precipitation.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

The initial failure is thought to have taken place along the foliation planes and sill within the area shown in the inset. [SE]</div></div> <p>Early in the morning on January 9, 1965, 47 million cubic metres of rock broke away from the steep upper slopes of Johnson Peak (16 km southeast of Hope) and roared 2,000 m down the mountain, gouging out the contents of a small lake at the bottom, and continuing a few hundred metres up the other side (Figure 15.1). Four people, who had been stopped on the highway by a snow avalanche, were killed. Many more might have become victims, except that a Greyhound bus driver, en route to Vancouver, turned his bus around on seeing the avalanche. The rock failed along weakened foliation planes of the metamorphic rock on Johnson Peak, in an area that had been eroded into a steep slope by glacial ice. There is no evidence that it was triggered by any specific event, and there was no warning that it was about to happen. Even if there had been warning, nothing could have been done to prevent it. There are hundreds of similar situations throughout British Columbia.</p> <p>What can we learn from the Hope Slide? In general, we cannot prevent most mass wasting, and significant effort is required if an event is to be predicted with any level of certainty. Understanding the geology is critical to understanding mass wasting. Although failures are inevitable in a region with steep slopes, larger ones happen less frequently than smaller ones, and the consequences vary depending on the downslope conditions, such as the presence of people, buildings, roads, or fish-bearing streams.</p> <p>An important reason for learning about mass wasting is to understand the nature of the materials that fail, and how and why they fail so that we can minimize risks from similar events in the future. For this reason, we need to be able to classify mass-wasting events, and we need to know the terms that geologists, engineers, and others use to communicate about them.</p> <p><strong>Mass wasting</strong>, which is synonymous with “slope failure,” is the failure and downslope movement of rock or unconsolidated materials in response to gravity. The term “landslide” is almost synonymous with mass wasting, but not quite because some people reserve “landslide” for relatively rapid slope failures, while others do not. Because of that ambiguity, we will avoid the use of “landslide” in this textbook.</p></div>

Erosion, driven by gravity, is the inevitable response to that uplift, and various types of erosion, including mass wasting, have created slopes in the uplifted regions. Slope stability is ultimately determined by two factors: the angle of the slope and the strength of the materials on it.</p> <p>In Figure 15.2 a block of rock situated on a rock slope is being pulled toward Earth’s centre (vertically down) by gravity. We can split the vertical gravitational force into two components relative to the slope: one pushing the block down the slope (the <strong>shear force</strong>), and the other pushing into the slope (the <strong>normal force</strong>). The shear force, which wants to push the block down the slope, has to overcome the strength of the connection between the block and the slope, which may be quite weak if the block has split away from the main body of rock, or may be very strong if the block is still a part of the rock. This is the <strong>shear strength</strong>, and in Figure 15.2a, it greater than the shear force, so the block should not move. In Figure 15.2b the slope is steeper and the shear force is approximately equal to the shear strength. The block may or may not move under these circumstances. In Figure 15.2c, the slope is steeper still, so the shear force is considerably greater than the shear strength, and the block will very likely move.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1267" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Differences-in-the-shear-and-normal-components.png"><img width="400" height="359" class="wp-image-1267" alt="Figure 15.2 Differences in the shear and normal components of the gravitational force on slopes with differing steepness.

In (c) the shear force is substantially greater than the shear strength, so the block is very likely to move. [SE]</div></div> <p>As already noted, slopes are created by uplift followed by erosion. In areas with relatively recent uplift (such as most of British Columbia and the western part of Alberta), slopes tend to be quite steep. This is especially true where glaciation has taken place because glaciers in mountainous terrain create steep-sided valleys. In areas without recent uplift (such as central Canada), slopes are less steep because hundreds of millions of years of erosion (including mass wasting) has made them that way. However, as we’ll see, some mass wasting can happen even on relatively gentle slopes.</p> <p>The strength of the materials on slopes can vary widely. Solid rocks tend to be strong, but there is a very wide range of rock strength. If we consider just the strength of the rocks, and ignore issues like fracturing and layering, then most crystalline rocks — like granite, basalt, or gneiss — are very strong, while some metamorphic rocks — like schist — are moderately strong. Sedimentary rocks have variable strength. Dolostone and some limestone are strong, most sandstone and conglomerate are moderately strong, and some sandstone and all mudstones are quite weak.</p> <p>Fractures, metamorphic foliation, or bedding can significantly reduce the strength of a body of rock, and in the context of mass wasting, this is most critical if the planes of weakness are parallel to the slope and least critical if they are perpendicular to the slope. This is illustrated in Figure 15.3. At locations A and B the bedding is nearly perpendicular to the slope and the situation is relatively stable. At location D the bedding is nearly parallel to the slope and the situation is quite unstable. At location C the bedding is nearly horizontal and the stability is intermediate between the other two extremes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1268" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1268" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Relative-stability-of-slopes-as-a-function-of-the-orientation-of-weaknesses.png"><img width="400" height="139" class="wp-image-1268" alt="Relative stability of slopes as a function of the orientation of weaknesses (in this case bedding planes) relative to the slope orientations.

[SE]</div></div> <p>Internal variations in the composition and structure of rocks can significantly affect their strength. Schist, for example, may have layers that are rich in sheet silicates (mica or chlorite) and these will tend to be weaker than other layers. Some minerals tend to be more susceptible to weathering than others, and the weathered products are commonly quite weak (e.g., the clay formed from feldspar). The side of Johnson Peak that failed in 1965 (Hope Slide) is made up of chlorite schist (metamorphosed sea-floor basalt) that has feldspar-bearing sills within it (they are evident within the inset area of Figure 15.1). The foliation and the sills are parallel to the steep slope. The schist is relatively weak to begin with, and the feldspar in the sills, which has been altered to clay, makes it even weaker.</p> <p>Unconsolidated sediments are generally weaker than sedimentary rocks because they are not cemented and, in most cases, have not been significantly compressed by overlying materials. This binding property of sediment is sometimes referred to as <em>cohesion</em>. Sand and silt tend to be particularly weak, clay is generally a little stronger, and sand mixed with clay can be stronger still. The deposits that make up the cliffs at Point Grey in Vancouver include sand, silt, and clay overlain by sand. As shown in Figure 15.4 (left) the finer deposits are relatively strong (they maintain a steep slope), while the overlying sand is relatively weak, and has a shallower slope that has recently failed. Glacial till — typically a mixture of clay, silt, sand, gravel, and larger clasts — forms and is compressed beneath tens to thousands of metres of glacial ice so it can be as strong as some sedimentary rock (Figure 15.4, right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1015" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/quadra-sand-2.png"><img width="300" height="139" class="size-medium wp-image-1015" alt="Figure 15.4 Left: Glacial outwash deposits at Point Grey, in Vancouver.

[SE]</div></div> <p>Apart from the type of material on a slope, the amount of water that the material contains is the most important factor controlling its strength. This is especially true for unconsolidated materials, like those shown in Figure 15.4, but it also applies to bodies of rock. Granular sediments, like the sand at Point Grey, have lots of spaces between the grains. Those spaces may be completely dry (filled only with air); or moist (often meaning that some spaces are water filled, some grains have a film of water around them, and small amounts of water are present where grains are touching each other); or completely saturated (Figure 15.5). Unconsolidated sediments tend to be strongest when they are moist because the small amounts of water at the grain boundaries hold the grains together with surface tension. Dry sediments are held together only by the friction between grains, and if they are well sorted or well rounded, or both, that cohesion is weak. Saturated sediments tend to be the weakest of all because the large amount of water actually pushes the grains apart, reducing the mount friction between grains. This is especially true if the water is under pressure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1270" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Depiction-of-dry-moist-and-saturated-sand.png"><img width="400" height="141" class="wp-image-1270" alt="Depiction of dry, moist, and saturated sand [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Depiction-of-dry-moist-and-saturated-sand.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1270">Figure 15.5 Depiction of dry, moist, and saturated sand [SE]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 15.1 Sand and Water</strong></p> <p><img width="400" height="300" class="aligncenter wp-image-1271" alt="Sand and Water" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Sand-and-Water-1024x768.jpg" /></p> <p>If you’ve ever been to the beach, you’ll already know that sand behaves differently when it’s dry than it does when it’s wet, but it’s worth taking a systematic look at the differences in its behaviour. Find about half a cup of clean, dry sand (or get some wet sand and dry it out), and then pour it from your hand onto a piece of paper. You should be able to make a cone-shaped pile that has a slope of around 30°. If you pour more sand on the pile, it will get bigger, but the slope should remain the same. Now add some water to the sand so that it is moist. An easy way to do this is to make it completely wet and then let the water drain away for a minute. You should be able to form this moist sand into a steep pile (with slopes of around 80°). Finally, put the same sand into a cup and fill the cup with water so the sand is just covered. Swirl it around so that the sand remains in suspension, and then quickly tip it out onto a flat surface (best to do this outside). It should spread out over a wide area, forming a pile with a slope of only a few degrees. [SE]</p> </div> </div> <p>Water will also reduce the strength of solid rock, especially if it has fractures, bedding planes, or clay-bearing zones. This effect is even more significant when the water is under pressure, which is why you’ll often see holes drilled into rocks on road cuts to relieve this pressure. One of the hypotheses advanced to explain the 1965 Hope Slide is that the very cold conditions that winter caused small springs in the lower part of the slope to freeze over, preventing water from flowing out. It is possible that water pressure gradually built up within the slope, weakening the rock mass to the extent that the shear strength was no longer greater than the shear force.<strong> </strong></p> <p>Water also has a particular effect on clay-bearing materials. All clay minerals will absorb a little bit of water, and this reduces their strength. The <strong>smectite</strong> clays (such as the <strong>bentonite</strong> used in cat litter) can absorb a lot of water, and that water pushes the sheets apart at a molecular level and makes the mineral swell. Smectite that has expanded in this way has almost no strength; it is extremely slippery.</p> <p>And finally, water can significantly increase the mass of the material on a slope, which increases the gravitational force pushing it down. A body of sediment that has 25% porosity and is saturated with water weighs approximately 13% more than it does when it is completely dry, so the gravitational shear force is also 13% higher. In the situation shown in Figure 15.2b, a 13% increase in the shear force could easily be enough to tip the balance between shear force and shear strength.</p> <h1><strong>Mass-Wasting Triggers</strong></h1> <p>In the previous section, we talked about the shear force and the shear strength of materials on slopes, and about factors that can reduce the shear strength. Shear force is primarily related to slope angle, and this does not change quickly. But shear strength can change quickly for a variety of reasons, and events that lead to a rapid reduction in shear strength are considered to be <strong>triggers</strong> for mass wasting.</p> <p>An increase in water content is the most common mass-wasting trigger. This can result from rapid melting of snow or ice, heavy rain, or some type of event that changes the pattern of water flow on the surface. Rapid melting can be caused by a dramatic increase in temperature (e.g., in spring or early summer) or by a volcanic eruption. Heavy rains are typically related to storms. Changes in water flow patterns can be caused by earthquakes, previous slope failures that dam up streams, or human structures that interfere with runoff (e.g., buildings, roads, or parking lots). An example of this is the deadly 2005 debris flow in North Vancouver (Figure 15.6). The 2005 failure took place in an area that had failed previously, and a report written in 1980 recommended that the municipal authorities and residents take steps to address surface and slope drainage issues. Little was done to improve the situation.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1272" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/debris-flow-in-the-Riverside-Drive-area-of-North-Vancouver-.jpg"><img width="400" height="245" class="wp-image-1272" alt="Figure 15.6 The debris flow in the Riverside Drive area of North Vancouver in January, 2005 happened during a rainy period, but was likely triggered by excess runoff related to the roads at the top of this slope and by landscape features, including a pool, in the area surrounding the house visible here.

This is most common with clean sand deposits (e.g., the upper layer in Figure 15.4 (left)), which lose strength when there is no more water around the grains.</p> <p>Freezing and thawing can also trigger some forms of mass wasting. More specifically, the thawing can release a block of rock that was attached to a slope by a film of ice.</p> <p>One other process that can weaken a body of rock or sediment is shaking. The most obvious source of shaking is an earthquake, but shaking from highway traffic, construction, or mining will also do the job. Several deadly mass-wasting events (including snow avalanches) were trigged by the M7.8 earthquake in Nepal in April 2015.</p> </div></div>

If you’ve ever hiked along a steep mountain trail on a cool morning, you might have heard the occasional fall of rock fragments onto a <strong>talus slope</strong>. This happens because the water between cracks freezes and expands overnight, and then when that same water thaws in the morning sun, the fragments that had been pushed beyond their limit by the ice fall to the slope below (Figure 15.7).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1273" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/contribution-of-freeze-thaw-to-rock-fall.png"><img width="400" height="211" class="wp-image-1273" alt="Figure 15.7 The contribution of freeze-thaw to rock fall [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/contribution-of-freeze-thaw-to-rock-fall.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1273">Figure 15.7 The contribution of freeze-thaw to rock fall [SE]</div></div> <p>A typical talus slope, near Keremeos in southern B.C., is shown in Figure 15.8.

In most cases, the movement is parallel to a fracture, bedding, or metamorphic foliation plane, and it can range from very slow to moderately fast. The word <strong>sackung</strong> describes the very slow motion of a block of rock (mm/y to cm/y) on a slope. A good example is the Downie Slide north of Revelstoke, B.C., which is shown in Figure 15.9. In this case, a massive body of rock is very slowly sliding down a steep slope along a plane of weakness that is approximately parallel to the slope. The Downie Slide, which was recognized prior to the construction of the Revelstoke Dam, was moving very slowly at the time (a few cm/year). Geological engineers were concerned that the presence of water in the reservoir (visible in Figure 15.9) could further weaken the plane of failure, leading to an acceleration of the motion. The result would have been a catastrophic failure into the reservoir that would have sent a wall of water over the dam and into the community of Revelstoke. During the construction of the dam, they tunnelled into the rock at the base of the slide and drilled hundreds of drainage holes upward into the plane of failure. This allowed water to drain out so that the pressure was reduced, which reduced the rate of movement of the sliding block. BC Hydro monitors this site continuously; the slide block is currently moving more slowly than it was prior to the construction of the dam.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1275" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-Downie-Slide.png"><img width="400" height="192" class="wp-image-1275" alt="Figure 15.9 The Downie Slide, a sackung, on the shore of the Revelstoke Reservoir (above the Revelstoke Dam).

The block slammed into the highway and adjacent railway and broke into many pieces. The highway was closed for several days, and the slope was subsequently stabilized with rock bolts and drainage holes. As shown in Figure 15.10, the rock is fractured parallel to the slope, and this almost certainly contributed to the failure. However, it is not actually known what triggered this event as the weather was dry and warm during the preceding weeks, and there was no significant earthquake in the region.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1276" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Site-of-the-2008-rock-slide-at-Porteau-Cove.jpg"><img width="400" height="289" class="wp-image-1276" alt="Figure 15.10 Site of the 2008 rock slide at Porteau Cove.

The 1965 Hope Slide (Figure 15.1) was a rock avalanche, as was the famous 1903 Frank Slide in southwestern Alberta. The 2010 slide at Mt. Meager (west of Lillooet) was also a rock avalanche, and rivals the Hope Slide as the largest slope failure in Canada during historical times (Figure 15.11).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1277" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/2010-Mt.-Meager-rock-avalanche-.png"><img width="400" height="370" class="wp-image-1277" alt="Figure 15.11 The 2010 Mt.

Creep can be facilitated by freezing and thawing because, as shown in Figure 15.12, particles are lifted perpendicular to the surface by the growth of ice crystals within the soil, and then let down vertically by gravity when the ice melts. The same effect can be produced by frequent wetting and drying of the soil. In cold environments, <strong>solifluction</strong> is a more intense form of freeze-thaw-triggered creep.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1278" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/depiction-of-the-contribution-of-freeze-thaw.png"><img width="400" height="251" class="wp-image-1278" alt="Figure 15.12 A depiction of the contribution of freeze-thaw to creep.

Slumps involve movement along one or more curved failure surfaces, with downward motion near the top and outward motion toward the bottom (Figure 15.14). They are typically caused by an excess of water within these materials on a steep slope.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1280" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/motion-of-unconsolidated-sediments-in-an-area-of-slumping-.png"><img width="400" height="178" class="wp-image-1280" alt="Figure 15.14 A depiction of the motion of unconsolidated sediments in an area of slumping [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/motion-of-unconsolidated-sediments-in-an-area-of-slumping-1024x456.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1280">Figure 15.14 A depiction of the motion of unconsolidated sediments in an area of slumping [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>An example of a slump in the Lethbridge area of Alberta is shown in Figure 15.15.

This can happen during rapid spring snowmelt or heavy rains, and is also relatively common during volcanic eruptions because of the rapid melting of snow and ice. (A mudflow or debris flow on a volcano or during a volcanic eruption is a <em>lahar</em>.) If the material involved is primarily sand-sized or smaller, it is known as a mudflow, such as the one shown in Figure 15.16.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1014" style="width: 243px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/lethbridge-2.png"><img width="243" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1014" alt="Figure 15.16 A slump (left) and an associated mudflow (centre) at the same location as Figure 15.15, near Lethbridge, Alberta.

Because it takes more gravitational energy to move larger particles, a debris flow typically forms in an area with steeper slopes and more water than does a mudflow. In many cases, a debris flow takes place within a steep stream channel, and is triggered by the collapse of bank material into the stream. This creates a temporary dam, and then a major flow of water and debris when the dam breaks. This is the situation that led to the fatal debris flow at Johnsons Landing, B.C., in 2012. A typical west-coast debris flow is shown in Figure 15.17. This event took place in November 2006 in response to very heavy rainfall. There was enough energy to move large boulders and to knock over large trees.<strong> </strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1012" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1012" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/buttle.png"><img width="300" height="175" class="size-medium wp-image-1012" alt="Figure 15.17 The lower part of debris flow within a steep stream channel near Buttle Lake, B.C., in November 2006.

Where we can neither delay nor mitigate mass wasting, we should consider moving out of the way.</p> <h1><strong>Preventing and Delaying Mass Wasting</strong></h1> <p>It is comforting to think that we can prevent some effects of mass wasting by mechanical means, such as the rock bolts in the road cut at Porteau Cove (Figure 15.10), or the drill holes used to drain water out of a slope, as was done at the Downie Slide (Figure 15.9), or the building of physical barriers, such as retaining walls. What we have to remember is that the works of humans are limited compared to the works of nature. The rock bolts in the road cut at Porteau Cove will slowly start to corrode after a few years, and within a few decades, many of them will begin to lose their strength. Unless they are replaced, they will no longer support that slope. Likewise, drainage holes at the Downie Slide will eventually become plugged with sediment and chemical precipitates, and unless they are periodically unplugged, their effectiveness will decrease. Eventually, unless new holes are drilled, the drainage will be so compromised that the slide will start to move again. This is why careful slope monitoring by geological and geotechnical engineers is important at these sites. The point here is that our efforts to “prevent” mass wasting are only as good as our resolve to maintain those preventive measures.</p> <p>Delaying mass wasting is a worthy endeavour, of course, because during the time that the measures are still effective they can save lives and reduce damage to property and infrastructure. The other side of the coin is that we must be careful to avoid activities that could make mass wasting more likely. One of the most common anthropogenic causes of mass wasting is road construction, and this applies both to remote gravel roads built for forestry and mining and large urban and regional highways. Road construction is a potential problem for two reasons. First, creating a flat road surface on a slope inevitably involves creating a cut bank that is steeper than the original slope. This might also involve creating a filled bank that is both steeper and weaker than the original slope (Figure 15.18). Second, roadways typically cut across natural drainage features, and unless great care is taken to reroute the runoff water and prevent it from forming concentrated flows, oversaturating fill of materials can result. A specific example of the contribution of construction-related impeded drainage to slope instability was shown earlier in Figure 15.6.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1288" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/road-constructed-by-cutting-into-a-steep-slope.png"><img width="350" height="235" class="wp-image-1288" alt="Figure 15.18 An example of a road constructed by cutting into a steep slope and the use of the cut material as fill.

If possible, situations like that at Porteau Cove (Figure 15.10) should be avoided — by building somewhere else — rather than trying to stitch the slope back together with rock bolts.</p> <p>It is widely believed that construction of buildings on the tops of steep slopes can contribute to the instability of the slope. This is probably true, but not because of the weight of the building. As you’ll see by completing Exercise 15.3, a typical house isn’t usually heavier than the fill that was removed from the hole in the ground made to build it. A more likely contributor to instability of the slope around a building is the effect that it and the changes made to the surrounding area have on drainage.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 15.3 How Much Does a House Weigh and Can It Contribute to a Slope Failure?</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/How-Much-Does-a-House-Weigh-and-Can-It-Contribute-to-a-Slope-Failure.png"><img width="363" height="191" class="wp-image-1289 aligncenter" alt="How Much Does a House Weigh and Can It Contribute to a Slope Failure" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/How-Much-Does-a-House-Weigh-and-Can-It-Contribute-to-a-Slope-Failure.png" /></a></p> <p>It is commonly believed that building a house (or some other building) at the top of a slope will add a lot of extra weight to the slope, which could contribute to slope failure. But what does a house actually weigh? A typical 150 m<sup>2</sup> (approximately 1,600 ft<sup>2</sup>) wood-frame house with a basement and a concrete foundation weighs about 145 t (metric tonnes). But most houses are built on foundations that are excavated into the ground. This involves digging a hole and taking some material away, so we need to subtract what that excavated material weighs. Assuming our 150 m<sup>2</sup> house required an excavation that was 15 m by 11 m by 1 m deep, that’s 165 m<sup>3</sup> of “dirt,” which typically has a density of about 1.6 t per m<sup>3</sup>.</p> <p>Calculate the weight of the soil that was removed and compare that with the weight of the house and its foundation.</p> <p>If you’re thinking that building a bigger building is going to add more weight, consider that bigger buildings need bigger and deeper excavations, and in many cases the excavations will be into solid rock, which is much heavier than surficial materials.</p> <p>You may wish to consider how a building might change the drainage on a slope. There are a number ways. Water can be collected by roofs, go into downspouts, and form concentrated flows that are directed onto or into the slope. Likewise drainage from nearby access roads, lawn irrigation, leaking pools, and septic systems can all alter the surface and groundwater flow in a slope.</p> </div> </div> <h1><strong>Monitoring Mass Wasting </strong></h1> <p>In some areas, it is necessary to establish warning systems so that we know if conditions have changed at a known slide area, or if a rapid failure, such as a debris flow, is actually on its way downslope. The Downie Slide above the Revelstoke Resevoir is monitored 24/7 with a range of devices, such as inclinometers (slope-change detectors), bore-hole motion sensors, and GPS survey instruments. A simple mechanical device for monitoring the nearby Checkerboard Slide (which is also above the Revelstoke Reservoir) is shown in Figure 15.19. Both of these are very slow-moving rock slides, but it’s very important to be able to detect changes in their rates of motion because at both of these locations a rapid failure would result in large bodies of rock plunging into the reservoir and sending a wall of water over the Revelstoke Dam, potentially destroying the nearby town of Revelstoke.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1290" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/motion-monitoring-device-at-the-Checkerboard-Slide-near-Revelstoke.jpg"><img width="350" height="400" class="wp-image-1290" alt="Figure 15.19 Part of a motion-monitoring device at the Checkerboard Slide near Revelstoke, B.C.

Rainier, a glacier-covered volcano in Washington State, has the potential to produce massive mudflows or debris flows (lahars) with or without a volcanic eruption. Over 100,000 people in the Tacoma, Puyallup, and Sumner areas are in harm’s way because they currently reside on deposits from past lahars (Figure 15.20). In 1998, a network of acoustic monitors was established around Mt. Rainier. The monitors are embedded in the ground adjacent to expected lahar paths. They are intended to provide warnings to emergency officials, and when a lahar is detected, the residents of the area will have anywhere from 40 minutes to three hours to get to safe ground.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1291" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Mount-Rainier.jpg"><img width="400" height="264" class="wp-image-1291" alt="Figure 15.20 Mount Rainier, Washington, from Tacoma.

For example, many highways in B.C. and western Alberta have avalanche shelters like that shown in Figure 15.21. In some parts of the world, similar features have been built to protect infrastructure from other types of mass wasting.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1016" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1016" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/snow-shed-2.png"><img width="300" height="113" class="size-medium wp-image-1016" alt="Figure 15.21 A snow avalanche shelter on the Coquihalla Highway.

The results have been deadly and expensive many times in the past. It would be very expensive to develop a new route in this region, so provincial authorities have taken steps to protect residents and traffic on the highway and the railway. Debris-flow defensive structures have been constructed in several drainage basins, as shown in Figure 15.22. One strategy is to allow the debris to flow quickly through to the ocean along a smooth channel. Another is to capture the debris within a constructed basin that allows the excess water to continue through, but catches the debris materials.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1011" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1011" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/alberta-charles-2.png"><img width="300" height="91" class="size-medium wp-image-1011" alt="Figure 15.22 Two strategies for mitigating debris flows on the Sea-to-Sky Highway.

There is a famous example of this in B.C. at a site known as Garibaldi, 25 km south of Whistler. In the early 1980s the village of Garibaldi had a population of about 100, with construction underway on some new homes, and plans for many more. In the months that followed the deadly 1980 eruption of Mt. St. Helens in Washington State, the B.C. Ministry of Transportation commissioned a geological study that revealed that a steep cliff known as The Barrier (Figure 15.23) had collapsed in 1855, leading to a large rock avalanche, and that it was likely to collapse again unpredictably, putting the village of Garibaldi at extreme risk. In an ensuing court case, it was ruled that the Garibaldi site was not a safe place for people to live. Those who already had homes there were compensated, and everyone else was ordered to leave.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1294" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-Barrier.jpg"><img width="400" height="255" class="wp-image-1294" alt="Figure 15.23 The Barrier, south of Whistler, B.C., was the site of a huge rock avalanche in 1855, which extended from the cliff visible here 4 km down the valley and across the current location of the Sea-to-Sky Highway and the Cheakamus River.

Slopes are a product of tectonic uplift, and their strength is determined by the type of material on the slope and its water content. Rock strength varies widely and is determined by internal planes of weakness and their orientation with respect to the slope. In general, the more water, the greater the likelihood of failure. This is especially true for unconsolidated sediments, where excess water pushes the grains apart. Addition of water is the most common trigger of mass wasting, and can come from storms, rapid melting, or flooding.</td> </tr> <tr><th>15.2</th> <th>Classification of Mass Wasting</th> <td>The key criterion for classifying mass wasting is the nature of the movement that takes place. This may be a precipitous fall through the air, sliding as a solid mass along either a plane or a curved surface, or internal flow as a viscous fluid. The type of material that moves is also important — specifically whether it is solid rock or unconsolidated sediments. The important types of mass wasting are creep, slump, translational slide, rotational slide, fall, and debris flow or mudflow.</td> </tr> <tr><th>15.3</th> <th>Preventing, Delaying, and Mitigating Mass Wasting</th> <td>We cannot prevent mass wasting, but we can delay it through efforts to strengthen the materials on slopes. Strategies include adding mechanical devices such as rock bolts or ensuring that water can drain away. Such measures are never permanent, but may be effective for decades or even centuries. We can also avoid practices that make matters worse, such as cutting into steep slopes or impeding proper drainage. In some situations, the best approach is to mitigate the risks associated with mass wasting by constructing shelters or diversionary channels. And in other cases, where slope failure is inevitable, we should simply avoid building anything there.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/gravitational-force-on-the-unconsolidated-sediment.png"><img class="wp-image-1295 alignright" alt="gravitational force on the unconsolidated sediment" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/gravitational-force-on-the-unconsolidated-sediment.png" height="203" width="250" /></a>1.

About 10% of Earth’s land surface is currently covered with glacial ice, and although the vast majority of that is in Antarctica and Greenland, there are many glaciers in Canada, especially in the mountainous parts of B.C., Alberta, and Yukon and in the far north (Figure 16.1).

In the current warming climate, glaciers are melting rapidly worldwide, and although some of the larger glacial masses will last for centuries more, many smaller glaciers, including many in western Canada, will be gone within decades, and in some cases, within years. That is more than just a troubling thought for western Canadians because we rely on glacial ice for our water supplies — if not for water to drink, then for water to grow food.

[SE]</div></div> <p>The oldest known glacial period is the Huronian. Based on evidence of glacial deposits from the area around Lake Huron in Ontario and elsewhere, it is evident that the Huronian Glaciation lasted from approximately 2,400 to 2,100 Ma. Because rocks of that age are rare, we don’t know much about the intensity or global extent of this glaciation.</p> <p>Late in the Proterozoic, for reasons that are not fully understood, the climate cooled dramatically and Earth was seized by what appears to be its most intense glaciation. The glaciations of the Cryogenian Period (<em>cryo</em> is Latin for icy cold) are also known as the “Snowball Earth” glaciations, because it is hypothesized that the entire planet was frozen — even in equatorial regions — with ice on the oceans up to 1 km thick. A visitor to our planet at that time might not have held out much hope for its inhabitability, although life still survived in the oceans. There were two main glacial periods within the Cryogenian, each lasting for about 20 million years: the Sturtian at around 700 Ma and the Marinoan at 650 Ma. There is also evidence of some shorter glaciations both before and after these. The end of the Cryogenian glaciations coincides with the evolution of relatively large and complex life forms on Earth. This started during the Ediacaran Period, and then continued with the so-called explosion of life forms in the Cambrian. Some geologists think that the changing environmental conditions of the Cryogenian are what actually triggered the evolution of large and complex life.</p> <p>There have been three major glaciations during the Phanerozoic (the past 540 million years), including the Andean/Saharan (recorded in rocks of South America and Africa), the Karoo (named for rocks in southern Africa), and the Cenozoic glaciations. The Karoo was the longest of the Phanerozoic glaciations, persisting for much of the time that the supercontinent Gondwana was situated over the South Pole (~360 to 260 Ma). It covered large parts of Africa, South America, Australia, and Antarctica (see Figure 10.4). As you might recall from Chapter 10, this widespread glaciation, across continents that are now far apart, was an important component of Alfred Wegener’s evidence for continental drift. Unlike the Cryogenian glaciations, the Andean/Saharan, Karoo, and Cenozoic glaciations only affected parts of Earth. During Karoo times, for example, what is now North America was near the equator and remained unglaciated.</p> <p>Earth was warm and essentially unglaciated throughout the Mesozoic. Although there may have been some alpine glaciation at this time, there is no longer any record of it. The dinosaurs, which dominated terrestrial habitats during the Mesozoic, did not have to endure icy conditions.</p> <p>A warm climate persisted into the Cenozoic; in fact there is evidence that the Paleocene (~50 to 60 Ma) was the warmest part of the Phanerozoic since the Cambrian (Figure 16.3). A number of tectonic events during the Cenozoic contributed to persistent and significant planetary cooling since 50 Ma. For example, the collision of India with Asia and the formation of the Himalayan range and the Tibetan Plateau resulted in a dramatic increase in the rate of weathering and erosion. Higher than normal rates of weathering of rocks with silicate minerals, especially feldspar, consumes carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and therefore reduces the greenhouse effect, resulting in long-term cooling.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1027" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/cenozoic-t-2.png"><img width="300" height="131" class="size-medium wp-image-1027" alt="Figure 16.3 The global temperature trend over the past 65 Ma (the Cenozoic).

At around 15 Ma, subduction-related volcanism between central and South America created the connection between North and South America, preventing water from flowing between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This further restricted the transfer of heat from the tropics to the poles, leading to a rejuvenation of the Antarctic glaciation. The expansion of that ice sheet increased Earth’s reflectivity enough to promote a positive feedback loop of further cooling: more reflective glacial ice, more cooling, more ice, etc. By the Pliocene (~5 Ma) ice sheets had started to grow in North America and northern Europe (Figure 16.5). The most intense part of the current glaciation — and the coldest climate — has been during the past million years (the last one-third of the Pleistocene), but if we count Antarctic glaciation, it really extends from the Oligocene to the Holocene, and will likely continue into the future.</p> <p>The Pleistocene has been characterized by significant temperature variations (through a range of almost 10°C) on time scales of 40,000 to 100,000 years, and corresponding expansion and contraction of ice sheets. These variations are attributed to subtle changes in Earth’s orbital parameters (Milankovitch cycles), which are explained in more detail in Chapter 21. Over the past million years, the glaciation cycles have been approximately 100,000 years; this variability is visible in Figure 16.5.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_661" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-661" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Foram-oxygen-isotope-record.png"><img width="600" height="278" class="wp-image-661" alt="Figure 16.5 Foram oxygen isotope record for the past 5 million years based on O isotope data from sea-floor sediments.

Instead, ice flows from the region where it is thickest toward the edges where it is thinner, as shown in Figure 16.9. This means that in the central thickest parts, the ice flows almost vertically down toward the base, while in the peripheral parts, it flows out toward the margins. In continental glaciers like Antarctica and Greenland, the thickest parts (4,000 m and 3,000 m respectively) are the areas where the rate of snowfall and therefore of ice accumulation are highest.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1050" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1050" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/antarctic-flow-2.png"><img width="300" height="85" class="size-medium wp-image-1050" alt="Figure 16.9 Schematic ice-flow diagram for the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

The snow layer from each year is covered and compacted by subsequent snow, and it is gradually compressed and turned into <strong>firn</strong> within which the snowflakes lose their delicate shapes and become granules. With more compression, the granules are pushed together and air is squeezed out. Eventually the granules are “welded” together to create glacial ice (Figure 16.11).

Below that line, in the zone of ablation, bare ice is exposed because last winter’s snow has all melted; above that line, the ice is still mostly covered with snow from last winter. The position of the equilibrium line changes from year to year as a function of the balance between snow accumulation in the winter and snowmelt during the summer. More winter snow and less summer melting obviously favours the advance of the equilibrium line (and of the glacier’s leading edge), but of these two variables, it is the summer melt that matters most to a glacier’s budget.

This generates a stress on the ice, which is proportional to the slope and to the depth below the surface. As shown in Figure 16.12, the stresses are quite small near the ice surface but much larger at depth, and also greater in areas where the ice surface is relatively steep. Ice will deform, meaning that it will behave in a plastic manner, at stress levels of around 100 kilopascals; therefore, in the upper 50 m to 100 m of the ice (above the dashed red line), flow is not plastic (the ice is rigid), while below that depth, ice is plastic and will flow.</p> <p>When the lower ice of a glacier flows, it moves the upper ice along with it, so although it might seem from the stress patterns (red numbers and red arrows) shown in Figure 16.13 that the lower part moves the most, in fact while the lower part deforms (and flows) and the upper part doesn’t deform at all, the upper part moves the fastest because it is pushed along by the lower ice.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1035" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/ice-stress-2.png"><img width="300" height="130" class="size-medium wp-image-1035" alt="Figure 16.13 Stress within a valley glacier (red numbers) as determined from the slope of the ice surface and the depth within the ice.

However, the upper rigid ice cannot flow in this way, and because it is being carried along by the lower ice, it tends to crack where the lower ice has to flex. This leads to the development of <strong>crevasses</strong> in areas where the rate of flow of the plastic ice is changing. In the area shown in Figure 16.14, for example, the glacier is speeding up over the steep terrain, and the rigid surface ice has to crack to account for the change in velocity.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-671" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Overlord-Glacier.jpg"><img width="400" height="303" class="wp-image-671" alt="Figure 16.14 Crevasses on Overlord Glacier in the Whistler area, B.C.

If it is warm, there will likely be a film of water between the ice and the material underneath, and the ice will be able to slide over that surface. This is known as <strong>basal sliding</strong> (Figure 16.15, left). If the base is cold, the ice will be frozen to the material underneath and it will be stuck — unable to slide along its base. In this case, all of the movement of the ice will be by internal flow.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1030" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/flow-rates-2.png"><img width="300" height="152" class="size-medium wp-image-1030" alt="Figure 16.15 Differences in glacial ice motion with basal sliding (left) and without basal sliding (right).

Ice is a good insulator. The slow transfer of heat from Earth’s interior provides enough heat to warm up the base if the ice is thick, but not enough if it is thin and that heat can escape. It is typical for the leading edge of an alpine glacier to be relatively thin (see Figure 16.13), so it is common for that part to be frozen to its base while the rest of the glacier is still sliding. This is illustrated in Figure 16.16 for the Athabasca Glacier. Because the leading edge of the glacier is stuck to its frozen base, while the rest continues to slide, the ice coming from behind has pushed (or thrust) itself over top of the part that is stuck fast.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1040" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1040" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/thrusting-2.png"><img width="300" height="139" class="size-medium wp-image-1040" alt="Figure 16.16 Thrust faults at the leading edge of the Athabasca Glacier, Alberta.

The ice itself is not particularly effective at erosion because it is relatively soft (Mohs hardness 1.5 at 0°C); instead, it is the rock fragments embedded in the ice and pushed down onto the underlying surfaces that do most of the erosion. A useful analogy would be to compare the effect of a piece of paper being rubbed against a wooden surface, as opposed to a piece of sandpaper that has embedded angular fragments of garnet.</p> <p>The results of glacial erosion are different in areas with continental glaciation versus alpine glaciation. Continental glaciation tends to produce relatively flat bedrock surfaces, especially where the rock beneath is uniform in strength. In areas where there are differences in the strength of rocks, a glacier obviously tends to erode the softer and weaker rock more effectively than the harder and stronger rock. Much of central and eastern Canada, which was completely covered by the huge Laurentide Ice Sheet at various times during the Pleistocene, has been eroded to a relatively flat surface. In many cases the existing relief is due the presence of glacial deposits — such as drumlins, eskers, and moraines (all discussed below) — rather than to differential erosion (Figure 16.19).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-677" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Drumlins-e1438086592891.png"><img width="400" height="294" class="wp-image-677" alt="Figure 16.19 Drumlins — streamlined hills formed beneath a glacier, here made up of sediment — in the Amundsun Gulf region of Nunavut.

In general, glaciers are much wider than rivers of similar length, and since they tend to erode more at their bases than their sides, they produce wide valleys with relatively flat bottoms and steep sides — known as <strong>U-shaped valleys</strong> (Figure 16.20). Howe Sound, north of Vancouver, was occupied by a large glacier that originated in the Squamish, Whistler, and Pemberton areas, and then joined the much larger glacier in the Strait of Georgia.

This area was much more intensely glaciated during the past glacial maximum. At that time, the large U-shaped valley in the lower right was occupied by glacial ice, and all of the other glaciers shown here were longer and much thicker than they are now. But even at the peak of the Pleistocene Glaciation, some of the higher peaks and ridges would have been exposed and not directly affected by glacial erosion. A peak that extends above the surrounding glacier is called a <strong>nunatuk</strong>. In these areas, and in the areas above the glaciers today, most of the erosion is related to freeze-thaw effects.</p> <p>Some of the important features visible in Figure 16.22 are <strong>arêtes</strong>: sharp ridges between U-shaped glacial valleys; <strong>cols</strong>: low points along arêtes that constitute passes between glacial valleys; <strong>horns</strong>: steep peaks that have been glacially and freeze-thaw eroded on three or more sides; <strong>cirques</strong>: bowl-shaped basins that form at the head of a glacial valley; <strong>hanging valleys</strong>: U-shaped valleys of tributary glaciers that hang above the main valley because the larger main-valley glacier eroded more deeply into the terrain; and <strong>truncated spurs</strong> (a.k.a. “spurs”): the ends of arêtes that have been eroded into steep triangle-shaped cliffs by the glacier in the corresponding main valley.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1022" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1022" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/aletsch-2.png"><img width="300" height="194" class="size-medium wp-image-1022" alt="Figure 16.22 A view from the International Space Station of the Swiss Alps in the area of the Aletsch Glacier.

A lake that is confined to a glacial cirque is known as a <strong>tarn</strong> (Figure 16.26). Tarns are common in areas of alpine glaciation because the ice that forms a cirque typically carves out a depression in bedrock that then fills with water. In some cases, a series of such basins will form, and the resulting lakes are called <strong>rock basin lakes</strong> or <strong>paternoster lakes</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_685" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-685" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Lower-Thornton-Lake.jpg"><img width="400" height="189" class="wp-image-685" alt="Figure 16.26 Lower Thornton Lake, a tarn, in the Northern Cascades National Park, Washington.

Basins are formed along the edges of continental glaciers (except for those that cover entire continents like Antarctica and Greenland), and these basins fill with glacial meltwater. Many such lakes, some of them huge, existed at various times along the southern edge of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. One example is Glacial Lake Missoula, which formed within Idaho and Montana, just south of the B.C. border with the United States. During the latter part of the last glaciation (30 ka to 15 ka), the ice holding back Lake Missoula retreated enough to allow some of the lake water to start flowing out, which escalated into a massive and rapid outflow (over days to weeks) during which much of the volume of the lake drained along the valley of the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean. It is estimated that this type of flooding happened at least 25 times over that period, and in many cases, the rate of outflow was equivalent to the discharge of all of Earth’s current rivers combined. The record of these massive floods is preserved in the Channelled Scablands of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon (Figure 16.28).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_687" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-687" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/07/Potholes-Coulee.jpg"><img width="400" height="136" class="wp-image-687" alt="Figure 16.28 Potholes Coulee near Wenatchee, Washington, one of many basins that received Lake Missoula floodwaters during the late Pleistocene.

The Bering Glacier is the largest in North America, and although most of it is in Alaska, it flows from an icefield that extends into southwestern Yukon. The surface of the ice is partially, or in some cases completely, covered with rocky debris that has fallen from surrounding steep rock faces. There are muddy rivers issuing from the glacier in several locations, depositing sediment on land, into Vitus Lake, and directly into the ocean. There are dirty icebergs shedding their sediment into the lake.

The main types of sediment in a glacial environment are described below.</p> <p><strong>Supraglacial</strong> (on top of the ice) and <strong>englacial</strong> (within the ice) sediments that slide off the melting front of a stationary glacier can form a ridge of unsorted sediments called an <strong>end moraine</strong>.

It has a wide range of grain sizes, including a relatively high proportion of silt and clay. The larger clasts (pebbles to boulders in size) tend to become partly rounded by abrasion. When a glacier eventually melts, the lodgement till is exposed as a sheet of well-compacted sediment ranging from several centimetres to many metres in thickness. Lodgement till is normally unbedded. An example is shown in Figure 16.31a.</p> <p>Supraglacial sediments are primarily derived from freeze-thaw eroded material that has fallen onto the ice from rocky slopes above. These sediments form <strong>lateral moraines</strong> (Figure 16.1) and, where two glaciers meet, <strong>medial moraines</strong>. (Medial moraines are visible on the Aletsch Glacier in Figure 16.22.) Most of this material is deposited on the ground when the ice melts, and is therefore called <strong>ablation till</strong>, a mixture of fine and coarse angular rock fragments, with much less sand, silt, and clay than lodgement till. An example is shown in Figure 16.31b. When supraglacial sediments become incorporated into the body of the glacier, they are known as englacial sediments (Figure 16.30).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1041" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1041" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/till-2.png"><img width="300" height="144" class="size-medium wp-image-1041" alt="Figure 16.31 Examples of glacial till: a: lodgement till from the front of the Athabasca Glacier, Alberta; b: ablation till at the Horstman Glacier, Blackcomb Mountain, B.C.

Depending on its velocity, this water is able to move sediments of various sizes and most of that material is washed out of the lower end of the glacier and deposited as outwash sediments. These sediments accumulate in a wide range of environments in the <strong>proglacial</strong> region (the area in front of a glacier), most in fluvial environments, but some in lakes and the ocean. <strong>Glaciofluvial sediments</strong> are similar to sediments deposited in normal fluvial environments, and are dominated by silt, sand, and gravel. The grains tend to be moderately well rounded, and the sediments have similar sedimentary structures (e.g., bedding, cross-bedding, clast imbrication) to those formed by non-glacial streams (Figure 16.32a and 16.32b).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1031" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1031" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/gf-2.png"><img width="300" height="145" class="size-medium wp-image-1031" alt="Figure 16.32 Examples of glaciofluvial sediments: a: glaciofluvial sand of the Quadra Sand Formation at Comox, B.C.; b: glaciofluvial gravel and sand, Nanaimo, B.C." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/gf-2-300x145.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1031">Figure 16.32 Examples of glaciofluvial sediments: a: glaciofluvial sand of the Quadra Sand Formation at Comox, B.C.; b: glaciofluvial gravel and sand, Nanaimo, B.C.</div></div> <p>A large proglacial plain of sediment is called a <strong>sandur</strong> (a.k.a. an <strong>outwash plain</strong>)<strong>, </strong>and within that area, glaciofluvial deposits can be tens of metres thick.

The late Proterozoic “Snowball Earth” glaciations were thought to be sufficiently intense to affect the entire planet. The current glacial period is known as the Pleistocene Glaciation, and while it was much more intense 20,000 years ago than it is now, we are still in the middle of it. The periodicity of the Pleistocene glaciations is related to subtle changes in Earth’s orbital characteristics, which are exaggerated by a variety of positive feedback processes.</td> </tr> <tr><th>16.2</th> <th>How Glaciers Work</th> <td>The two main types of glaciers are continental glaciers, which cover large parts of continents, and alpine glaciers, which occupy mountainous regions. Ice accumulates at higher elevations — above the equilibrium line — where the snow that falls in winter does not all melt in summer. In continental glaciers, ice flows outward from where it is thickest. In alpine glaciers, ice flows downslope. At depth in the glacier ice, flow is by internal deformation, but glaciers that have liquid water at their base can also flow by basal sliding. Crevasses form in the rigid surface ice in places where the lower plastic ice is changing shape.</td> </tr> <tr><th>16.3</th> <th>Glacial Erosion</th> <td>Glaciers are important agents of erosion. Continental glaciers tend to erode the land surface into flat plains, while alpine glaciers create a wide variety of different forms. The key feature of alpine glacial erosion is the U-shaped valley. Arêtes are sharp ridges that form between two valleys, and horns form where a mountain is glacially eroded on at least three sides. Because tributary glaciers do not erode as deeply as main-valley glaciers, hanging valleys exist where the two meet. On a smaller scale, both types of glaciers form drumlins, roches moutonées, and glacial grooves or striae.</td> </tr> <tr><th>16.4</th> <th>Glacial Deposition</th> <td>Glacial deposits are quite varied, as materials are transported and deposited in a variety of different ways in a glacial environment. Sediments that are moved and deposited directly by ice are known as till. Glaciofluvial sediments are deposited by glacial streams, either forming eskers or large proglacial plains known as sandurs. Glaciolacustrine and glaciomarine sediments originate within glaciers and are deposited in lakes and the ocean respectively.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

They love panoramic ocean views, they love sandy beaches on crystal-clear lakes, they love to swim and surf and go out in boats, and they love watching giant waves crash onto rocky shores. While an understanding of coastal processes isn’t necessary for our enjoyment of coastal regions, it can make our time there much more interesting. But an understanding of coastal processes is critical to people who live near a coast, or those who like to spend a lot of time there, because in order to be safe and avoid damage to infrastructure, we need to know how coastal processes work. We also need to understand the processes in order to avoid some of the possible consequences of changes that we might like to make in coastal areas.</p></div>

In a situation where the fetch is short (say 19 km on a lake) and the wind is only moderate (19 km/h), the waves will develop fully within 2 hours, but they will remain quite small (average amplitude about 27 cm, wavelength 8.5 m). On a large body of water (the ocean or a very large lake) with a fetch of 139 km and winds of 37 km/h, the waves will develop fully in 10 hours; the average amplitude will be around 1.5 m and average wavelength around 34 m. In the open ocean, with strong winds (92 km/h) that blow for at least 69 hours, the waves will average nearly 15 m high and their wavelengths will be over 200 m. Small waves (amplitudes under a metre) tend to have relatively shallow slopes (amplitude is 3% to 4% of wavelength), while larger waves (amplitudes over 10 m) have much steeper slopes (amplitude is 6% to 7% of wavelength). In other words, not only are large waves bigger than small ones, they are also generally more than twice as steep, and therefore many times more impressive. It is important to recognize, however, that amplitudes decrease with distance from the area where the waves were generated. Waves on our coast that are generated by a storm near Japan will have similar wavelengths but lower amplitudes than those generated by a comparable storm offshore from Vancouver Island.</p> <table style="height: 235px; width: 476px;"><caption>Table 17.1 The parameters of wind waves in situations where the wind blows in roughly the same direction for long enough for the waves to develop fully.

Very large waves move about five times faster (over 50 km/h), but because their wavelengths are so much longer, they arrive less frequently — about once every 14 seconds.</p> <p>As a wave moves across the surface of the water, the water itself mostly just moves up and down and only moves a small amount in the direction of wave motion. As this happens, a point on the water surface describes a circle with a diameter that is equal to the wave amplitude (Figure 17.3). This motion is also transmitted to the water underneath, and the water is disturbed by a wave to a depth of approximately one-half of the wavelength. Wave motion is illustrated quite clearly on the Wikipedia “Wind wave” site at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave#/media/File:Deep_water_wave.gif">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_wave#/media/File:Deep_water_wave.gif</a>.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The one-half wavelength depth of disturbance of the water beneath a wave is known as the <strong>wave base</strong>. Since ocean waves rarely have wavelengths greater than 200 m, and the open ocean is several thousand metres deep, the wave base does not normally interact with the bottom of the ocean. However, as waves approach the much shallower water near the shore, they start to “feel” the bottom, and they are affected by that interaction (Figure 17.4). The wave “orbits” are both flattened and slowed by dragging, and the implications are that the wave amplitude (height) increases and the wavelength decreases (the waves become much steeper). The ultimate result of this is that the waves lean forward, and eventually break (Figure 17.5).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1048" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-effect-of-waves-approaching-a-sandy-shore.png"><img width="600" height="201" class="wp-image-1048" alt="Figure 17.4 The effect of waves approaching a sandy shore [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/The-effect-of-waves-approaching-a-sandy-shore.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1048">Figure 17.4 The effect of waves approaching a sandy shore [SE]</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1049" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1049" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Greensand-Beach.jpg"><img width="600" height="271" class="wp-image-1049" alt="Figure 17.5 Waves breaking on the shore at Greensand Beach, Hawaii (the sand is green because it is made up mostly of the mineral olivine eroded from the nearby volcanic rocks) [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Greensand-Beach.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1049">Figure 17.5 Waves breaking on the shore at Greensand Beach, Hawaii (the sand is green because it is made up mostly of the mineral olivine eroded from the nearby volcanic rocks) [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Waves normally approach the shore at an angle, and this means that one part of the wave feels the bottom sooner than the rest of it, so the part that feels the bottom first slows down first. This process is illustrated in Figure 17.6, which is based on an aerial photograph showing actual waves approaching Long Beach on Vancouver Island. When the photo was taken, the waves (with crests shown as white lines in the diagram) were approaching at an angle of about 20° to the beach.

With every wave that washes up and then down the beach, particles of sediment are moved along the beach in a zigzag pattern.</p> <p>The combined effects of sediment transport within the surf zone by the longshore current and sediment movement along the beach by swash and backwash is known as <strong>longshore drift</strong>. Longshore drift moves a tremendous amount of sediment along coasts (both oceans and large lakes) around the world, and it is responsible for creating a variety of depositional features that we’ll discuss in section 17.3.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1053" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1053" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/swash-and-backwash.png"><img width="600" height="292" class="wp-image-1053" alt="Figure 17.8 The movement of particles on a beach as a result of swash and backwash [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/swash-and-backwash.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1053">Figure 17.8 The movement of particles on a beach as a result of swash and backwash [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A <strong>rip current</strong> is another type of current that develops in the nearshore area, and has the effect of returning water that has been pushed up to the shore by incoming waves.

Tide amplitudes in shoreline areas vary quite dramatically from place to place. On the west coast of Canada, the tidal range is relatively high, in some areas as much as 6 m, while on most of the east coast the range is lower, typically around 2 m. A major exception is the Bay of Fundy between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, where the daily range can be as great as 16 m. Anomalous tides like that are related to the shape and size of bays and inlets, which can significantly enhance the amplitude of the tidal surge. The Bay of Fundy has a natural oscillation cycle of 12.5 hours, and that matches the frequency of the rise and fall of the tides in the adjacent Atlantic Ocean. Ungava Bay, on Quebec’s north coast, has a similarly high tidal range.</p> <p>As the tides rise and fall they push and pull a large volume of water in and out of bays and inlets and around islands. They do not have as significant an impact on coastal erosion and deposition as wind waves do, but they have an important influence on the formation of features within the intertidal zone, as we’ll see in the following sections.</p> </div></div>

On irregular coasts, the headlands receive much more wave energy than the intervening bays, and thus they are more strongly eroded. The result of this is <strong>coastal straightening</strong>.

During the winter of 2012/2013, the arch collapsed, leaving a small stack at the end of the point.

But on almost all coasts, both deposition and erosion are happening to varying degrees most of the time, although in different places. This is clearly evident in the Tofino area of Vancouver Island (Figure 17.1), where erosion is the predominant process on the rocky headlands, while depositional processes predominate within the bays. On deposition-dominant coasts, the coastal sediments are still being eroded from some areas and deposited in others.</p> <p>The main factor in determining if a coast is dominated by erosion or deposition is its history of tectonic activity. A coast like that of British Columbia is tectonically active, and compression and uplift have been going on for tens of millions of years. This coast has also been uplifted during the past 15,000 years by isostatic rebound due to deglaciation. The coasts of the United States along the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico have not seen significant tectonic activity in a few hundred million years, and except in the northeast, have not experienced post-glacial uplift. These areas have relatively little topographic relief, and there is now minimal erosion of coastal bedrock.</p> <p>On coasts that are dominated by depositional processes, most of the sediment being deposited typically comes from large rivers. An obvious example is where the Mississippi River flows into the Gulf of Mexico at New Orleans; another is the Fraser River at Vancouver. There are no large rivers bringing sandy sediments to the west coast of Vancouver Island, but there are still long and wide sandy beaches there. In this area, most of the sand comes from glaciofluvial sand deposits situated along the shore behind the beach, and some comes from the erosion of the rocks on the headlands.</p> <p>The components of a typical beach are shown in Figure 17.16. On a sandy marine beach, the <strong>beach face</strong> is the area between the low and high tide levels. A <strong>berm</strong> is a flatter region beyond the reach of high tides; this area stays dry except during large storms.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1061" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1061" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/components-of-a-sandy-marine-beach.png"><img width="400" height="140" class="wp-image-1061" alt="Figure 17.16 The components of a sandy marine beach [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/components-of-a-sandy-marine-beach.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1061">Figure 17.16 The components of a sandy marine beach [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Most beaches go through a seasonal cycle because conditions change from summer to winter. In summer, sea conditions are relatively calm with long-wavelength, low-amplitude waves generated by distant winds. Winter conditions are rougher, with shorter-wavelength, higher-amplitude waves caused by strong local winds. As shown in Figure 17.17, the heavy seas of winter gradually erode sand from beaches, moving it to an underwater sandbar offshore from the beach. The gentler waves of summer gradually push this sand back toward the shore, creating a wider and flatter beach.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/differences-between-summer-and-winter-on-beaches.png"><img width="400" height="237" class="wp-image-1062" alt="Figure 17.17 The differences between summer and winter on beaches in areas where the winter conditions are rougher and waves have a shorter wavelength but higher energy.

[SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The evolution of sandy depositional features on sea coasts is primarily influenced by waves and currents, especially longshore currents. As sediment is transported along a shore, either it is deposited on beaches, or it creates other depositional features. A <strong>spit</strong>, for example is an elongated sandy deposit that extends out into open water in the direction of a longshore current. A good example is Goose Spit at Comox on Vancouver Island (Figure 17.18). At this location, the longshore current typically flows toward the southwest, and the sand eroded from a 60 m high cliff of Pleistocene glaciofluvial Quadra Sand is pushed in that direction and then out into Comox Harbour.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1053" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/comox-2.png"><img width="300" height="95" class="size-medium wp-image-1053" alt="Figure 17.18 The formation of Goose Spit at Comox on Vancouver Island.

There are numerous homes built at the top of the cliff, and the property owners have gone to considerable expense to reinforce the base of the cliff with large angular rocks (<strong>rip-rap</strong>) and concrete barriers so as to limit further erosion of their properties. One result of this will be to starve Goose Spit of sediments and eventually contribute to its erosion. Of course the rocks and concrete barriers are only temporary; they will be eroded by strong winter storms over the next few decades and the Quadra Sand will once again contribute to the maintenance of Goose Spit.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1064" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1064" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-Quadra-Sand-cliff.png"><img width="400" height="223" class="wp-image-1064" alt="Figure 17.19 The Quadra Sand cliff at Comox, and the extensive concrete and rip-rap barrier that has been constructed to reduce erosion.

Most bays have streams flowing into them, and since this water has to get out, it is rare that a baymouth bar will completely close the entrance to a bay.

There are three main mechanisms of sea-level change, as described below.</p> <p><strong>Eustatic</strong> <strong>sea-level changes</strong> are global sea-level changes related either to changes in the volume of glacial ice on land or to changes in the shape of the sea floor caused by plate tectonic processes. For example, changes in the rate of mid-ocean spreading will change the shape of the sea floor near the ridges, and this affects sea level.</p> <p>Over the past 20,000 years, there has been approximately 125 m of eustatic sea-level rise due to glacial melting. Most of that took place between 15,000 and 7,500 years ago during the major melting phase of the North American and Eurasian Ice Sheets (Figure 17.25). At around 7,500 years ago, the rate of glacial melting and sea-level rise decreased dramatically, and since that time, the average rate has been in the order of 0.7 mm/year. Anthropogenic climate change led to accelerating sea-level rise starting around 1870. Since that time, the average rate has been 1.1 mm/year, but it has been gradually increasing. Since 1992, the average rate has been 3.2 mm/year.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1071" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1071" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Eustatic-sea-level-curve-for-the-past-24-ka.png"><img class="wp-image-1071" alt="Figure 17.25 Eustatic sea-level curve for the past 24 ka (sea-level rise resulting from the melting of glacial ice).

Following the melting of this ice, there has been an isostatic rebound of continental crust in many areas. This ranges from several hundred metres of rebound in the central part of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (around Hudson Bay) to 100 m to 200 m in the peripheral parts of the Laurentide and Cordilleran Ice Sheets — in places such as Vancouver Island and the mainland coast of B.C. In other words, although global sea level was about 130 m lower during the last glaciation, the glaciated regions were depressed at least that much in most places, and more than that in places where the ice was thickest.</p> <p>There is evidence of isostatic rebound along the southwest coast of Vancouver Island, where a number of streams enter the ocean as 5 m high waterfalls, as shown in Figure 17.26.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1072" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1072" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/uplifted-by-post-glacial-isostatic-rebound.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1072" alt="Figure 17.26 This stream is on the southwest coast of Vancouver Island near Sooke.

The subduction of the Juan de Fuca Plate beneath British Columbia is creating tectonic uplift (about 1 mm/year) along the western edge of Vancouver Island, although much of this uplift is likely to be reversed when the next large subduction-zone earthquake strikes.</p> <p>Coastlines in areas where there has been net sea-level rise in the geologically recent past are commonly characterized by estuaries and fiords. Howe Sound, north of Vancouver, is an example of a fiord (Figure 17.27). This valley was filled with ice during the last glaciation, and there has been a net rise in sea level here since that time. Coastlines in areas where there has been net sea-level drop in the geologically recent past are characterized by uplifted wave-cut platforms (or stream valleys as shown in Figure 17.26). Uplifted beach lines are another product of relative sea-level drop, although these are difficult to recognize in areas with vigorous vegetation.

As already noted, the unintended effect of this installation will be to starve Goose Spit of sediment. As long as the armour remains in place, which might be several decades, there is a risk that the spit will start to erode, which will affect many of the organisms that use that area as their habitat, and many of the people who go there for recreation.</p> <p>Seawalls, like the one around Vancouver’s Stanley Park (Figure 17.28), also help to limit erosion and can be very pleasant amenities for the public, but they have geological and ecological costs. When a shoreline is “hardened” in this way, important marine habitat is lost and sediment production is reduced, and that can affect beaches elsewhere. Seawalls also affect the behaviour of waves and longshore currents, sometimes with negative results.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1055" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/stanley-2.png"><img width="300" height="162" class="size-medium wp-image-1055" alt="Figure 17.28 The seawall at Stanley Park, Vancouver [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seawall2.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/stanley-2-300x162.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 17.28 The seawall at Stanley Park, Vancouver [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Seawall2.jpg]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Another example is at Sunset Beach in Vancouver. As shown in Figure 17.29, a series of rip-rap <strong>breakwaters</strong> (structures parallel to the shore) were built in the 1990s and sand has accumulated behind them to form the beach. The breakwaters have acted as islands and the sand has been deposited in the low-energy water behind them, in the same way that a tombolo forms. This can be seen from a photograph taken from the Burrard Bridge in 2015 (Figure 17.30). The two benefits of this project are that a pleasant beach has been created, and some of the sediment that previously would have been moved into False Creek, and could have blocked its entrance, has been trapped in English Bay. The negative impacts are probably not well understood, but have likely involved loss of marine animal habitat.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1076" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1076" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Map-of-the-impact-of-breakwaters-.png"><img width="400" height="336" class="wp-image-1076" alt="Figure 17.29 Map of the impact of breakwaters (or groynes) on beach formation at Sunset Beach, Vancouver [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Map-of-the-impact-of-breakwaters-.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1076">Figure 17.29 Map of the impact of breakwaters (or groynes) on beach formation at Sunset Beach, Vancouver [SE]</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1077" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1077" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/impact-of-breakwaters-on-beach-development-at-Sunset-Beach.jpg"><img width="400" height="224" class="wp-image-1077" alt="Figure 17.30 Photograph of the impact of breakwaters on beach development at Sunset Beach, Vancouver [by Isaac Earle, used with permission]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/impact-of-breakwaters-on-beach-development-at-Sunset-Beach.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1077">Figure 17.30 Photograph of the impact of breakwaters on beach development at Sunset Beach, Vancouver [by Isaac Earle, used with permission]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Groynes</strong> (or groins in the U.S.) have an effect that is similar to that of breakwaters, although groynes are constructed perpendicular to the beach (Figure 17.31), and they trap sediment by slowing the longshore current.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1078" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1078" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/groyne-at-Crescent-Beach.jpg"><img width="400" height="200" class="wp-image-1078" alt="Figure 17.31 A groyne at Crescent Beach, Surrey, B.C.

The size of the waves depends on the wind speed, the area over which it is blowing, and time. The important parameters of a wave are its amplitude, wavelength, and speed. The water beneath a wave is disturbed to a depth of one-half the wavelength, and a wave is slowed when it approaches shallow water. A longshore current develops where waves approach the shore at an angle, and swash and backwash on a beach move sediment along the shore. The combined effect of these two processes is sediment transport by longshore drift.</td> </tr> <tr><th>17.2</th> <th>Landforms of Coastal Erosion</th> <td>Coasts that have experienced uplift within the past several million years tend to have irregular shapes and are dominated by erosional processes. Wave paths are bent where the coast is irregular and wave energy is focused on headlands. Rocky headlands are eroded into sea caves, arches, stacks, and sea cliffs, and the areas around these features are eroded into wave-cut platforms. Over the long term (millions of years), irregular coasts are straightened.</td> </tr> <tr><th>17.3</th> <th>Landforms of Coastal Deposition</th> <td>Coasts that have not been uplifted for tens of millions of years tend to be relatively straight, and are dominated by depositional features, although deposition is also important on irregular coasts. Waves and longshore drift are important in controlling the formation of beaches, as well as spits, tombolos, baymouth bars, and barrier islands. Beaches can be divided into zones, such as foreshore and backshore, and beach shapes typically change from season to season. Carbonate reefs and carbonate sediments form in tropical regions where there is little input of clastic sediments.</td> </tr> <tr><th>17.4</th> <th>Sea-Level Change</th> <td>The relative levels of the land and sea have significant implications for coastal processes and landforms, and they have been constantly changing over geological time. Eustatic sea-level changes are global in effect, and are typically related to glacial ice formation or melting. Isostatic sea-level changes are local effects caused by uplift or subsidence of continental crust, typically because of the gain or loss of glacial ice. Tectonic sea-level changes are related to plate interactions. Net sea-level rise leads to development of estuaries and fiords, while net sea-level drop creates uplifted marine terraces and beaches.</td> </tr> <tr><th>17.5</th> <th>Human Interference with Shorelines</th> <td>Humans have a strong urge to alter coasts for their own convenience by building seawalls, breakwaters, groynes, and other barriers. Although these types of features may have economic and other benefits, they can have both geological and ecological implications that must be considered.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1. What factors control the size of waves?</p> <p>2. Referring to Table 17.1, approximately what size of waves (amplitude and wavelength) would you expect with a 65 km/h wind blowing for 40 hours over 1,000 km of sea?</p> <p>3. If the average wavelength of a series of waves is 100 m, at what depth of water will the waves start to feel the bottom, and how will that change their behaviour?</p> <p>4. What is the difference between a longshore current and longshore drift?</p> <p>5. On this diagram, the waves (dashed blue lines) are approaching an irregular coast. The red arrows represent the energy of those waves, and one has been extended to show where that energy would hit the shore. Extend the other “energy lines” in a similar way, and comment on how this relates to erosion of this coastline.<a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/the-waves-dashed-blue-lines-are-approaching-an-irregular-coast.png"><img width="400" height="274" class="aligncenter wp-image-1080" alt="the waves (dashed blue lines) are approaching an irregular coast" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/the-waves-dashed-blue-lines-are-approaching-an-irregular-coast.png" /></a></p> <p>6. Explain the origins of a wave-cut platform.</p> <p>7. How do we define the limits of the beach face, and what are some other terms used to describe this zone?</p> <p>8. A spit is really just a beach that is only attached to the shore at one end. What conditions are necessary for the formation of a spit?</p> <p>9. Barrier islands are common along the Atlantic coast of the U.S. as far north as Massachusetts. Why are there almost none in the northeastern U.S. or along the coasts of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland?</p> <p>10. This diagram represents an island on the central coast of B.C. that has experienced 140 m of isostatic rebound since deglaciation, and has also been affected by the global eustatic sea-level rise over the same period.

The water they contain is critical to plate tectonics, to volcanism, and of course, to life on Earth. It is said that we know more about the surface of the Moon than the floor of the oceans. Whether this is true or not, the important point is that the ocean floor is covered with an average of nearly 4,000 m of water, and it’s pitch black below a few hundred metres so it’s not easy to discover what is down there. We know a lot more about the oceans than we used to, but there is still a great deal more to discover.</p> <p>Earth has had oceans for a very long time, dating back to the point where the surface had cooled enough to allow liquid water, only a few hundred million years after Earth’s formation. At that time there were no continental rocks, so the water that was here was likely spread out over the surface in one giant (but relatively shallow) ocean.</p></div>

The vast sediment-covered <strong>abyssal plains</strong> of the oceans are much flatter than any similar-sized areas on the continents.</p> <p>The main features of the Pacific Ocean floor are the continental slopes, which drop from about 200 m to several thousand metres over a distance of a few hundred kilometres; the abyssal plains — exceedingly flat and from 4,000 m to 6,000 m deep; volcanic seamounts and islands; and trenches at subduction zones that are up to 11,000 m deep.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1102" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1102" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/generalized-topography-of-the-Pacific-Ocean-sea-floor.png"><img class="wp-image-1102" alt="Figure 18.3 The generalized topography of the Pacific Ocean sea floor between Japan and British Columbia.

And, as you’ll remember from Chapter 10, the heavier oceanic crust floats lower on the mantle than continental crust does, and that’s why oceans are oceans.</p> <p>The continental shelf and slope offshore from Nova Scotia is shown in Figure 18.4. In this passive-margin area (no subduction zone), the shelf is over 150 km wide. On the Pacific coast of Canada, the shelf is less than half as wide. Continental shelves are typically less than 200 m in depth; 200 m is also the limit of the <strong>photic zone</strong>, the maximum depth to which sufficient light penetrates to allow photosynthesis to take place. As a result of that photosynthesis, the photic zone is oxygenated, and therefore suitable for animal life. Approximately 90% of marine life is restricted to the photic zone. The photic zone is also known as the <strong>epipelagic zone</strong>. The <strong>mesopelagic zone</strong> extends from 200 m to 1,000 m; the <strong>bathypelagic zone</strong> from 1,000 m to 4,000 m; and <strong>abyssalpelagic zone</strong> is deeper than 4,000 m.  (<strong>Pelagic</strong> refers to the open ocean, and thus excludes areas that are near to the shores or the ocean floor.)</p> <p>Although the temperature of the ocean surface varies widely, from a few degrees either side of freezing in polar regions to over 25°C in the tropics, in most parts of the ocean, the water temperature is around 10°C at 1,000 m depth and about 4°C from 2,000 m depth all the way to the bottom.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1103" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1103" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Atlantic-Ocean-floor-within-300-km-of-Nova-Scotia.png"><img class="wp-image-1103" alt="Figure 18.4 The generalized topography of the Atlantic Ocean floor within 300 km of Nova Scotia.

About 10% of the mantle rock melts under these conditions, producing mafic magma. This magma oozes out onto the sea floor to form pillow basalts (Figure 18.1), breccias (fragmented basaltic rock), and flows, interbedded in some cases with limestone or chert. Beneath the volcanic rock are layers with gabbroic sheeted dykes (which sometimes extend up into the pillow layer), gabbroic stocks, and finally layered peridotite (ultramafic rock) at the base. The ultramafic rock of the mantle lies below that. Over time, the igneous rock of the oceanic crust gets covered with layers of sediment, which eventually become sedimentary rock, including limestone, mudstone, chert, and turbidites. The lithologies of the layers of the oceanic crust are shown in Figure 18.6.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1106" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1106" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Schematic-representation-of-the-lithologic-layers.png"><img class="wp-image-1106" alt="Figure 18.6 Schematic representation of the lithologic layers of typical oceanic crust [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Schematic-representation-of-the-lithologic-layers.png" height="348" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1106">Figure 18.6 Schematic representation of the lithologic layers of typical oceanic crust [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The age of the oceanic crust has been determined by systematic mapping variations in the strength of the Earth’s magnetic field across the sea floor and comparing the results with our understanding of the record of Earth’s magnetic field reversal chronology for the past few hundred million years. The ages of different parts of the crust are shown in Figure 18.7. The oldest oceanic crust is around 280 Ma in the eastern Mediterranean, and the oldest parts of the open ocean are around 180 Ma on either side of the north Atlantic. It may be surprising, considering that parts of the continental crust are close to 4,000 Ma old, that the oldest sea floor is less than 300 Ma. Of course, the reason for this is that all sea floor older than that has been either subducted or pushed up to become part of the continental crust. For example, there are fragments of sea floor in British Columbia that date back to around 380 and 220 Ma, and there are similar rocks in the Canadian Shield that are older than 3 Ga.</p> <p>As one would expect, the oceanic crust is very young near the spreading ridges (Figure 18.7), and there are obvious differences in the rate of sea-floor spreading along different ridges. The ridges in the Pacific and southeastern Indian Oceans have wide age bands, indicating rapid spreading (approaching 10 cm/y on each side in some areas), while those in the Atlantic and western Indian Oceans are spreading much more slowly (less than 2 cm/y on each side in some areas).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1107" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-age-of-the-oceanic-crust.png"><img class="wp-image-1107" alt="Figure 18.7 The age of the oceanic crust [SE after NOAA at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/ocean_age/data/2008/image/age_oceanic_lith.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/The-age-of-the-oceanic-crust.png" height="205" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1107">Figure 18.7 The age of the oceanic crust [SE after NOAA at http://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/ocean_age/data/2008/image/age_oceanic_lith.jpg]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 18.2 The Age of Subducting Crust</strong></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Age-of-Subducting-Crust.png"><img class="alignleft wp-image-1108" alt="Age of Subducting Crust" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Age-of-Subducting-Crust.png" height="250" width="190" /></a>This map shows the magnetic patterns on the Juan de Fuca plate.

Almost all of these features are volcanoes, and most are much younger than the oceanic crust on which they formed. Some seamounts and ocean islands are formed above mantle plumes, the best example being Hawaii. The oldest of the Hawaiian/Emperor seamounts is dated at around 80 Ma; it is situated on oceanic crust aged around 90 to 100 Ma. The youngest of the Hawaiian lavas — at Kilauea Volcano on the island of Hawaii — is just a few hours old (or less!) and the island is surrounded by oceanic crust that is around 85 Ma old. All of the mantle-plume-derived volcanic islands are dominated by mafic rocks.</p> <p>Many seamounts are related to subduction along ocean-ocean convergent boundaries. These include the Aleutians, extending from Alaska to Russia, and the Lesser Antilles in the eastern part of the Caribbean.</p> <p>Some of the linear belts of volcanoes in the Pacific Ocean do not show age-distance relationships like the volcanoes of the Hawaii-Emperor chain or the Galapagos Islands. For example, the Line Islands, which spread out over more than 1,000 km south of the Hawaiian chain, were all formed between 70 and 85 Ma and are interpreted to be related to rifting.</p> <p>Most tropical islands have associated carbonate reefs, in some cases, as fringes right around the island, and in some cases, as barriers some distance away. In many cases, the reef is there, but the island that is assumed to have led to its formation is gone. The formation of <strong>fringing reefs</strong>, <strong>barrier reefs</strong>, and <strong>atolls</strong> is illustrated in Figure 18.8.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1109" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/fringing-reef-a-barrier-reef-and-an-atoll.png"><img class="wp-image-1109" alt="Figure 18.8 The formation of a fringing reef, a barrier reef, and an atoll around a subsiding tropical volcanic island.

This material comes from several different sources and is highly variable in composition, depending on proximity to a continent, water depth, ocean currents, biological activity, and climate. Sea-floor sediments (and sedimentary rocks) can range in thickness from a few millimetres to several tens of kilometres. Near the surface, the sea-floor sediments remain unconsolidated, but at depths of hundreds to thousands of metres (depending on the type of sediment and other factors) the sediment becomes lithified.</p> <p>The various sources of sea-floor sediment can be summarized as follows:</p> <ul><li><strong>Terrigenous</strong> sediment is derived from continental sources transported by rivers, wind, ocean currents, and glaciers. It is dominated by quartz, feldspar, clay minerals, iron oxides, and terrestrial organic matter.</li> <li>Pelagic carbonate sediment is derived from organisms (e.g., <strong>foraminifera</strong>) living in the ocean water (at various depths, but mostly near surface) that make their shells (a.k.a. <strong>tests</strong>) out of carbonate minerals such as calcite.</li> <li>Pelagic silica sediment is derived from marine organisms (e.g., <strong>diatoms</strong> and <strong>radiolaria</strong>) that make their tests out of silica (microcrystalline quartz).</li> <li>Volcanic ash and other volcanic materials are derived from both terrestrial and submarine eruptions.</li> <li>Iron and manganese nodules form as direct precipitates from ocean-bottom water.</li> </ul> <p>The distributions of some of these materials around the seas are shown in Figure 18.9. Terrigenous sediments predominate near the continents and within inland seas and large lakes. These sediments tend to be relatively coarse, typically containing sand and silt, but in some cases even pebbles and cobbles. Clay settles slowly in nearshore environments, but much of the clay is dispersed far from its source areas by ocean currents. Clay minerals are predominant over wide areas in the deepest parts of the ocean, and most of this clay is terrestrial in origin. Siliceous oozes (derived from radiolaria and diatoms) are common in the south polar region, along the equator in the Pacific, south of the Aleutian Islands, and within large parts of the Indian Ocean. Carbonate oozes are widely distributed in all of the oceans within equatorial and mid-latitude regions. In fact, clay settles everywhere in the oceans, but in areas where silica- and carbonate-producing organisms are prolific, they produce enough silica or carbonate sediment to dominate over clay.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1110" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-sediment-types-on-the-sea-floor.png"><img width="400" height="203" class="wp-image-1110" alt="Figure 18.9 The distribution of sediment types on the sea floor.

These tiny shells, and the even tinier fragments that form when they break into pieces, settle slowly through the water column, but they don’t necessarily make it to the bottom. While calcite is insoluble in surface water, its solubility increases with depth (and pressure) and at around 4,000 m, the carbonate fragments dissolve. This depth, which varies with latitude and water temperature, is known as the <strong>carbonate compensation depth</strong>, or CCD. As a result, carbonate oozes are absent from the deepest parts of the ocean (deeper than 4,000 m), but they are common in shallower areas such as the mid-Atlantic ridge, the East Pacific Rise (west of South America), along the trend of the Hawaiian/Emperor Seamounts (in the northern Pacific), and on the tops of many isolated seamounts.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1111" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Ambergris-Caye-area-of-Belize.jpg"><img width="400" height="162" class="wp-image-1111" alt="Figure 18.10 Foraminifera from the Ambergris Caye area of Belize.

Tiny fragments of this material plus other organic matter from marine plants and animals accumulate in terrigenous sediments, especially within a few hundred kilometres of shore. As the sediments pile up, the deeper parts start to warm up (from geothermal heat), and bacteria get to work breaking down the contained organic matter. Because this is happening in the absence of oxygen (a.k.a. <strong>anaerobic</strong> conditions), the by-product of this metabolism is the gas methane (CH4). Methane released by the bacteria slowly bubbles upward through the sediment toward the sea floor.</p> <p>At water depths of 500 m to 1,000 m, and at the low temperatures typical of the sea floor (close to 4°C), water and methane combine to create a substance known as <strong>methane hydrate</strong>. Within a few metres to hundreds of metres of the sea floor, the temperature is low enough for methane hydrate to be stable and hydrates accumulate within the sediment (Figure 18.11). Methane hydrate is flammable because when it is heated, the methane is released as a gas (Figure 18.11). The methane within sea-floor sediments represents an enormous reservoir of fossil fuel energy. Although energy corporations and governments are anxious to develop ways to produce and sell this methane, anyone that understands the climate-change implications of its extraction and use can see that this would be folly. As we’ll see in the discussion of climate change in Chapter 19, sea-floor methane hydrates have had significant impacts on the climate in the distant past.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1064" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/methane-hydrate-2.png"><img width="300" height="85" class="size-medium wp-image-1064" alt="Figure 18.11 Left: Methane hydrate within muddy sea-floor sediment from an area offshore from Oregon.

It is that way because the river water that flows into the oceans contains small amounts of dissolved ions, and for the most part, the water that comes out of the oceans is the pure water that evaporates from the surface. The salts of the ocean (dominated by sodium, chlorine, and sulphur) (Figure 18.12) are there because they are very soluble and they aren’t consumed by biological processes (most of the calcium, for example, is used by organisms to make carbonate minerals). If salts are always going into the ocean, and never coming out, one might assume that the oceans have been continuously getting saltier over geological time. In fact this appears not to be the case. There is geological evidence that Earth’s oceans became salty early during the Archaean, and that at times in the past, they have been at least half again as salty as they are now. This implies that there must be a mechanism to remove salt from the oceans, and that mechanism is the isolation of some parts of the ocean into seas (such as the Mediterranean) and the eventual evaporation of those seas to create salt beds that become part of the crust. The Middle Devonian Prairie Evaporite Formation of Saskatchewan and Manitoba is a good example of this.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1114" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1114" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/proportions-of-the-major-dissolved-elements-in-ocean-water.png"><img width="400" height="55" class="wp-image-1114" alt="Figure 18.12 The proportions (by weight) of the major dissolved elements in ocean water [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/proportions-of-the-major-dissolved-elements-in-ocean-water.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1114">Figure 18.12 The proportions (by weight) of the major dissolved elements in ocean water [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The average salinity of the oceans is 35 g of salt per litre of water, but there are significant regional variations in this value, as shown in Figure 18.13. Ocean water is least salty (around 31 g/L) in the Arctic, and also in several places where large rivers flow in (e.g., the Ganges/Brahmaputra and Mekong Rivers in southeast Asia, and the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers in China). Ocean water is most salty (over 37 g/L) in some restricted seas in hot dry regions, such as the Mediterranean and Red Seas. You might be surprised to know that, in spite of some massive rivers flowing into it (such as the Nile and the Danube), water does not flow out of the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic. There is so much evaporation happening in the Mediterranean basin that water flows into it from the Atlantic, through the Strait of Gibraltar.</p> <p>In the open ocean, salinities are elevated at lower latitudes because this is where most evaporation takes place. The highest salinities are in the subtropical parts of the Atlantic, especially north of the equator. The northern Atlantic is much more saline than the north Pacific because the Gulf Stream current brings a massive amount of salty water from the tropical Atlantic and the Caribbean to the region around Britain, Iceland, and Scandinavia. The salinity in the Norwegian Sea (between Norway and Iceland) is substantially higher than that in other polar areas.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1115" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1115" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans.png"><img width="400" height="210" class="wp-image-1115" alt="Figure 18.13 The distribution of salinity in Earth’s oceans and major seas [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png]" src="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans.png" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans.png 1005w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans-300x158.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans-65x34.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans-225x118.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-salinity-in-Earth’s-oceans-350x184.png 350w" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1115">Figure 18.13 The distribution of salinity in Earth’s oceans and major seas [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/WOA09_sea-surf_SAL_AYool.png]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 18.4 Salt Chuck </strong></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Salt-Chuck.jpg"><img width="163" height="150" class="alignleft wp-image-1116" alt="Salt Chuck" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Salt-Chuck.jpg" /></a>How salty is the sea? If you’ve ever swum in the ocean, you’ve probably tasted it. To understand how salty the sea is, start with 250 mL of water (1 cup). There is 35 g of salt in 1 L of seawater so in 250 mL (1/4 litre) there is 35/4 = 8.75 or ~9 g of salt. This is just short of 2 teaspoons, so it would be close enough to add 2 level teaspoons of salt to the cup of water. Then stir until it’s dissolved. Have a taste!</p> <p>Of course, if you used normal refined table salt, then what you added was almost pure NaCl. To get the real taste of seawater you would want to use some evaporated seawater salt (a.k.a. sea salt), which has a few percent of magnesium, sulphur, and calcium plus some trace elements. </p></div> </div> <p>Not unexpectedly, the oceans are warmest near the equator — typically 25° to 30°C — and coldest near the poles — around 0°C (Figure 18.14). (Sea water will remain unfrozen down to about -2°C.) At southern Canadian latitudes, average annual water temperatures are in the 10° to 15°C range on the west coast and in the 5° to 10°C range on the east coast. Variations in sea-surface temperatures (SST) are related to redistribution of water by ocean currents, as we’ll see below. A good example of that is the plume of warm Gulf Stream water that extends across the northern Atlantic. St. John’s, Newfoundland, and Brittany in France are at about the same latitude (47.5° N), but the average SST in St. John’s is a frigid 3°C, while that in Brittany is a reasonably comfortable 15°C.<strong> </strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1117" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1117" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/global-distribution-of-average-annual-sea-surface-temperatures.png"><img width="400" height="214" class="wp-image-1117" alt="Figure 18.14 The global distribution of average annual sea-surface temperatures https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/WOA09_sea-surf_TMP_AYool.png" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/global-distribution-of-average-annual-sea-surface-temperatures.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1117">Figure 18.14 The global distribution of average annual sea-surface temperatures https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/21/WOA09_sea-surf_TMP_AYool.png</div></div> <p>Currents in the open ocean are created by wind moving across the water and by density differences related to temperature and salinity. An overview of the main ocean currents is shown in Figure 18.15. As you can see, the northern hemisphere currents form circular patterns (<strong>gyres</strong>) that rotate clockwise, while the southern hemisphere gyres are counter-clockwise. This happens for the same reason that the water in your northern hemisphere sink rotates in a clockwise direction as it flows down the drain; this is caused by the <strong>Coriolis effect</strong>.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong> Exercise 18.5 Understanding the Coriolis Effect </strong></p> <p><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/coriolis-2.png"><img width="295" height="300" class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1063" alt="coriolis-2" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/coriolis-2-295x300.png" /></a>The Coriolis effect has to do with objects that are moving in relation to other objects that are rotating. An ocean current is moving across the rotating Earth, and its motion is controlled by the Coriolis effect.</p> <p>Imagine that you are standing on the equator looking straight north and you fire a gun in that direction. The bullet in the gun starts out going straight north, but it also has a component of motion toward the east that it gets from Earth’s rotation, which is 1,670 km/h at the equator. Because of the spherical shape of Earth, the speed of rotation away from the equator is not as fast as it is at the equator (in fact, the Earth’s rotational speed is 0 km/h at the poles) so the bullet actually traces a clockwise curved path across Earth’s surface, as shown on the diagram. The same thing happens to ocean currents and to tropical storms.  If Earth were a rotating cylinder, instead of a sphere, there would be no Coriolis effect. </p></div> </div> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>Because the ocean basins aren’t like bathroom basins, not all ocean currents behave the way we would expect. In the North Pacific, for example, the main current flows clockwise, but there is a secondary current in the area adjacent to our coast — the Alaska Current — that flows counter-clockwise, bringing relatively warm water from California, past Oregon, Washington, and B.C. to Alaska. On Canada’s eastern coast, the cold Labrador Current flows south past Newfoundland, bringing a stream of icebergs past the harbour at St. John’s (Figure 18.16). This current helps to deflect the Gulf Stream toward the northeast, ensuring that Newfoundland stays cool, and western Europe stays warm.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1119" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/the-main-open-ocean-currents.png"><img width="400" height="205" class="wp-image-1119" alt="Figure 18.15 Overview of the main open-ocean currents.

But there is much more going on underneath. The Gulf Stream, for example, which is warm and saline, flows past Britain and Iceland into the Norwegian Sea (where it becomes the Norwegian Current). As it cools down, it becomes denser, and because of its high salinity, which also contributes to its density, it starts to sink beneath the surrounding water (Figure 18.17). At this point, it is known as <strong>North Atlantic Deep Water</strong> (NADW), and it flows to significant depth in the Atlantic as it heads back south. Meanwhile, at the southern extreme of the Atlantic, very cold water adjacent to Antarctica also sinks to the bottom to become <strong>Antarctic Bottom Water</strong> (AABW) which flows to the north, underneath the NADW.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1121" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section.png"><img width="400" height="144" class="wp-image-1121" alt="Figure 18.17 A depiction of the vertical movement of water along a north-south cross-section through the Atlantic basin [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/vertical-movement-of-water-along-a-north-south-cross-section.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1121">Figure 18.17 A depiction of the vertical movement of water along a north-south cross-section through the Atlantic basin [SE]</div></div> <p>The descent of the dense NADW is just one part of a global system of seawater circulation, both at surface and at depth, as illustrated in Figure 18.18.

It brings warm water from the tropics to the poles, and cold water from the poles to the tropics, thus keeping polar regions from getting too cold and tropical regions from getting too hot. A reduction in the rate of thermohaline circulation would lead to colder conditions and enhanced formation of sea ice at the poles. This would start a positive feedback process that could result in significant global cooling. There is compelling evidence to indicate that there were major changes in thermohaline circulation, corresponding with climate changes, during the Pleistocene Glaciation.</p> </div></div>

The oldest parts of the sea floor are older than 200 Ma, but most of the sea floor is younger than 100 Ma. Seamounts are common and almost all are volcanoes, related to mantle plumes, subduction, or other processes. In tropical regions, ocean islands tend to be surrounded by carbonate reefs.</td> </tr> <tr><th>18.3</th> <th>Sea-Floor Sediments</th> <td>Almost all of the sea floor is covered by young sediments and sedimentary rocks, derived either from erosion of continents or from marine biological processes. Clastic sediments, some quite coarse, predominate on shelves and slopes. Terrigenous clays are distributed across the sea floor, but in areas where either carbonate- or silica-forming organisms thrive, the sediments are likely to be dominated by carbonate or silica oozes. Methane hydrates, derived from bacterial decomposition of organic matter, form within sediments on shelves and slopes.</td> </tr> <tr><th>18.4</th> <th>Ocean Water</th> <td>Average ocean water has about 35 g/L of salt, mostly made up of chlorine and sodium, but also including magnesium, sulphur, and calcium. Salinity levels are highest in the tropics where evaporation is greatest. Sea-surface temperatures range from less than 0°C at the poles to over 25°C in equatorial regions. Open-ocean currents, which generally rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and counter-clockwise in the south, are critically important in redistributing heat on Earth. Deep-ocean currents, driven by density differences, are another key part of the heat redistribution system. Changes to current patterns or intensity have significant implications for global climate.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

In the geological record, we can see this in the evidence of glaciations in the distant past (see section 16.1 in Chapter 16), and we can also detect periods of extreme warmth by looking at the isotope composition of sea-floor sediments, such as those in the core shown in Figure 19.1. Not only has the climate changed frequently, the temperature fluctuations have been very significant. Today’s mean global temperature is about 15°C. During Snowball Earth times, the global mean was as cold as -50°C, while at various times during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic and during the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum, it was close to +30°C.</p> <p>But in spite of these dramatic climate changes, Earth has been habitable from very early in its history — as soon as liquid water was present — right through to the present day. That continuous habitability is perhaps a little more surprising than you might think, as we’ll see below.</p> <p>A significant part of this chapter is about the natural processes of climate change and how they work. It’s critically important to be aware of those natural climate change processes if we want to understand anthropogenic climate change. First, this awareness helps us to understand why our activities are causing the present-day climate to change, and second, it allows us to distinguish between natural and anthropogenic processes in the climate record of the past 250 years.</p></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-19-1-what-makes-the-climate-change" title="19.1 What Makes the Climate Change?"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">107</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">19.1 What Makes the Climate Change?</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"><p>There are two parts to climate change, the first one is known as <strong>climate forcing</strong>, which is when conditions change to give the climate a little nudge in one direction or the other. The second part of climate change, and the one that typically does most of the work, is what we call a <strong>feedback</strong>. When a climate forcing changes the climate a little, a whole series of environmental changes take place, many of which either exaggerate the initial change (<strong>positive feedbacks</strong>), or suppress the change (<strong>negative feedbacks</strong>).</p> <p>An example of a climate-forcing mechanism is the increase in the amount of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) in the atmosphere that results from our use of fossil fuels. CO<sub>2</sub> traps heat in the atmosphere and leads to climate warming. Warming changes vegetation patterns; contributes to the melting of snow, ice, and <strong>permafrost</strong>; causes sea level to rise; reduces the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in sea water; and has a number of other minor effects. Most of these changes contribute to more warming. Melting of permafrost, for example, is a strong positive feedback because frozen soil contains trapped organic matter that is converted to CO<sub>2</sub> and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) when the soil thaws. Both these gases accumulate in the atmosphere and add to the warming effect. On the other hand, if warming causes more vegetation growth, that vegetation should absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, thus reducing the warming effect, which would be a negative feedback. Under our current conditions — a planet that still has lots of glacial ice and permafrost — most of the feedbacks that result from a warming climate are positive feedbacks and so the climate changes that we cause get naturally amplified by natural processes.</p> <h3>What is a greenhouse gas?</h3> <p>Throughout this chapter we’ll be talking about the role of <strong>greenhouse gases</strong> (GHGs) in controlling the climate, so it’s important to understand what greenhouse gases are and how they work. As you know, the dominant gases of the atmosphere are nitrogen (as N<sub>2</sub>) and oxygen (as O<sub>2</sub>). These gas molecules have only two atoms each and are not GHGs. Some of the other important gases of the atmosphere are water vapour (H<sub>2</sub>O), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). All of these have more than two atoms, and they are GHGs.<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/co2-vibrations-2.png"><img width="163" height="300" class="size-medium wp-image-1068 aligncenter" alt="co2-vibrations-2" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/co2-vibrations-2-163x300.png" /></a></p> <p>All molecules vibrate at various frequencies and in various ways, and some of those vibrations take place at frequencies within the range of the infrared (IR) radiation that is emitted by Earth’s surface. Gases with two atoms, such as O<sub>2</sub>, can only vibrate by stretching (back and forth), and those vibrations are much faster than the IR radiation. Gases with three or more atoms (such as CO<sub>2</sub>) vibrate by stretching as well, but they can also vibrate in other ways, such as by bending. Those vibrations are slower and match IR radiation frequencies.</p> <p>When IR radiation interacts with CO<sub>2</sub> or with one of the other GHGs, the molecular vibrations are enhanced because there is a match between the wavelength of the light and the vibrational frequency of the molecule. This makes the molecule vibrate more vigorously, heating the surrounding air in the process. These molecules also emit IR radiation in all directions, some of which reaches Earth’s surface and causes the <strong>greenhouse effect</strong>.</p> <h1><strong>Natural Climate Forcing</strong></h1> <p>Natural climate forcing has been going on throughout geological time. A wide range of processes has been operating at widely different time scales, from a few years to billions of years.</p> <p>The longest-term natural forcing variation is related to the evolution of the Sun. Like most other stars of a similar mass, our Sun is evolving. For the past 4.57 billion years, its rate of nuclear fusion has been increasing, and it is now emitting about 40% more energy (as light) than it did at the beginning of geological time (Figure 19.2). A difference of 40% is big, so it’s a little surprising that the temperature on Earth has remained at a reasonable and habitable temperature for all of this time. The mechanism for that relative climate stability has been the evolution of our atmosphere from one that was dominated by CO2, and also had significant levels of CH4 — both GHGs — to one with only a few hundred parts per million of CO2 and just under 1 part per million of CH4. Those changes to our atmosphere have been no accident; over geological time, life and its metabolic processes have evolved and changed the atmosphere to conditions that remained cool enough to be habitable. A scientific explanation for how this could happen is known as the <strong>Gaia hypothesis</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1237" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/life-cycle-of-our-Sun.png"><img width="400" height="99" class="wp-image-1237" alt="Figure 19.2 The life cycle of our Sun and of other similar stars [from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Solar_Life_Cycle.svg/2000px-Solar_Life_Cycle.svg.png]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/life-cycle-of-our-Sun-1024x254.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1237">Figure 19.2 The life cycle of our Sun and of other similar stars [from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/Solar_Life_Cycle.svg/2000px-Solar_Life_Cycle.svg.png]</div></div> <h2>The Gaia hypothesis</h2> <p>The Gaia hypothesis, developed by British scientist and environmentalist James Lovelock in the 1960s, is the theory that organisms evolve in ways that contribute to ensuring that their environment remains habitable. It does not include any sort of coordination of effort among organisms or any consciousness of a need to make changes. Gaia is not a superorganism. A way of understanding Gaia is through Lovelock’s simple Daisyworld model. A planet with a warming star is populated only by two types of daisies, white ones and black ones. The black ones contribute to warming because they absorb solar energy, while the white ones reflect light and contribute to cooling. As the star’s luminosity gradually increases, the white daisies have better outcomes because their reflectivity cools their local environment, while the black daisies, suffering from the heat, do not reproduce as well. Over time white daisies gradually dominate the population, but eventually the star becomes so bright that even white daisies cannot compensate, and all of the daisies perish. Obviously Earth is not Daisyworld, but similar processes — such as the evolution of photosynthetic bacteria that consume CO<sub>2</sub> — have taken place that influence the atmosphere and moderate the climate.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Gaia-hypothesis.png"><img width="216" height="400" class="aligncenter wp-image-1235" alt="Gaia hypothesis" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Gaia-hypothesis.png" /></a></p> <p>You can read more about Lovelock, Gaia, and Daisyworld by searching the Internet using any one of those terms. [SE]</p> <p>Plate tectonic processes contribute to climate forcing in several different ways, and on time scales ranging from tens of millions to hundreds of millions of years. One mechanism is related to continental position. For example, we know that Gondwana (South America + Africa + Antarctica + Australia) was positioned over the South Pole between about 450 and 250 Ma, during which time there were two major glaciations (Andean-Saharan and Karoo) affecting the South polar regions (Figure 16.2) and cooling the rest of the planet at the same time. Another mechanism is related to continental collisions. As described in Chapter 16, the collision between India and Asia, which started at around 50 Ma, resulted in massive tectonic uplift. The consequent accelerated weathering of this rugged terrain consumed CO<sub>2</sub> from the atmosphere and contributed to gradual cooling over the remainder of the Cenozoic. Also, as described in Chapter 16, the opening of the Drake Passage — due to plate-tectonic separation of South America from Antarctica — led to the development of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, which isolated Antarctica from the warmer water in the rest of the ocean and thus contributed to Antarctic glaciation starting at around 35 Ma.<strong> </strong></p> <p>As we discussed in Chapter 4, volcanic eruptions don’t just involve lava flows and exploding rock fragments; various particulates and gases are also released, the important ones being sulphur dioxide and CO<sub>2</sub>. Sulphur dioxide is an aerosol that reflects incoming solar radiation and has a net cooling effect that is short lived (a few years in most cases, as the particulates settle out of the atmosphere within a couple of years), and doesn’t typically contribute to longer-term climate change. Volcanic CO<sub>2</sub> emissions can contribute to climate warming but only if a greater-than-average level of volcanism is sustained over a long time (at least tens of thousands of years). It is widely believed that the catastrophic end-Permian extinction (at 250 Ma) resulted from warming initiated by the eruption of the massive Siberian Traps over a period of at least a million years.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 19.1 Climate Change at the K-Pg Boundary</strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1236" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Climate-Change-at-the-K-Pg-Boundary.png"><img width="200" height="251" class="wp-image-1236" alt="Climate Change at the K-Pg Boundary" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Climate-Change-at-the-K-Pg-Boundary.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1236">[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e5/KT-impact.gif]</div></div> <p>The large extraterrestrial impact at the end of the Cretaceous (Cretaceous-Paleogene or K-Pg boundary, a.k.a.

First, the shape of the orbit changes on a regular time scale — close to 100,000 years — from being close to circular to being very slightly elliptical. But the circularity of the orbit is not what matters; it is the fact that as the orbit becomes more elliptical, the position of the Sun within that ellipse becomes less central or more eccentric (Figure 19.3a). <strong>Eccentricity</strong> is important because when it is high, the Earth-Sun distance varies more from season to season than it does when eccentricity is low.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1073" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/milankovitch.png"><img width="300" height="123" class="size-medium wp-image-1073" alt="Figure 19.3 The cycles of Earth’s orbit and rotation [a: SE after https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Eccentricity_zero.svg/1163px-Eccentricity_zero.svg.png], b: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Earth_obliquity_range.svg/2000px-Earth_obliquity_range.svg.png] c: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/ Earth_precession.svg/2000px-Earth_precession.svg.png]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/milankovitch-300x123.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 19.3 The cycles of Earth’s orbit and rotation [a: SE after https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Eccentricity_zero.svg/1163px-Eccentricity_zero.svg.png], b: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/ae/Earth_obliquity_range.svg/2000px-Earth_obliquity_range.svg.png] c: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/43/ Earth_precession.svg/2000px-Earth_precession.svg.png]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Second, Earth rotates around an axis through the North and South Poles, and that axis is at an angle to the plane of Earth’s orbit around the Sun (Figure 19.3b). The angle of tilt (also known as <strong>obliquity</strong>) varies on a time scale of 41,000 years. When the angle is at its maximum (24.5°), Earth’s seasonal differences are accentuated. When the angle is at its minimum (22.1°), seasonal differences are minimized. The current hypothesis is that glaciation is favoured at low seasonal differences as summers would be cooler and snow would be less likely to melt and more likely to accumulate from year to year.</p> <p>Third, the direction in which Earth’s rotational axis points also varies, on a time scale of about 20,000 years (Figure 19.3c). This variation, known as <strong>precession</strong>, means that although the North Pole is presently pointing to the star Polaris (the pole star), in 10,000 years it will point to the star Vega.</p> <p>The importance of eccentricity, tilt, and precession to Earth’s climate cycles (now known as <strong>Milankovitch Cycles</strong>) was first pointed out by Yugoslavian engineer and mathematician Milutin Milankovitch in the early 1900s. Milankovitch recognized that although the variations in the orbital cycles did not affect the total amount of <strong>insolation</strong> (light energy from the Sun) that Earth received, it did affect where on Earth that energy was strongest. Glaciations are most sensitive to the insolation received at latitudes of around 65°, and with the current configuration of continents, it would have to be 65° north (because there is almost no land at 65° south). The most important issues are whether the northern hemisphere is pointing toward the Sun at its closest or farthest approach, and how eccentric the Sun’s position is in Earth’s orbit. Two opposing situations are illustrated in Figure 19.4. In the upper panel, the northern hemisphere is at it farthest distance from the Sun during summer, which means cooler summers. In the lower panel, the northern hemisphere is at its closest distance to the Sun during summer, which means hotter summers. Cool summers — as opposed to cold winters — are the key factor in the accumulation of glacial ice, so the upper scenario in Figure 19.4 is the one that promotes glaciation. This factor is greatest when eccentricity is high.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1239" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1239" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/effect-of-precession-on-insolation-in-the-northern-hemisphere-summers.png"><img width="400" height="169" class="wp-image-1239" alt="Figure 19.4 The effect of precession on insolation in the northern hemisphere summers.

Glacial ice cores show clear evidence of changes in the Gulf Stream (and other parts of the thermohaline circulation system) that affected global climate on a time scale of about 1,500 years during the last glaciation. The east-west changes in sea-surface temperature and surface pressure in the equatorial Pacific Ocean — known as the El Niño Southern Oscillation or ENSO — varies on a much shorter time scale of between two and seven years. These variations tend to garner the attention of the public because they have significant climate implications in many parts of the world. The past 65 years of ENSO index values are shown in Figure 19.6. The strongest <strong>El Niños</strong> in recent decades were in 1983 and 1998, and those were both very warm years from a global perspective. During a strong El Niño, the equatorial Pacific sea-surface temperatures are warmer than normal and heat the atmosphere above the ocean, which leads to warmer-than-average global temperatures.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1069" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/enso-2016.png"><img width="300" height="106" class="size-medium wp-image-1069" alt="Figure 19.6 Variations in the ENSO index from 1950 to mid-2016 [SE after NOAA at: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/enso-2016-300x106.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1069">Figure 19.6 Variations in the ENSO index from 1950 to early-2016 [SE after NOAA at: http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/enso/mei/]</div></div> <h1><strong>Climate Feedbacks</strong></h1> <p>As already stated, <strong>climate feedbacks</strong> are critically important in amplifying weak climate forcings into full-blown climate changes. When Milankovitch published his theory in 1924, it was widely ignored, partly because it was evident to climate scientists that the forcing produced by the orbital variations was not strong enough to drive the significant climate changes of the glacial cycles. Those scientists did not recognize the power of positive feedbacks. It wasn’t until 1973, 15 years after Milankovitch’s death, that sufficiently high-resolution data were available to show that the Pleistocene glaciations were indeed driven by the orbital cycles, and it became evident that the orbital cycles were just the forcing that initiated a range of feedback mechanisms that made the climate change.</p> <p>Since Earth still has a very large volume of ice — mostly in the continental ice sheets of Antarctica and Greenland, but also in alpine glaciers and permafrost — melting is one of the key feedback mechanisms. Melting of ice and snow leads to several different types of feedbacks, an important one being a change in <strong>albedo</strong>. Albedo is a measure of the reflectivity of a surface. Earth’s various surfaces have widely differing albedos, expressed as the percentage of light that reflects off a given material. This is important because most solar energy that hits a very reflective surface is not absorbed and therefore does little to warm Earth. Water in the oceans or on a lake is one of the darkest surfaces, reflecting less than 10% of the incident light, while clouds and snow or ice are among the brightest surfaces, reflecting 70% to 90% of the incident light (Figure 19.7).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1242" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1242" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces.png"><img width="400" height="132" class="wp-image-1242" alt="Figure 19.7 Typical albedo values for Earth surfaces [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Typical-albedo-values-for-Earth-surfaces-1024x339.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1242">Figure 19.7 Typical albedo values for Earth surfaces [SE]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 19.2 Albedo Implications of Forest Harvesting</strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1243" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1243" style="width: 227px"><img width="227" height="188" class="wp-image-1243" alt="Albedo Implications of Forest Harvesting" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Albedo-Implications-of-Forest-Harvesting.png" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1243">[https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/66/Clearcutting-Oregon.jpg]</div></div> <p>When a forest is harvested, there are significant changes to the rate of biological uptake of CO<sub>2</sub>, but there is also a change in albedo. Using Figure 19.7, and assuming that a clear-cut has an albedo similar to sand, what is the albedo-only implication of clear-cutting for climate change?Be aware that this implication applies only to the albedo change caused by clear-cutting. Clear-cutting reduces the capacity of the area to absorb CO<sub>2</sub>, and also has numerous negative ecological and geological implications.</p></div> </div> <p>When sea ice melts, as it has done in the Arctic Ocean at a disturbing rate over the past decade, the albedo of the area affected changes dramatically, from around 80% down to less than 10%. Much more solar energy is absorbed by the water than by the pre-existing ice, and the temperature increase is amplified. The same applies to ice and snow on land, but the difference in albedo is not as great.<strong> </strong></p> <p>When ice and snow on land melt, sea level rises. (Sea level is also rising because the oceans are warming and that increases their volume.) A higher sea level means a larger proportion of the planet is covered with water, and since water has a lower albedo than land, more heat is absorbed and the temperature goes up a little more. Since the last glaciation, sea-level rise has been about 125 m; a huge area that used to be land is now flooded by heat-absorbent seawater. During the current period of anthropogenic climate change, sea level has risen only about 20 cm, and although that doesn’t make a big change to albedo, sea-level rise is accelerating.</p> <p>Most of northern Canada has a layer of permafrost that ranges from a few centimetres to hundreds of metres in thickness; the same applies in Alaska, Russia, and Scandinavia. Permafrost is a mixture of soil and ice (Figure 19.8), and it also contains a significant amount of trapped organic carbon that is released as CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> when the permafrost breaks down. Because the amount of carbon stored in permafrost is in the same order of magnitude as the amount released by burning fossil fuels, this is a feedback mechanism that has the potential to equal or surpass the forcing that has unleashed it.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1244" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1244" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/degrading-permafrost-site.jpg"><img width="400" height="231" class="wp-image-1244" alt="Figure 19.8 A degrading permafrost site on the north coast of Alaska [http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/interdisciplinary_science/cae/images/theme2_fig2_lg.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/degrading-permafrost-site-1024x591.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1244">Figure 19.8 A degrading permafrost site on the north coast of Alaska [http://alaska.usgs.gov/science/interdisciplinary_science/cae/images/theme2_fig2_lg.jpg]</div></div> <p>In some polar regions, including northern Canada, permafrost includes methane hydrate (see section 18.3), a highly concentrated form of CH4 trapped in solid form. Breakdown of permafrost releases this CH4. Even larger reserves of methane hydrate exist on the sea floor, and while it would take significant warming of ocean water down to a depth of hundreds of metres, this too is likely to happen in the future if we don’t limit our impact on the climate. There is strong isotopic evidence that the Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (see Figure 19.1) was caused, at least in part, by a massive release of sea-floor methane hydrate.</p> <p>There is about 45 times as much carbon in the ocean (as dissolved bicarbonate ions, HCO<sub>3</sub>-) as there is in the atmosphere (as CO<sub>2</sub>), and there is a steady exchange of carbon between the two reservoirs. But the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in water decreases as the temperature goes up. In other words, the warmer it gets, the more of that oceanic bicarbonate gets transferred to the atmosphere as CO<sub>2</sub>. That makes CO<sub>2</sub> solubility another positive feedback mechanism.</p> <p>Vegetation growth responds positively to both increased temperatures and elevated CO<sub>2</sub> levels, and so in general, it represents a negative feedback to climate change because the more the vegetation grows, the more CO<sub>2</sub> is taken from the atmosphere. But it’s not quite that simple because when trees grow bigger and more vigorously, forests become darker (they have lower albedo) so they absorb more heat. Furthermore, climate warming isn’t necessarily good for vegetation growth; some areas have become too hot, too dry, or even too wet to support the plant community that was growing there, and it might take centuries for something to replace it successfully.</p> <p>All of these positive (and negative) feedbacks work both ways. For example, during climate cooling, growth of glaciers leads to higher albedos, and formation of permafrost results in storage of carbon that would otherwise have returned quickly to the atmosphere.</p> </div></div>

That was around the middle of the 18th century. The issue with fossil fuels is that they involve burning carbon that was naturally stored in the crust over hundreds of millions of years as part of Earth’s process of counteracting the warming Sun.</p> <p>Some climate scientists argue that anthropogenic climate change actually goes back much further than the industrial era, and that humans began to impact the climate by clearing land to grow grains in Europe and the Middle East around 8,000 years BCE and by creating wetlands to grow rice in Asia around 5,000 years BCE. Clearing forests for crops is a type of climate-forcing because the CO<sub>2</sub> storage capacity of the crops is generally lower than that of the trees they replace, and creating wetlands is a type of climate forcing because the anaerobic bacterial decay of organic matter within wetlands produces CH<sub>4</sub>.</p> <p>In fact, whether anthropogenic climate change started with the agricultural revolution or the industrial revolution is not important, because the really significant climate changes didn’t start until the early part of the 20th century, and although our activities are a major part of the problem, our increasing numbers are a big issue as well. Figure 19.9 shows the growth of the world population from around 5 million, when we first started growing crops, to about 18 million when wetland rice cultivation began, to over 800 million at the start of the industrial revolution, to over 7,300 million today. A big part of the incredible growth in our population is related to the availability of the cheap and abundant energy embodied in fossil fuels, which we use for transportation, heating and cooling, industry, and food production. It will be hard to support a population of this size without fossil fuels, but we have to find a way to do it.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1245" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1245" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png"><img width="400" height="186" class="wp-image-1245" alt="Figure 19.9 World population growth over the past 12,000 years [by SE from data at: http://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/WorldPopulationAnnual12000years_interpolated_HYDEandUN/WorldPopulationAnnual12000years_interpolated_HYDEandUN.csv]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/World-population-growth-over-the-past-12000-years-.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1245">Figure 19.9 World population growth over the past 12,000 years [by SE from data at: http://ourworldindata.org/roser/graphs/WorldPopulationAnnual12000years_interpolated_HYDEandUN/WorldPopulationAnnual12000years_interpolated_HYDEandUN.csv]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A rapidly rising population, the escalating level of industrialization and mechanization of our lives, and an increasing dependence on fossil fuels have driven the anthropogenic climate change of the past century. The trend of mean global temperatures since 1880 is shown in Figure 19.10. For approximately the past 55 years, the temperature has increased at a relatively steady and disturbingly rapid rate, especially compared to past changes. The average temperature now is approximately 0.8°C higher than before industrialization, and two-thirds of this warming has occurred since 1975. One of the driving factors of the recent increase in the rate of climate change has been the migration of North Americans from city centres to the suburbs, and the resulting need for virtually every household to own at least one car, when previously they were able to get around on foot or public transit.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1070" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/giss-ls-2015.png"><img width="300" height="185" class="size-medium wp-image-1070" alt="Figure 19.10 Global mean annual temperatures for the period from 1880 to 2015 [by SE from data at NASA at: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/giss-ls-2015-300x185.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 19.10 Global mean annual temperatures for the period from 1880 to 2015 [by SE from data at NASA at: http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/tabledata_v3/GLB.Ts+dSST.txt]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The <strong>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</strong> (IPCC), established by the United Nations in 1988, is responsible for reviewing the scientific literature on climate change and issuing periodic reports on several topics, including the scientific basis for understanding climate change, our vulnerability to observed and predicted climate changes, and what we can do to limit climate change and minimize its impacts. Figure 19.11, from the fifth report of the IPCC, issued in 2014, shows the relative contributions of various GHGs and other factors to current climate forcing, based on the changes from levels that existed in 1750. Figure 19.12 shows the IPCC’s projections for temperature increases over the next 100 years.</p> <p>The biggest anthropogenic contributor to warming is the emission of CO<sub>2</sub>, which accounts for 50% of positive forcing. CH<sub>4</sub> and its atmospheric derivatives (CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>O, and O<sub>3</sub>) account for 29%, and the halocarbon gases (mostly leaked from air-conditioning appliances) and nitrous oxide (N<sub>2</sub>O) (from burning fossils fuels) account for 5% each. Carbon monoxide (CO) (also produced by burning fossil fuels) accounts for 7%, and the volatile organic compounds other than methane (NMVOC) account for 3%.</p> <p>CO2 emissions come mostly from coal- and gas-fired power stations, motorized vehicles (cars, trucks, and aircraft), and industrial operations (e.g., smelting), and indirectly from forestry. CH<sub>4</sub> emissions come from production of fossil fuels (escape from coal mining and from gas and oil production), livestock farming (mostly beef), landfills, and wetland rice farming. N<sub>2</sub>O and CO come mostly from the combustion of fossil fuels. In summary, close to 70% of our current GHG emissions come from fossil fuel production and use, while most of the rest comes from agriculture and landfills.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1247" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/importance-of-factors-that-are-contributing-to-anthropogenic-warming.jpg"><img width="400" height="336" class="wp-image-1247" alt="Figure 19.11 The relative importance of factors that are contributing to anthropogenic warming [from http://www.ipcc.ch/report/graphics/index.php?t=Assessment%20Reports&amp;r=AR5%20-%20WG1&amp;f=SPM]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/importance-of-factors-that-are-contributing-to-anthropogenic-warming-1024x860.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1247">Figure 19.11 The relative importance of factors that are contributing to anthropogenic warming [from http://www.ipcc.ch/report/graphics/index.php?t=Assessment%20Reports&amp;r=AR5%20-%20WG1&amp;f=SPM]</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 19.3 What Does Radiative Forcing Tell Us?</strong></p> <p>The bottom part of Figure 19.11 shows the total radiative forcing levels for 2011, 1980, and 1950, expressed relative to the forcing that existed in 1750.

However, it’s not straightforward for climatologists to make the connection between a warming climate and specific weather events, and most are justifiably reluctant to ascribe any specific event to climate change. In this respect, the best measures of climate change are those that we can detect over several decades, such as the temperature changes shown in Figure 19.10, or the sea-level rise shown in Figure 19.13. As already stated, sea level has risen approximately 20 cm since 1750, and that rise is attributed to both warming (and therefore expanding) seawater and melting glaciers and other land-based snow and ice (melting of sea ice does not contribute directly to sea-level rise as it is already floating in the ocean).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1249" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1249" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Projected-sea-level-increases-to-2100.png"><img width="400" height="244" class="wp-image-1249" alt="Figure 19.13 Projected sea-level increases to 2100, showing likely range (grey) and possible maximum [Adapted by SE from: http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise#intro-section-2 based on data in Parris et al., 2012, NOAA]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Projected-sea-level-increases-to-2100.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1249">Figure 19.13 Projected sea-level increases to 2100, showing likely range (grey) and possible maximum [Adapted by SE from: http://nca2014.globalchange.gov/report/our-changing-climate/sea-level-rise#intro-section-2 based on data in Parris et al., 2012, NOAA]</div></div> <p>Projections for sea-level rise to the end of this century vary widely. This is in large part because we do not know which of the above climate change scenarios (Figure 19.12) we will most closely follow, but many are in the range from 0.5 m to 2.0 m. One of the problems in predicting sea-level rise is that we do not have a strong understanding of how large ice sheets, such as Greenland and Antarctica, will respond to future warming. Another issue is that the oceans don’t respond immediately to warming. For example, with the current amount of warming, we are already committed to a future sea-level rise of between 1.3 m and 1.9 m, even if we could stop climate change today. This is because it takes decades to centuries for the existing warming of the atmosphere to be transmitted to depth within the oceans and to exert its full impact on large glaciers. Most of that committed rise would take place over the next century, but some would be delayed longer. And for every decade that the current rates of climate change continue, that number increases by another 0.3 m. In other words, if we don’t make changes quickly, by the end of this century we’ll be locked into 3 m of future sea-level rise.</p> <p>In a 2008 report, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) estimated that by 2070 approximately 150 million people living in coastal areas could be at risk of flooding due to the combined effects of sea-level rise, increased storm intensity, and land subsidence. The assets at risk (buildings, roads, bridges, ports, etc.) are in the order of $35 trillion ($35,000,000,000,000). Countries with the greatest exposure of population to flooding are China, India, Bangladesh, Vietnam, U.S.A., Japan, and Thailand. Some of the major cities at risk include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Mumbai, Kolkata, Dhaka, Ho Chi Minh City, Tokyo, Miami, and New York.</p> <p>One of the other risks for coastal populations, besides sea-level rise, is that climate warming is also associated with an increase in the intensity of tropical storms (e.g., hurricanes or typhoons), which almost always bring serious flooding from intense rain and storm surges. Some recent examples are New Orleans in 2005 with Hurricane Katrina, and New Jersey and New York in 2012 with Hurricane Sandy (Figure 19.14).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1250" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Damage-to-the-Casino-Pier.jpg"><img width="400" height="225" class="wp-image-1250" alt="Figure 19.14 Damage to the Casino Pier, Seaside Heights, New Jersey, from Hurricane Sandy, November 2012 [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Hurricane_Sandy_New_Jersey_Pier.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Damage-to-the-Casino-Pier-1024x575.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1250">Figure 19.14 Damage to the Casino Pier, Seaside Heights, New Jersey, from Hurricane Sandy, November 2012 [https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/Hurricane_Sandy_New_Jersey_Pier.jpg]</div></div> <p>Tropical storms get their energy from the evaporation of warm seawater in tropical regions.

Not only has the overall intensity of Atlantic hurricanes increased with the warming since 1975, but the correlation between hurricanes and sea-surface temperatures is very strong over that time period.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1251" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1251" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Relationship-between-Atlantic-tropical-storm-cumulative-annual-intensity-and-Atlantic-sea-surface-temperatures.png"><img width="400" height="256" class="wp-image-1251" alt="Figure 19.15 Relationship between Atlantic tropical storm cumulative annual intensity and Atlantic sea-surface temperatures [By SE from data at: http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/Papers_data_graphics.htm]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Relationship-between-Atlantic-tropical-storm-cumulative-annual-intensity-and-Atlantic-sea-surface-temperatures-1024x657.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1251">Figure 19.15 Relationship between Atlantic tropical storm cumulative annual intensity and Atlantic sea-surface temperatures [By SE from data at: http://wind.mit.edu/~emanuel/Papers_data_graphics.htm]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Because warm air is able to hold more water than cold air, the general global trend over the past century has been one of increasing precipitation (Figure 19.16).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1071" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/precipitation-2.png"><img width="300" height="107" class="size-medium wp-image-1071" alt="Figure 19.16 Global precipitation anomalies compared with the average over the period from 1901 to 2000 [By NASA, from: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/precipitation.html]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/precipitation-2-300x107.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 19.16 Global precipitation anomalies compared with the average over the period from 1901 to 2000 [By NASA, from: http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/science/indicators/weather-climate/precipitation.html]</div></div> <p>A similar trend is evident for British Columbia, based on weather data from 1945 to 2005 for 29 stations distributed around the province (Figure 19.17).

This includes water, of course, our most important resource, but it also includes all the other materials that we need to construct things like roads, dams, and bridges, or manufacture things like plates, toasters, and telephones. Even most of our energy resources come from Earth, including uranium and fossil fuels, and much of the infrastructure of this electrical age depends on copper (Figure 20.1).</p> <p>Virtually everything we use every day is made from resources from Earth. For example, let’s look at a tablet computer (Figure 20.2). Most of the case is made of a plastic known as ABS, which is made from either gas or petroleum. Some tablets have a case made from aluminum. The glass of a touch screen is made mostly from quartz combined with smaller amounts of sodium oxide (Na2O), sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and calcium oxide (CaO). To make it work as a touch screen, the upper surface is coated with indium tin oxide. When you touch the screen you’re actually pushing a thin layer of polycarbonate plastic (made from petroleum) against the coated glass — completing an electrical circuit. The computer is then able to figure out exactly where you touched the screen. Computer processors are made from silica wafers (more quartz) and also include a significant amount of copper and gold. Gold is used because it is a better conductor than copper and doesn’t tarnish the way silver or copper does. Most computers have nickel-metal-hydride (NiMH) batteries, which contain nickel, of course, along with cadmium, cobalt, manganese, aluminum, and the rare-earth elements lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, and praseodymium. The processor and other electronic components are secured to a circuit board, which is a thin layer of fibreglass sandwiched between copper sheets coated with small amounts of tin and lead. Various parts are put together with steel screws that are made of iron and molybdenum.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1193" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/main-components-of-a-tablet-computer.png"><img class="wp-image-1193" alt="Figure 20.2 The main components of a tablet computer [SE, base photograph from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/IPad_Air.png]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/main-components-of-a-tablet-computer.png" width="400" height="265" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1193">Figure 20.2 The main components of a tablet computer [SE, base photograph from https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/8d/IPad_Air.png]</div></div> <p>That’s not everything that goes into a tablet computer, but to make just those components we need a pure-silica sand deposit, a salt mine for sodium, a rock quarry for calcium, an oil well, a gas well, an aluminum mine, an iron mine, a manganese mine, a copper-molybdenum-gold mine, a cobalt-nickel mine, a rare-earth element and indium mine, and a source of energy to transport all of the materials, process them, put them together, and finally transport the computer to your house or the store where you bought it.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 20.1 Where Does It Come From? </strong></p> <p>Look around you and find at least five objects (other than a computer or a phone) that have been made from materials that had to be mined, quarried, or extracted from an oil or gas well.

Canada has some of the largest mining districts and deposits in the world, and for the past 150 years, we have been one of the most important suppliers of metals. Extraction of Earth’s resources goes back a long way in Canada. For example, the First Nations of British Columbia extracted obsidian from volcanic regions for tools and traded it up and down the coast. In the 1850s, gold was discovered in central British Columbia, and in the 1890s, even more gold was discovered in the Klondike area of Yukon. These two events were critical to the early development of British Columbia, Yukon, and Alaska.</p> <p>Canada’s mining sector had revenues in the order of $37 billion in 2013. The majority of that was split roughly equally among gold, iron, copper, and potash, with important but lesser amounts from nickel and diamonds (Figure 20.3). Revenues from the petroleum sector are significantly higher, at over $100 billion per year.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1195" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/value-of-various-Canadian-mining-sectors-in-2013.png"><img width="400" height="242" class="wp-image-1195" alt="Figure 20.3 The value of various Canadian mining sectors in 2013 [SE from data at http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mining-materials/publications/8772]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/value-of-various-Canadian-mining-sectors-in-2013.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1195">Figure 20.3 The value of various Canadian mining sectors in 2013 [SE from data at http://www.nrcan.gc.ca/mining-materials/publications/8772]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>A metal deposit is a body of rock in which one or more metals have been concentrated to the point of being economically viable for recovery. Some <strong>background</strong> levels of important metals in average rocks are shown on Table 20.1, along with the typical grades necessary to make a viable deposit, and the corresponding concentration factors. Looking at copper, for example, we can see that while average rock has around 40 ppm (parts per million) of copper, a grade of around 10,000 ppm or 1% is necessary to make a viable copper deposit. In other words, copper ore has about 250 times as much copper as typical rock. For the other elements in the list, the concentration factors are much higher. For gold, it’s 2,000 times and for silver it’s around 10,000 times.</p> <table><caption>Table 20.1 Typical background and ore levels of some important metals [SE]</caption> <tbody><tr><th><strong>Metal</strong></th> <th><strong>Typical Background Level</strong></th> <th><strong>Typical Economic Grade*</strong></th> <th><strong>Concentration Factor</strong></th> </tr> <tr><td>Copper</td> <td>40 ppm</td> <td>10,000 ppm (1%)</td> <td>250 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Gold</td> <td>0.003 ppm</td> <td>6 ppm (0.006%)</td> <td>2,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Lead</td> <td>10 ppm</td> <td>50,000 ppm (5%</td> <td>5,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Molybdenum</td> <td>1 ppm</td> <td>1,000 ppm (0.1%)</td> <td>1,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Nickel</td> <td>25 ppm</td> <td>20,000 ppm (2%)</td> <td>800 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Silver</td> <td>0.1 ppm</td> <td>1,000 ppm (0.1%)</td> <td>10,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Uranium</td> <td>2 ppm</td> <td>10,000 ppm (1%)</td> <td>5,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td>Zinc</td> <td>50 ppm</td> <td>50,000 ppm (5%)</td> <td>1,000 times</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="4"></td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="4">*It’s important to note that the economic viability of any deposit depends on a wide range of factors including its grade, size, shape, depth below the surface, and proximity to infrastructure, the current price of the metal, the labour and environmental regulations in the area, and many other factors.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>It is clear that some very significant concentration must take place to form a mineable deposit. This concentration may occur during the formation of the host rock, or after the rock forms, through a number of different types of processes. There is a very wide variety of ore-forming processes, and there are hundreds of types of mineral deposits. The origins of a few of them are described below.</p> <h1><strong>Magmatic Nickel Deposits </strong></h1> <p>A magmatic deposit is one in which the metal concentration takes place primarily at the same time as the formation and emplacement of the magma. Most of the nickel mined in Canada comes from magmatic deposits such as those in Sudbury (Ontario), Thompson (Manitoba) (Figure 20.4), and Voisey’s Bay (Labrador). The magmas from which these deposits form are of mafic or ultramafic composition (derived from the mantle), and therefore they have relatively high nickel and copper contents to begin with (as much as 100 times more than normal rocks in the case of nickel). These elements may be further concentrated within the magma as a result of the addition of sulphur from partial melting of the surrounding rocks. The heavy nickel and copper sulphide minerals are then concentrated further still by gravity segregation (i.e., crystals settling toward the bottom of the magma chamber). In some cases, there are significant concentrations of platinum-bearing minerals.</p> <p>Most of these types of deposits around the world are Precambrian in age — probably because the mantle was significantly hotter at that time, and the necessary mafic and ultramafic magmas were more likely to be emplaced in the continental crust.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1196" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/nickel-smelter-at-Thompson.jpg"><img width="400" height="214" class="wp-image-1196" alt="Figure 20.4 The nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson,_Manitoba#/media/File:Vale_Nickel_Mine.JPG]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/nickel-smelter-at-Thompson-1024x547.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1196">Figure 20.4 The nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thompson,_Manitoba#/media/File:Vale_Nickel_Mine.JPG]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <h1><strong>Volcanogenic Massive Sulphide Deposits </strong></h1> <p>Much of the copper, zinc, lead, silver, and gold mined in Canada is mined from <strong>volcanic</strong>&#8211;<strong>hosted</strong> <strong>massive sulphide (VHMS)</strong> deposits associated with submarine volcanism (VMS deposits). Examples are the deposits at Kidd Creek, Ontario, Flin Flon on the Manitoba-Saskatchewan border, Britannia on Howe Sound, and Myra Falls (within Strathcona Park) on Vancouver Island.</p> <p>VMS deposits are formed from the water discharged at high temperature (250° to 300°C) at ocean-floor hydrothermal vents, primarily in areas of subduction-zone volcanism. The environment is comparable to that of modern-day black smokers (Figure 20.5), which form where hot metal- and sulphide-rich water issues from the sea floor. They are called massive sulphide deposits because the sulphide minerals (including pyrite (FeS2) , sphalerite (ZnS), chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), and galena (PbS)) are generally present in very high concentrations (making up the majority of the rock in some cases). The metals and the sulphur are leached out of the sea-floor rocks by convecting groundwater driven by the volcanic heat, and then quickly precipitated where that hot water enters the cold seawater, causing it to cool suddenly and change chemically. The volcanic rock that hosts the deposits is formed in the same area and at the same general time as the accumulation of the ore minerals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1081" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1081" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/black-smoker-2.png"><img width="300" height="173" class="size-medium wp-image-1081" alt="Figure 20.5 Left: A black smoker on the Juan de Fuca Ridge off the west coast of Vancouver Island.

Most porphyry deposits also host some gold, which may be, in rare cases, the primary commodity. B.C. examples include several large deposits within the Highland Valley mine (Figure 20.1) and numerous other deposits scattered around the central part of the province.</p> <p>A porphyry deposit forms around a cooling felsicstock in the upper part of the crust. They are called “porphyry” because upper crustal stocks are typically porphyritic in texture, the result of a two-stage cooling process. Metal enrichment results in part from convection of groundwater related to the heat of the stock, and also from metal-rich hot water expelled by the cooling magma (Figure 20.6). The host rocks, which commonly include the stock itself and the surrounding country rocks, are normally highly fractured and brecciated. During the ore-forming process, some of the original minerals in these rocks are altered to potassium feldspar, biotite, epidote, and various clay minerals. The important ore minerals include chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), bornite (Cu<sub>5</sub>FeS<sub>4</sub>), and pyrite in copper porphyry deposits, or molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>) and pyrite in molybdenum porphyry deposits. Gold is present as minute flakes of native gold.</p> <p>This type of environment (i.e., around and above an intrusive body) is also favourable for the formation of other types of deposits — particularly vein-type gold deposits (a.k.a. <strong>epithermal deposits</strong>). Some of the gold deposits of British Columbia (such as in the Eskay Creek area adjacent to the Alaska panhandle), and many of the other gold deposits situated along the western edge of both South and North America are of the vein type shown in Figure 20.6, and are related to nearby magma bodies.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1198" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1198" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/the-formation-of-a-porphyry-deposit.png"><img width="400" height="336" class="wp-image-1198" alt="Figure 20.6 A model for the formation of a porphyry deposit around an upper-crustal porphyritic stock and associated vein deposits.

At that time, iron that was present in dissolved form in the ocean (as Fe2+) became oxidized to its insoluble form (Fe3+) and accumulated on the sea floor, mostly as hematite interbedded with chert (Figure 20.7). Unlike many other metals, which are economically viable at grades of around 1% or even much less, iron deposits are only viable if the grades are in the order of 50% iron and if they are very large.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1199" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Banded-iron-formation.jpg"><img width="400" height="295" class="wp-image-1199" alt="Figure 20.7 Banded iron formation from an unknown location in North America on display at a museum in Germany.

These are called <strong>unconformity-type</strong> <strong>uranium deposits</strong> because they are all situated very close to the unconformity between the Proterozoic Athabasca Group sandstone and the much older Archean sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive igneous rock (Figure 20.8). The origin of unconformity-type U deposits is not perfectly understood, but it is thought that two particular features are important: (1) the relative permeability of the Athabasca Group sandstone, and (2) the presence of graphitic schist within the underlying Archean rocks. The permeability of the sandstone allowed groundwater to flow through it and leach out small amounts of U, which stayed in solution in the oxidized form U6<sup>+</sup>. The graphite (C) created a reducing environment (non-oxidizing) that converted the U from U6<sup>+</sup> to insoluble U4<sup>+</sup>, at which point it was precipitated as the mineral uraninite (UO<sub>2</sub>).</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 20.2 The importance of Heat and Heat Engines </strong></p> <p>For a variety of reasons, thermal energy (heat) from within Earth is critical in the formation of many types of ore deposits.

Creating a giant hole in the ground is generally cheaper than making an underground mine, but it is also less precise, so it is necessary to mine a lot of waste rock along with the ore. Relatively deep deposits or those with elongated or irregular shapes are typically mined from underground with deep vertical <strong>shafts</strong>, <strong>declines</strong> (sloped tunnels), and <strong>levels</strong> (horizontal tunnels) (Figures 20.09 and 20.11). In this way, it is possible to focus the mining on the ore body itself.

Other sulphide minerals are commonly present within the ore, especially pyrite.</p> <p>When ore is processed (typically very close to the mine), it is ground to a fine powder and the ore minerals are physically separated from the rest of the rock to make a <strong>concentrate</strong>. At a molybdenum mine, for example, this concentrate may be almost pure molybdenite (MoS<sub>2</sub>). The rest of the rock is known as <strong>tailings</strong>. It comes out of the concentrator as a wet slurry and must be stored near the mine, in most cases, in a tailings pond.</p> <p>The tailings pond at the Myra Falls Mine on Vancouver Island is shown in Figure 20.12, and the settling ponds for waste water from the concentrator are shown in Figure 20.13. The tailings are contained by an embankment. Also visible in the foreground of Figure 20.12 is a pile of waste rock, which is non-ore rock that was mined in order to access the ore. Although this waste rock contains little or no ore minerals, at many mines it contains up to a few percent pyrite. The tailings and the waste rock at most mines are an environmental liability because they contain pyrite plus small amounts of ore minerals. When pyrite is exposed to oxygen and water, it generates sulphuric acid — also known as <strong>acid rock drainage</strong> (ARD). Acidity itself is a problem to the environment, but because the ore elements, such as copper or lead, are more soluble in acidic water than neutral water, ARD is also typically quite rich in metals, many of which are toxic.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1204" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/tailings-pond-at-the-Myra-Falls-Mine.jpg"><img width="400" height="181" class="wp-image-1204" alt="Figure 20.12 The tailings pond at the Myra Falls Mine on Vancouver Island.

But separation of ore minerals is only the preliminary stage of metal refinement, for most metals the second stage involves separating the actual elements within the ore minerals. For example, the most common ore of copper is chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>). The copper needs to be separated from the iron and sulphur to make copper metal and that involves complicated and very energy-intensive processes that are done at <strong>smelters</strong> or other types of refineries. Because of their cost and the economies of scale, there are far fewer refineries than there are mines.</p> <p>There are several metal refineries (including smelters) in Canada; some examples are the aluminum refinery in Kitimat, B.C. (which uses ore from overseas); the lead-zinc smelter in Trail, B.C.; the nickel smelter at Thompson, Manitoba; numerous steel smelters in Ontario, along with several other refining operations for nickel, copper, zinc, and uranium; aluminum refineries in Quebec; and a lead smelter in New Brunswick.</p> </div></div>

The largest salt mine in the world is at Goderich, Ontario, where salt is recovered from the 100 m thick Silurian Salina Formation. The same formation is mined in the Windsor area. Rock salt is also used as a source of sodium and chlorine in the chemical industry to melt ice on roads, as part of the process of softening water, and as a seasoning. Under certain conditions, the mineral sylvite (KCl) accumulates in evaporite beds, and this rock is called potash. This happened across the Canadian prairies during the Devonian, creating the Prairie evaporite formation (Figure 6.16). Potassium is used as a crop fertilizer, and Canada is the world’s leading supplier, with most of that production coming from Saskatchewan.</p> <p>Another evaporite mineral, gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>0), is the main component of plasterboard (drywall) that is widely used in the construction industry.

Fossil fuels are rich in carbon and almost all of that carbon ultimately originates from CO<sub>2</sub> taken out of the atmosphere during photosynthesis. That process, driven by solar energy, involves reduction (the opposite of oxidation) of the carbon, resulting in it being combined with hydrogen instead of oxygen. The resulting organic matter is made up of complex and varied carbohydrate molecules.</p> <p>Most organic matter is oxidized back to CO<sub>2</sub> relatively quickly (within weeks or years in most cases), but any of it that gets isolated from the oxygen of the atmosphere (for example, deep in the ocean or in a stagnant bog) may last long enough to be buried by sediments and, if so, may be preserved for tens to hundreds of millions of years. Under natural conditions, that means it will be stored until those rocks are eventually exposed at the surface and weathered.</p> <p>In this section, we’ll discuss the origins and extraction of the important fossils fuels, including coal, oil, and gas. Coal, the first fossil fuel to be widely used, forms mostly on land in swampy areas adjacent to rivers and deltas in areas with humid tropical to temperate climates. The vigorous growth of vegetation leads to an abundance of organic matter that accumulates within stagnant water, and thus does not decay and oxidize. This situation, where the dead organic matter is submerged in oxygen-poor water, must be maintained for centuries to millennia in order for enough material to accumulate to form a thick layer (Figure 20.18a). At some point, the swamp deposit is covered with more sediment — typically because a river changes its course or sea level rises (Figure 20.18b). As more sediments are added, the organic matter starts to become compressed and heated. Low-grade <strong>lignite</strong> coal forms at depths between a few 100 m and 1,500 m and temperatures up to about 50°C (Figure 20.18c). At between 1,000 m to 5,000 m depth and temperatures up to 150°C m, <strong>bituminous</strong> coal forms (Figure 20.18d). At depths beyond 5,000 m and temperatures over 150°C, <strong>anthracite</strong> coal forms.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1082" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1082" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/06/coal-2.png"><img width="300" height="157" class="size-medium wp-image-1082" alt="Figure 20.18 Formation of coal: (a) accumulation of organic matter within a swampy area; (b) the organic matter is covered and compressed by deposition of a new layer of clastic sediments; (c) with greater burial, lignite coal forms; and (d) at even greater depths, bituminous and eventually anthracite coal form.

In Alberta and Saskatchewan, much of the coal is used for electricity generation. Coal from the Highvale Mine (Figure 20.19), Canada’s largest, is used to feed the Sundance and Keephills power stations west of Edmonton. Almost all of the coal mined in British Columbia is exported for use in manufacturing steel.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1212" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Highvale-Mine-and-the-Sundance.jpg"><img width="400" height="188" class="wp-image-1212" alt="Figure 20.19 The Highvale Mine (background) and the Sundance (right) and Keephills (left) generating stations on the southern shore of Wabamun Lake, Alberta [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Highvale-Mine-and-the-Sundance.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1212">Figure 20.19 The Highvale Mine (background) and the Sundance (right) and Keephills (left) generating stations on the southern shore of Wabamun Lake, Alberta [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>While almost all coal forms on land from terrestrial vegetation, most oil and gas is derived primarily from marine micro-organisms that accumulate within sea-floor sediments. In areas where marine productivity is high, dead organic matter is delivered to the sea floor fast enough that some of it escapes oxidation. This material accumulates in the muddy sediments, which become buried to significant depth beneath other sediments.</p> <p>As the depth of burial increases, so does the temperature — due to the geothermal gradient — and gradually the organic matter within the sediments is converted to hydrocarbons (Figure 20.20). The first stage is the biological production (involving anaerobic bacteria) of methane. Most of this escapes back to the surface, but some is trapped in methane hydrates near the sea floor. At depths beyond about 2 km, and at temperatures ranging from 60° to 120°C, the organic matter is converted by chemical processes to oil. This depth and temperature range is known as the <strong>oil window</strong>. Beyond 120°C most of the organic matter is chemically converted to methane.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1213" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/depth-and-temperature-limits-for-biogenic-gas.png"><img width="400" height="301" class="wp-image-1213" alt="Figure 20.20 The depth and temperature limits for biogenic gas, oil, and thermogenic gas [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/depth-and-temperature-limits-for-biogenic-gas.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1213">Figure 20.20 The depth and temperature limits for biogenic gas, oil, and thermogenic gas [SE]</div></div> <p>The organic matter-bearing rock within which the formation of gas and oil takes place is known to petroleum geologists as the <strong>source rock</strong>. Both liquid oil and gaseous methane are lighter than water, so as liquids and gases form, they tend to move slowly toward the surface, out of the source rock and into <strong>reservoir rocks</strong>. Reservoir rocks are typically relatively permeable because that allows migration of the fluids from the source rocks, and also facilitates recovery of the oil or gas. In some cases, the liquids and gases make it all the way to the surface, where they are oxidized, and the carbon is returned to the atmosphere. But in other cases, they are contained by overlying impermeable rocks (e.g., mudrock) in situations where anticlines, faults, stratigraphy changes, and reefs or salt domes create traps (Figure 20.21).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1214" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Migration-of-oil-and-gas.png"><img width="400" height="213" class="wp-image-1214" alt="Figure 20.21 Migration of oil and gas from source rocks into traps in reservoir rocks [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Migration-of-oil-and-gas.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1214">Figure 20.21 Migration of oil and gas from source rocks into traps in reservoir rocks [SE]</div></div> <p>The liquids and gases that are trapped within reservoirs become separated into layers based on their density, with gas rising to the top, oil below it, and water underneath the oil.

Seismic surveys are the most commonly used tool for early-stage petroleum exploration, as they can reveal important information about the stratigraphy and structural geology of subsurface sedimentary rocks. An example from the Gulf of Mexico south of Texas is shown in Figure 20.22. In this area, a thick evaporite deposit (“salt”) has formed domes because salt is lighter than other sediments and tends to rise slowly toward the surface; this has created traps. The sequence of deformed rocks is capped with a layer of undeformed rock.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>Exercise 20.4 Interpreting a Seismic Profile </strong></p> <p>The cross-section shown here is from a ship-borne seismic survey in the Bering Sea off the west coast of Alaska.

Some unconventional types of oil and gas include oil sands, shale gas, and coal-bed methane.</p> <p>Oil sands are important because the reserves in Alberta are so large (the largest single reserve of oil in the world), but they are very controversial from an environmental and social perspective. They are “unconventional” because the oil is exposed near the surface and is highly viscous because of microbial changes that have taken place at the surface. The hydrocarbons that form this reserve originated in deeply buried Paleozoic rocks adjacent to the Rocky Mountains and migrated up and toward the east (Figure 20.23).</p> <p>The oil sands are controversial primarily because of the environmental cost of their extraction. Since the oil is so viscous, it requires heat to make it sufficiently liquid to process. This energy comes from gas; approximately 25 m3 of gas is used to produce 0.16 m3 (one barrel) of oil. (That’s not quite as bad as it sounds, as the energy equivalent of the required gas is about 20% of the energy embodied in the produced oil.) The other environmental cost of oil sands production is the devastation of vast areas of land where strip-mining is taking place and tailings ponds are constructed, and the unavoidable release of contaminants into the groundwater and rivers of the region.</p> <p>At present, most oil recovery from oil sands is achieved by mining the sand and processing it on site. Exploitation of oil sand that is not exposed at the surface depends on in situ processes, an example being the injection of steam into the oil-sand layer to reduce the viscosity of the oil so that it can be pumped to the surface.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1217" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Schematic-cross-section-of-northern-Alberta.png"><img width="400" height="184" class="wp-image-1217" alt="Figure 20.23 Schematic cross-section of northern Alberta showing the source rocks and location of the Athabasca Oil Sands [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Schematic-cross-section-of-northern-Alberta-1024x470.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1217">Figure 20.23 Schematic cross-section of northern Alberta showing the source rocks and location of the Athabasca Oil Sands [SE]</div></div> <p>Shale gas is gas that is trapped within rock that is too impermeable for the gas to escape under normal conditions, and it can only be extracted by fracturing the reservoir rock using water and chemicals under extremely high pressure. This procedure is known as <strong>hydraulic fracturing</strong> or “<strong>fracking.</strong>” Fracking is controversial because of the volume of water used, and because, in some jurisdictions, the fracking companies are not required to disclose the nature of the chemicals used. Although fracking is typically done at significant depths, there is always the risk that overlying water-supply aquifers could be contaminated (Figure 20.24). Fracking also induces low-level seismicity.</p> <p>During the process that converts organic matter to coal, some methane is produced, which is stored within the pores of the coal. When coal is mined, methane is released into the mine where it can become a serious explosion hazard. Modern coal-mining machines have methane detectors on them and actually stop operating if the methane levels are dangerous. It is possible to extract the methane from coal beds without mining the coal; gas recovered this way is known as <strong>coal-bed methane</strong>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1218" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1218" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Depiction-of-the-process-of-directional-drilling-and-fracking.png"><img width="400" height="169" class="wp-image-1218" alt="Figure 20.24 Depiction of the process of directional drilling and fracking to recover gas from impermeable rocks.

Diamonds form deep in the mantle (approximately 200 km to 250 km depth) under very specific pressure and temperature conditions, from carbon that is naturally present in mantle rock (not from coal). The diamond-bearing rock is brought to the surface coincidentally via a type of volcanism that is extremely rare (the most recent kimberlite eruption is thought to have taken place 10,000 years ago and prior to that at around 30 Ma). There is more on the volcanology of kimberlites in section 4.3. All of the world’s kimberlite diamond deposits are situated within ancient shield areas (<strong>cratons</strong>) in Africa, Australia, Russia, South America, and North America.</p> <p>It has long been known that diamonds could exist within the Canadian Shield, but up until 1991, exploration efforts had been unsuccessful. In 1980 two geologists, Chuck Fipke and Stu Blusson, started searching in the Northwest Territories by sampling glacial sediments looking for some of the minerals that are normally quite abundant within <strong>kimberlites</strong>: chromium-bearing garnet, chromium-bearing pyroxene, chromite (Cr<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub>), and ilmenite (FeTiO<sub>3</sub>). These distinctive minerals are used for this type of exploration because they are many times more abundant in kimberlite than diamond is. After more than a decade of exploration, Fipke and Blusson finally focused their search on an area 250 km northeast of Yellowknife, and, in 1991, they announced the discovery of a diamond-bearing kimberlite body at Lac de Gras. That discovery is now the Diavik Mine, and there is another diamond mine — Ekati — 25 km to the northwest (Figure 20.25). There are two separate mines at Diavik accessing three different kimberlite bodies, and there are five at Ekati. See Figure 4.22 for a close-up view of the Ekati Mine. There are six operating diamond mines in Canada, four in the Northwest Territories (including Diavik and Ekati), and one each in Nunavut and Ontario.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1219" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Diamond-mines-in-the-Lac-de-Gras-region.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1219" alt="Figure 20.25 Diamond mines in the Lac de Gras region, Nunavut.

Gold, iron, copper, nickel, and potash are Canada’s most valuable mined commodities. The proportions of metals in mineral deposits are typically several thousand times higher than those in average rocks, and special processes are required to extract the valuable content. Some deposits form through processes within a magma chamber, others during volcanism or adjacent to a stock, and some are related to sedimentary processes. Mining involves both surface and underground methods, but in either case, rock is brought to surface that can react with water and oxygen to produce acid rock drainage and metal contamination.</td> </tr> <tr><th>20.2</th> <th>Industrial Minerals</th> <td>Non-metallic materials are very important to infrastructure and agriculture. Some of the major industrial minerals include sand and gravel, limestone for cement and agriculture, salt for a range of applications, potash fertilizer, and decorative stone.</td> </tr> <tr><th>20.3</th> <th>Fossil Fuels</th> <td>The main fossil fuels are coal, oil, and gas. Coal forms on land in wet environments where organic matter can remain submerged and isolated from oxygen for millennia before it is buried by more sediments. The depth of that burial influences the grade of coal produced. Oil and gas originate from organisms living in marine environments, and again, fairly rapid burial is required to preserve the organic matter on the sea floor. At moderate burial depth (2 km to 4 km), oil is produced, and at greater depth, gas is produced. Both oil and gas migrate toward the surface and can be trapped beneath impermeable rock layers in structural features, such as anticlines or faults. Some unconventional fossil fuel resources include oil sands, shale gas, and coal-bed methane.</td> </tr> <tr><th>20.4</th> <th>Diamonds</th> <td>Diamonds originate in the mantle and are only brought to the surface by the very rare eruption of kimberlitic volcanoes. The relatively recent discovery of diamonds in Canada was based on the exhaustive search for diamond indicator minerals in glacial sediments. There are now six diamond mines in Canada.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

During that time, it collided several times with other continents and was temporarily part of two supercontinents (Pannotia and Pangea).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1377" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/The-path-of-Laurentia.png"><img class="wp-image-1377" alt="Figure 21.2 The path of Laurentia over the past 650 Ma [SE]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/The-path-of-Laurentia-1024x519.png" height="203" width="400" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1377">Figure 21.2 The path of Laurentia over the past 650 Ma [SE]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Bodies of rock tend to be eroded and recycled through the processes of plate tectonics, including uplift leading to erosion and burial leading to melting, and thus there are very few areas of truly ancient rocks on Earth. The oldest undisputed rocks are those of the Acasta Gneiss from north of Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, aged 4.03 Ga. But there are some rocks that could be even older within the Nuvvuagittuq greenstone belt on the east coast of Hudson Bay, in Quebec. These have been isotopically dated at 4.28 Ga, although the reliability of that date has been questioned. Based on other data, it is acknowledged that the Nuvvuagittuq rocks are at least as old as 3.75 Ga. The Acasta and Nuvvuagittuq rocks are situated within the Slave and Superior Cratons respectively, the oldest parts of Laurentia (Figure 21.3). Although these ancient cratons are not consistently that old, they are generally older than 3 Ga, as is part of the Wyoming Craton. The Hearne and Rae Cratons are older than 2 Ga, while most of the other parts of Laurentia are aged between 1 Ga and 2 Ga. The various provinces of Laurentia were assembled by plate-tectonic processes between 1 Ga and 3 Ga.</p> <p>The areas of Figure 21.3 that are left uncoloured — the Appalachian, Innuitian, and Cordilleran fold belts — are geological regions that have been added to North America since 500 Ma. These are at least partly made up of sedimentary rocks that were deposited along the coasts and then folded, faulted, and uplifted during continental collisions.</p> <p>The term <em>Laurentia </em>is geologically equivalent to the term <strong>Canadian Shield</strong>, although the latter is generally considered to be the area where the ancient Laurentian rocks are exposed at the surface and not covered with younger rocks. That applies to most of the region to the north and east of the red dotted line in Figure 21.3.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1378" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/main-provinces-of-Laurentia.png"><img class="wp-image-1378" alt="Figure 21.3 The main provinces of Laurentia.

As Rodinia started to break up after 700 Ma, sediments derived from the erosion of the interior of the continent began to accumulate along its coasts, initially along the west coast, then the east coast at around 600 Ma, and finally on the north coast by around 550 Ma. This process continued for several hundred million years. By around 450 Ma, large areas of the interior of Laurentia were depressed below sea level — probably because of the downward pull of an underlying subducting plate — and marine sediments were deposited over parts of Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and the Northwest Territories during the Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian Periods (450 Ma to 350 Ma). These sediments are coloured various shades of blue on the geological map of Canada (Figure 21.4).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1395" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1395" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Geological-map-of-Canada.png"><img class="wp-image-1395" alt="Figure 21.4 Geological map of Canada from the Geological Survey of Canada [http://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&amp;search1=R=208175]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Geological-map-of-Canada-1024x825.png" height="242" width="300" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1395">Figure 21.4 Geological map of Canada from the Geological Survey of Canada [http://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&amp;search1=R=208175]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>At approximately 350 Ma, the part of Gondwana that is now Africa collided with the eastern coast of North America, thrusting volcanic islands and sedimentary layers far inland to become the Appalachian fold belt.

(Figure 21.3), but the ancient rocks of the craton are almost completely covered by younger rocks in B.C., Yukon, and all of Alberta except the far northeast corner. Laurentia is well represented in northern Saskatchewan and across large parts of Manitoba, the Northwest Territories, and Nunavut (Figure 21.5). Where they are exposed, the rocks of the Canadian Shield are highly varied lithologically, typically strongly metamorphosed due to their deep burial at some time in the past, and in some cases, quite different from what could be expected to occur on Earth today.</p> <p>Starting from the south, in eastern Manitoba and adjacent Ontario, we have the ancient rocks of the Superior Province. On the map the Superior Province, rocks are mostly pink, representing granitic and gneissic rocks, with strips and blotches of green, representing metamorphosed sea-floor basalt and sediments, also known as greenstone belts. These rocks are widely interpreted to have deep crustal origins, and include large areas of granulite facies metamorphic rock formed at high temperatures and moderate to high pressures (see Figure 7.19). Superior Province greenstone belts in Ontario and Quebec host some of the world’s largest volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits. As described in Chapter 20, the Superior Province in northern Manitoba is host to important nickel deposits at Thompson. These formed from mantle-derived mafic magma that interacted with sulphur-bearing crustal rocks, and within which heavy-metal sulphide minerals formed.</p> <p>The Trans-Hudson Orogen (THO), as its name implies, extends through Saskatchewan and Manitoba and over to the eastern side of Hudson Bay. It represents the continent-continent collision zone between the Superior Craton to the south and the Churchill Craton (including the Wyoming, Hearne, and Rae Cratons) to the north; thus it’s a remnant of the initial formation of Laurentia at around 1.9 Ga. At the time of the collision, the THO would have been a major mountain range, and the rocks that we see there now — which evolved deep beneath those mountains — are highly metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks intruded by large granitic bodies. The important volcanogenic massive sulphide deposits around Flin Flon are within the THO.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1383" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1383" style="width: 241px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Canadian-Shield-of-western-Canada.png"><img width="241" height="300" class="wp-image-1383" alt="Figure 21.5 Geological features of the Canadian Shield of western Canada.

It includes two important sedimentary basins: the Athabasca Basin in Saskatchewan and the Thelon Basin in Nunavut, both filled with rocks aged around 1.7 Ga. These consist primarily of sandstones and minor mudstones that are only weakly metamorphosed and essentially undeformed (not folded) because they are situated within a stable craton and so have not been subjected to significant tectonic forces. The Athabasca Basin is economically important for its large and rich unconformity-type uranium deposits (see Chapter 20). At its western end, there is the remnant of a large extraterrestrial impact, the 40 km diameter Carswell Crater. When the meteor struck at this location, at around 115 Ma, the impact and subsequent rebound of the crust was enough to bring metamorphic rock up to surface from beneath about 2,000 m of Athabasca Group sandstone. There is no connection between the Carswell Crater and the much older (~1.2 Ga) uranium deposits.</p> <p>The Taltson Magmatic Zone (TMZ), which forms the boundary between the Churchill and Slave Cratons, consists primarily of granitic rock. One interpretation is that the TMZ formed along a convergent boundary, although this is not universally accepted.</p> <p>The Slave Craton is dominated by granitic rocks and metamorphosed clastic sedimentary rocks. On its western edge, there is a large area of very old gneissic rock that includes the Acasta Gneiss, dated at 4.03 Ga, which, for the time being at least, is the oldest rock in the world (Figure 21.6).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1379" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1379" style="width: 269px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Acasta-Gneiss.jpg"><img width="269" height="300" class="wp-image-1379" alt="Figure 21.6 A sample of the Acasta Gneiss on display at the Natural History Museum in Vienna [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acasta_gneiss.jpg]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Acasta-Gneiss.jpg" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1379">Figure 21.6 A sample of the Acasta Gneiss on display at the Natural History Museum in Vienna [https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acasta_gneiss.jpg]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>The Wopmay Orogen, interpreted as the site of another ancient continent-continent collision, lies to the west of the Slave Craton. Although mostly composed of felsic igneous rocks and gneisses, the Wopmay Orogen includes a body of mafic and ultramafic igneous rock called the Muskox Intrusion. Derived from a mantle plume and dated at about 1.1 Ga, the Muskox is comparable to a handful of other mafic and ultramafic intrusions around the world in that it has distinctive repetitive layering caused by settling of heavy metal-rich minerals within the low-viscosity magma. Muskox has high levels of nickel, copper, and chromium, and has the potential to have platinum and palladium like a similar body in South Africa. Ultramafic intrusions like Muskox do not take place on Earth today because the mantle is no longer hot enough.</p> <p>The oldest rocks in British Columbia are the strongly metamorphosed sedimentary, volcanic, and intrusive rocks of the Monashee Complex, situated to the west of the Columbia River near Revelstoke (Figure 21.7). Aged around 2 Ga, these may actually be part of Laurentia.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1407" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1407" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Precambrian_rocks_in_southern-BC.png"><img width="260" height="300" class="wp-image-1407" alt="Figure 21.7 Precambrian rocks in southern B.C. and Alberta [ By SE after: http://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&amp;search1=R=208175]" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/Precambrian_rocks_in_southern-BC.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1407">Figure 21.7 Precambrian rocks in southern B.C. and Alberta [ By SE after: http://geoscan.nrcan.gc.ca/starweb/geoscan/servlet.starweb?path=geoscan/fulle.web&amp;search1=R=208175]</div></div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>There are much more extensive Precambrian rocks within the Columbia and Rocky Mountains of southeastern B.C. and the southwestern corner of Alberta.

These are mostly unmetamorphosed clastic rocks deposited in rivers and lakes during the middle Proterozoic, at around 1,400 Ma, while Laurentia was still part of the supercontinent Columbia. When Columbia rifted apart, the division happened within the area of the Purcell/Belt rocks.

Deposition in this area was taking place during the late Proterozoic Snowball Earth glaciations, as can be seen in Windermere Group rocks of the Toby Formation from the area south of Cranbrook, B.C. (Figure 21.8). The Toby Formation is a fine-grained marine rock (mudstone) with numerous large angular clasts of limestone and quartz. The mud was deposited in the quiet water of a continental slope environment, and the large clasts were dropped from floating ice derived from glaciers on Laurentia. The Toby Formation is unique in this area; most of the rest of the late Proterozoic clastic sedimentary rocks in this region do not have glacial dropstones.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1094" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1094" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/toby-a.png"><img width="300" height="217" class="size-medium wp-image-1094" alt="Figure 21.8 Late Proterozoic Toby Formation mudstone with glacial dropstones south of Cranbrook, B.C.

The clastic sediments of the Windermere Group are succeeded by mostly limestone beds (represented by the blue areas in Figure 21.7) interbedded in some areas with mudstone and sandstone. The most famous Cambrian rocks in the Rockies are those around Field, B.C., within Yoho and Kootenay National Parks. The Burgess Shale of the Stephen Formation is considered by some to be the most important fossil bed in the world because of its spectacular preservation of detail in a wide array of organisms that are ancestors to many of today’s organisms and are not present in earlier rocks. The Walcott Quarry, on the pass between Mt. Field and Wapta Mountain has been known and studied for over 100 years (Figure 21.9). In 2012 a new Burgess Shale discovery was made at Marble Canyon, about 30 km to the southeast, by a team led by the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM). Fossils with similar levels of preservation are present, and several previously unknown organisms have been found. The ROM continues to work in the Marble Canyon area and some of their discoveries are described and illustrated on this website: <a href="https://www.rom.on.ca/en/blog/mighty-burgess-shale-fossil-site-discovered-in-kootenay-national-park">https://www.rom.on.ca/en/blog/mighty-burgess-shale-fossil-site-discovered-in-kootenay-national-park</a>. The Paleozoic strata of the Rockies also include Ordovician, Devonian, Carboniferous, and Permian sedimentary rocks. For example, Carboniferous limestone makes up most of the upper part of Crowsnest Mountain in southern Alberta (Figure 21.1).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1382" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1382" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Cambrian-Burgess-Shale-at-the-Walcott-Quarry.jpg"><img class="wp-image-1382" alt="Figure 21.9 The Cambrian Burgess Shale at the Walcott Quarry, Yoho Park, B.C., with Wapta Mountain in the upper right.

This region is known as the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB). The Paleozoic sediments that accumulated within this basin show up as the blue areas in Figures 21.4 and 21.5; however, their extent is much wider than that because Paleozoic sedimentary rocks also underly the Mesozoic rocks within most of the areas that are light green on those maps. By way of example, a schematic cross-section through the Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks of southern Manitoba is given in Figure 21.10. The section extends from the Saskatchewan-Manitoba border on the left to just east of Winnipeg on the right, and shows the Paleozoic rocks overlain on the rocks of the Precambrian Superior Craton.</p> <p>Fifteen different Paleozoic formations, ranging in age from Ordovician to Carboniferous, are shown in Figure 21.10. Of these, 11 are dominated by carbonate rocks (limestone or dolomite) that very likely formed in an ocean-connected marine environment. The non-carbonate formations are the lowermost one (resting on Precambrian rocks), which is sandstone of marine origin; the Devonian Prairie Evaporite Formation (in red) — the same formation from which potash is mined in Saskatchewan; and the upper two Devonian formations (in yellow), which are shale. When the Prairie Evaporite formed, the basin was isolated from the open ocean, and the rate of evaporation was greater than the rate of input from precipitation and river inflow. During that time, probably at least several million years, there were numerous changes in sea level or land level that allowed additional ocean water — and therefore additional salt — into the basin.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1405" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1405" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Paleozoic-sedimentary-rocks.png"><img class="wp-image-1405" alt="Figure 21.10 The Paleozoic sedimentary rocks of southern Manitoba along a section extending from the Saskatchewan border on the left to the Winnipeg area on the right.

Subduction started along the western edge of Laurentia by the middle Paleozoic. That meant that oceanic crust was moving toward the continent, bringing small segments of exotic continental crust with it (Figure 21.11). These crustal blocks along western North America are called <strong>terranes</strong>, indicating that they are sections of the continent that have an exotic origin (Figure 21.12).

The upper-crustal magma chambers that fed those now-eroded volcanoes slowly cooled into granitic and dioritic stocks, and those stocks gradually coalesced into batholiths that extend from the southwest corner of B.C. all the way into Yukon and Alaska (Figures 21.20 and 21.21). Most of the granitic rocks of this region fall into two main age ranges: many are middle-Jurassic to early Cretaceous in age (~ 170 Ma to 140 Ma), while others are late Cretaceous to Paleogene (~50 Ma to 90 Ma). Many of the older bodies intruded into the terranes they are on before they arrived on the North America coast. This applies to those on Vancouver Island and Haida Gwaii. Some of the older ones formed in situ when the subduction zone was farther east (see Figure 21.13). Most of the younger bodies formed in situ when the subduction zone was close to where it is now (west of Vancouver Island) or slightly to the east.</p> <p>Although these intrusive igneous rocks cooled at depth in the upper crust, they now form some of the highest peaks in Canada, many of them hundreds of metres higher than those of the Rocky Mountains (including Mt. Waddington, the highest peak entirely within British Columbia at 4,091 m). It is estimated that over the past 100 million years some of these igneous bodies have been uplifted in the order of 8,000 m. Much of that uplift is a result of the relative low density of the granitic rocks compared with the surrounding rocks.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1398" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1398" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/Jurassic-and-Cretaceous-granitic-bodies.png"><img class="wp-image-1398" alt="Figure 21.20 Jurassic (J) and Cretaceous (K) granitic bodies in south-central B.C.

Based on the ages, distributions, and thicknesses of the sedimentary layers (Figure 21.23), it is evident that the greatest volumes of sediment were produced in the Upper Cretaceous (100 Ma to 65 Ma) and into the Paleocene (65 Ma to 55 Ma). The sediments accumulated in a basin that is thought to have been at least partly formed by the presence of a subducting slab of oceanic lithosphere underneath this part of North America. However, the ongoing uplift of the Rockies through this time period also led to isostatic depression of the crust. The western edge of the basin, which has about 4,500 m of Mesozoic rock alone, is a foreland basin. (See Chapter 6 for more on the origins of basins.)</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1389" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1389" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/08/distribution-of-Mesozoi-sedimentary-rocks.png"><img class="wp-image-1389" alt="Figure 21.22 The distribution of Mesozoic sedimentary rocks in the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin.

The Jurassic rocks at the base of the sequence are marine in origin, although the Jurassic sequence in Manitoba also includes evaporite layers. Most of the Middle Cretaceous rocks across the basin are marine, but the majority of the Upper Cretaceous rocks are of terrestrial origin, deposited within the flood plains and deltas of rivers. Some of these terrestrial sediments include coal layers; as described in Chapter 20, there are significant coal deposits in central Alberta.</p> <p>The Paleozoic sediments within the WCSB were buried deeply beneath the Mesozoic sediments and were heated enough to form both oil and gas.

Over the past 650 Ma, Laurentia moved north from deep within the southern hemisphere. During that time, a number of important plate-tectonic events have taken place, including formation of the Appalachian and Innuitian fold belts, sedimentation within the interior of the continent, and terrane accretion and mountain formation along the west coast.</td> </tr> <tr><th>21.2</th> <th>Western Canada during the Precambrian</th> <td>The two oldest parts of the Canadian Shield in western Canada are the Slave and Superior Cratons, and both include some of Earth’s oldest rocks. During the formation of Laurentia, these cratons were combined with the Rae and Hearn Cratons, with the collision zones now represented by the Trans-Hudson Orogen and the Taltson Magmatic Zone. Continental sediments accumulated in Saskatchewan and Nunavut at around 1,700 Ma and in the area of the southern B.C.-Alberta border at around 1,400 Ma. This region was rifted apart during the breakup of the supercontinent Columbia, after which sedimentation continued on the western margin of Laurentia with the deposition of the Windermere Group.</td> </tr> <tr><th>21.3</th> <th>Western Canada during the Paleozoic</th> <td>Sedimentation on the west coast of North America continued into the early Paleozoic, and by the Ordovician, the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin (WCSB) had developed, extending from southern Manitoba to the northern Northwest Territories. Most of the Paleozoic rocks in this basin, which range in age up to the Carboniferous, have marine affinities, although there are important evaporites as well. Sedimentation continued on the west coast through this time, but by the late Paleozoic, a subduction boundary had developed along the coast and small continents were moving toward North America.</td> </tr> <tr><th>21.4</th> <th>Western Canada during the Mesozoic</th> <td>The various parts of the Intermontane Superterrane began colliding with the west coast of North America during the Jurassic (~180 Ma). This started the building of the Rocky Mountains by the thrusting of existing sedimentary rocks toward the east. The arrival of the Insular Superterrane during the Cretaceous (~90 Ma) contributed to further thrusting and uplift of the Rockies, creating a significant source of sediments for the WCSB. The greatest volume of Mesozoic rocks in the basin are of Upper Cretaceous age, and that likely coincides with the period of maximum collision-related uplift of the Rockies. Subduction of oceanic crust at various locations along the west coast and within the accreted terranes prior to their arrival has produced massive volumes of intrusive igneous rocks within the Coast Range.</td> </tr> <tr><th>21.5</th> <th>Western Canada during the Cenozoic</th> <td>The Pacific Rim and Crescent Terranes were added to the western edge of Vancouver Island during the Paleogene, pushing the island closer to the mainland and forcing recently deposited Nanaimo Group rocks onto the island. Continuing subduction along the coast has generated ongoing volcanism and earthquake activity in southwestern B.C. Sedimentation continued in the WCSB into the Cenozoic, especially in the Paleocene with deposition of the terrestrial Paskapoo Formation in Alberta and similar rocks in southern Saskatchewan.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Questions for Review</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>1.

The big bang is often described as an explosion, but imagining it as an enormous fireball isn’t accurate. The big bang involved a sudden expansion of matter, energy, and space from a single point. The kind of Hollywood explosion that might come to mind involves expansion of matter and energy <em>within</em> space, but during the big bang, space <em>itself</em> was created.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1431" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1431" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/figure22.png"><img width="400" height="288" class="wp-image-1431" alt="Development of the galaxies." src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/figure22-e1441129772953.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1431">Figure 22.1 The big bang. The universe began 13.77 billion years ago with a sudden expansion of space, matter, and energy, and it continues to expand today. [KP, modified after NASA/ WMAP Science Team, http://bit.ly/BBdiagram]</div></div> <p>At the start of the big bang, the universe was too hot and dense to be anything but a sizzle of particles smaller than atoms, but as it expanded, it also cooled. Eventually some of the particles collided and stuck together. Those collisions produced hydrogen and helium, the most common elements in the universe, along with a small amount of lithium.</p> <p>You may wonder how a universe can be created out of nothing, or how we can know that the big bang happened at all. Creating a universe out of nothing is mostly beyond the scope of this chapter, but there is a way to think about it. The particles that make up the universe have opposites that cancel each other out, similar to the way that we can add the numbers 1 and -1 to get zero (also known as “nothing”). As far as the math goes, having zero is exactly the same as having a 1 and a -1. It is also exactly the same as having a 2 and a -2, a 3 and a -3, two -1s and a 2, and so on. In other words, <em>nothing</em> is really the potential for <em>something</em> if you divide it into its opposite parts. As for how we can know that the big bang happened at all, there are very good reasons to accept that it is indeed how our universe came to be.</p> <h1>Looking back to the early stages of the big bang</h1> <p>The notion of seeing the past is often used metaphorically when we talk about ancient events, but in this case it is meant literally. In our everyday experience, when we watch an event take place, we perceive that we are watching it as it unfolds in real time. In fact, this isn’t true. To see the event, light from that event must travel to our eyes. Light travels very rapidly, but it does not travel instantly. If we were watching a digital clock 1 m away from us change from 11:59 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., we would actually see it turn to 12:00 p.m. three billionths of a second after it happened. This isn’t enough of a delay to cause us to be late for an appointment, but the universe is a very big place, and the “digital clock” in question is often much, much farther away. In fact, the universe is so big that it is convenient to describe distances in terms of <strong>light years</strong>, or the distance light travels in one year. What this means is that light from distant objects takes so long to get to us that we see those objects as they were at some considerable time in the past. For example, the star Proxima Centauri is 4.24 light years from the sun. If you viewed Proxima Centauri from Earth on January 1, 2015, you would actually see it as it appeared in early October 2010.</p> <p>We now have tools that are powerful enough to look deep into space and see the arrival of light from early in the universe’s history. Astronomers can detect light from approximately 375,000 years after the big bang is thought to have occurred. Physicists tell us that if the big bang happened, then particles within the universe would still be very close together at this time. They would be so close that light wouldn’t be able to travel far without bumping into another particle and getting scattered in another direction. The effect would be to fill the sky with glowing fog, the “afterglow” from the formation of the universe (Figure 22.1). In fact, this is exactly what we see when we look at light from 375,000 years after the big bang. The fog is referred to as the <strong>cosmic microwave background</strong> (or CMB), and it has been carefully mapped throughout the sky (Figure 22.2). The map displays the cosmic microwave background as temperature variations, but these variations translate to differences in the density of matter in the early universe. The red patches are the highest density regions and the blue patches are the lowest density. Higher density regions represent the eventual beginnings of stars and planets. The map in Figure 22.2 has been likened to a baby picture of the universe.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1096" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/cmwb-2.png"><img width="300" height="150" class="size-medium wp-image-1096" alt="Figure 22.2 Cosmic microwave background (CMB) map of the sky, a baby picture of the universe.

It continues today, and we can see it happen by observing that large clusters of billions of stars, called <strong>galaxies</strong>, are moving away from us. (The exception is the Andromeda galaxy with which we are on a collision course.) The astronomer Edwin Hubble came to this conclusion when he observed that the light from other galaxies was red-shifted. The <strong>red shift</strong> is a consequence of the Doppler effect. This refers to how we see waves when the object that is creating the waves is moving toward us or away from us.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1433" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1433" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/figure22.3.png"><img width="400" height="420" class="wp-image-1433" alt="Duckling illustrates the Doppler effect in water" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/figure22.3.png" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1433">Figure 22.3 Duckling illustrates the Doppler effect in water.

The duckling swimming in Figure 22.3 is generating waves as it moves through the water. It is generating waves that move forward as well as back, but notice that the ripples ahead of the duckling are closer to each other than the ripples behind the duckling. The distance from one ripple to the next is called the <strong>wavelength</strong>. The wavelength is shorter in the direction that the duckling is moving, and longer as the duckling moves away.</p> <p>When waves are in air as sound waves rather than in water as ripples, the different wavelengths manifest as sounds with different pitches — the short wavelengths have a higher pitch, and the long wavelengths have a lower pitch. This is why the pitch of a car’s engine changes as the car races past you.</p> <p>For light waves, wavelength translates to colour (Figure 22.4). In the spectrum of light that we can see, shorter wavelengths are on the blue end of the spectrum, and longer wavelengths are on the red end of the spectrum. Does this mean that galaxies look red because they are moving away from us? No, but the colour we see is shifted toward the red end of the spectrum and longer wavelengths.</p> <p>Notice that the sun’s spectrum in the upper part of Figure 22.4 has some black lines in it. The black lines are there because some colours are missing in the light we get from the Sun. Different elements absorb light of specific wavelengths, and many of the black lines in Figure 22.4 represent colours that are absorbed by hydrogen and helium within the Sun. This means the black lines are like a bar code that can tell us what a star is made of. The lower spectrum in Figure 22.4 is the light coming from BAS11, an enormous cluster of approximately 10,000 galaxies located 1 billion light years away. The black lines represent the same elements as in the Sun’s spectrum, but they are shifted to the right toward the red end of the spectrum because BAS11 is moving away from us as the universe continues to expand. So to summarize, because almost all of the galaxies we can see have light that is red-shifted, it means they are all moving away from us. In fact, the farther away they are, the faster they are going. This is evidence that the universe is still expanding.</p> </div></div>

Most of the remaining 5% comes from aluminum, calcium, nickel, hydrogen, and sulphur. We know that the big bang made hydrogen, helium, and lithium, but where did the rest of the elements come from?</p> <p>The answer is that the other elements were made by stars. Sometimes stars are said to “burn” their fuel, but burning is not at all what is going on within stars. The burning that happens when wood in a campfire is turned to ash and smoke is a chemical reaction — heat causes the atoms that were in the wood and in the surrounding atmosphere to exchange partners. Atoms group in different ways, but the atoms themselves do not change. What stars do is change the atoms. The heat and pressure within stars cause smaller atoms to smash together and fuse into new, larger atoms. For example, when hydrogen atoms smash together and fuse, helium is formed. Large amounts of energy are released when some atoms fuse and that energy is what causes stars to shine.</p> <p>It takes larger stars to make elements as heavy as iron and nickel. Our Sun is an average star; after it uses up its hydrogen fuel to make helium, and then some of that helium is fused to make small amounts of beryllium, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine, it will be at the end of its life. It will stop making atoms and will cool down and bloat until its middle reaches the orbit of Mars. In contrast, large stars end their lives in spectacular fashion, exploding as supernovae and casting off newly formed atoms —including the elements heavier than iron — into space. It took many generations of stars creating heavier elements and casting them into space before heavier elements were abundant enough to form planets like Earth.</p> <p>Until recently, astronomers have only been able to see stars that already contain heavier elements in small amounts, but not the first-generation stars that started out before any of the heavier elements were produced. That changed in June of 2015 when it was announced that a distant galaxy called CR7 had been found that contained stars made only of hydrogen and helium. The galaxy is so far away that it shows us a view of the universe from only 800 million years after the big bang.<span class="footnote">Read more about the discovery of CR7 here: <a href="http://bit.ly/CR7galaxy">http://bit.ly/CR7galaxy</a></span></p> <div><div></div> </div> </div></div>

All solar systems start out the same way. They begin in a cloud of gas and dust called a <strong>nebula</strong>. Nebulae are some of the most beautiful objects that have been photographed in space, with vibrant colours from the gases and dust they contain, and brilliant twinkling from the many stars that have formed within them (Figure 22.5). The gas consists largely of hydrogen and helium, and the dust consists of tiny mineral grains, ice crystals, and organic particles.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1439" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.3.png"><img class="wp-image-1439" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/22.3-e1441130299324.png" alt="Figure 22.5 Photograph of a nebula.

Exactly how this starts isn’t clear, although it might be triggered by the violent behaviour of nearby stars as they progress through their life cycles. Energy and matter released by these stars might compress the gas and dust in nearby neighbourhoods within the nebula.</p> <p>Once it is triggered, the collapse of gas and dust within that patch continues for two reasons. One of those reasons is that gravitational force pulls gas molecules and dust particles together. But early in the process, those particles are very small, so the gravitational force between them isn’t strong. So how do they come together? The answer is that dust first accumulates in loose clumps for the same reason dust bunnies form under your bed: static electricity. Given the role of dust bunnies in the early history of the solar system, one might speculate that an accumulation of dust bunnies poses a substantial risk to one’s home (Figure 22.6). In practice, however, this is rarely the case.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1443" style="width: 228px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.6.png"><img class="wp-image-1443" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/22.6.png" alt="Figure 22.6 Public service announcement.

The disk is where planets eventually form, so it’s called a <strong>protoplanetary disk</strong>. In Figure 22.7 the image in the upper left shows an artist’s impression of a protoplanetary disk, and the image in the upper right shows an actual protoplanetary disk surrounding the star HL Tauri. Notice the dark rings in the protoplanetary disk. These are gaps where planets are beginning to form. The rings are there because incipient planets are beginning to collect the dust and gas in their orbits. There is an analogy for this in our own solar system, because the dark rings are akin to the gaps in the rings of Saturn (Figure 22.7, lower left), where moons can be found (Figure 22.7, lower right).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1445" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.7.png"><img class="wp-image-1445" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/22.7-e1441139690764.png" alt="Figure 22.7 Protoplanetary disks and Saturn’s rings.

Often, the ice giant planets Uranus and Neptune are grouped with Jupiter and Saturn as gas giants; however, Uranus and Neptune are very different from Jupiter and Saturn.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1446" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.8.png"><img class="wp-image-1446" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/22.8-e1441139905761.png" alt="Figure 22.8 Three types of planets.

Instead they occur in a systematic way, with terrestrial planets closest to the sun, followed by the Jovian planets and then the ice giants (Figure 22.9). Smaller <strong>solar system</strong> objects follow this arrangement as well. The <strong>asteroid belt</strong> contains bodies of rock and metal. Bodies ranging from metres to hundreds of metres in diameter are classified as <strong>asteroids</strong>, and smaller bodies are referred to as <strong>meteoroids</strong>. In contrast, the <strong>Kuiper belt </strong>(<em>Kuiper</em> rhymes with <em>piper</em>), and the <strong>Oort cloud</strong> (<em>Oort</em> rhymes with <em>sort</em>), which are at the outer edge of the solar system, contain bodies composed of large amounts of ice in addition to rocky fragments and dust.

The frost line separated the inner part of the protoplanetary disk closer to the sun, where it was too hot to permit anything but silicate minerals and metal to crystalize, from the outer part of the disk farther from the Sun, where it was cool enough to allow ice to form. As a result, the objects that formed in the inner part of the protoplanetary disk consist largely of rock and metal, while the objects that formed in the outer part consist largely of gas and ice. The young sun blasted the solar system with raging <strong>solar winds </strong>(winds made up of energetic particles), which helped to drive lighter molecules toward the outer part of the protoplanetary disk.</p> <p>The objects in our solar system formed by <strong>accretion</strong>. Early in this process, particles collected in fluffy clumps because of static electricity. As the clumps grew larger, gravity became more important and collected clumps into solid masses, and solid masses into larger and larger bodies. If you were one of these bodies in the early solar system, and participating in the accretion game with the goal of becoming a planet, you would have to follow some key rules:</p> <ul><li>Keep your velocity just right. If you move too fast and collide with another body, you both smash up and have to start again. If you move slowly enough, gravity will keep you from bouncing off each other and you can grow larger.</li> <li>Your distance from the Sun will determine how big you can get. If you are closer, there is less material for you to collect than if you are farther away.</li> <li>To begin with, you can only collect mineral and rock particles. You have to grow above a certain mass before your gravity is strong enough to hang onto gas molecules, because gas molecules are very light.</li> <li>As your mass increases, your gravity becomes stronger and you can grab material from farther away. The bigger you are, the faster you grow.</li> </ul> <p>You would also have to watch out for some dangers:</p> <ul><li>In the early stages of the game, the protoplanetary disk is turbulent, and you and other objects can get thrown into different orbits or at each other. This might be a good thing, or it might not, depending on how the rules above apply to you.</li> <li>If the game progresses to the point where there is no more material within your reach and you are not yet a planet, then it&#8217;s game over.</li> <li>If you slow down too much (e.g., from bumping into other objects), you could spiral into the Sun (game over).</li> <li>If another planet gets big enough, it can: <ul><li>Rip you apart and then swing the pieces around so fast that for the rest of the game you collide too hard with other pieces to grow any bigger (game over)</li> <li>Fling you out of the solar system (game over)</li> <li>Grab you for itself (game over)</li> <li>Trap you in an orbit around it, turning you into a moon (game over, and incredibly humiliating)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The outcome of the game is evident in Figure 22.9. Today eight official winners are recognized, with Jupiter taking the grand prize, followed closely by Saturn. Both planets have trophy cases with more than 60 moons each, and each has a moon that is larger than Mercury. Prior to 2006, Pluto was also counted a winner, but in 2006 a controversial decision revoked Pluto’s planet status. The reason was a newly formalized definition of a planet, which stated that an object can only be considered a planet if it is massive enough to have swept its orbit clean of other bodies. Pluto is situated within the icy clutter of the Kuiper belt, so it does not fit this definition. Pluto’s supporters have argued that Pluto should have been grandfathered in, given that the definition came after Pluto was declared a planet, but to no avail. Pluto has not given up, and on July 13, 2015, it launched an emotional plea with the help of the NASA’s New Horizons probe. New Horizons sent back images of Pluto’s heart (Figure 22.10). On closer inspection, Pluto’s heart was discovered to be broken.</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1448" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.10.png"><img class="wp-image-1448" src="https://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2016/07/22.10-e1441140386417.png" alt="Figure 22.10 Photographs of Pluto.

Jupiter’s immense gravity interfered with Mars’ ability to accrete. Further evidence of Jupiter’s interference is the debris field that forms the asteroid belt. From time to time, Jupiter still flings objects from the asteroid belt out into other parts of the solar system, some of which have collided with Earth to catastrophic effect.</li> <li>The Kuiper belt is an icy version of the asteroid belt, consisting of fragments left over from the early solar system. The material in the Kuiper belt is scattered because of Neptune’s gravity. From time to time, Jupiter interferes here as well, flinging Kuiper belt objects toward the Sun and into orbit. As these objects approach the Sun, the Sun causes dust and gas to be blasted from their surface, forming tails. We know these objects as comets.</li> <li>Comets may also come from the Oort cloud where gravitational forces from outside of the solar system can hurl objects from the Oort cloud toward the Sun. <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><strong>Exercise 22.1 How Do We Know What Other Planets Are Like Inside?</strong>The densities of planets give us important clues about the planets’ compositions. For example, in our solar system, Earth (a terrestrial planet) has a density of 5.51 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, but Jupiter (a gas giant) has a density of 1.33 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. We can also use density to determine something about the interior structures of planets. In this exercise, you will determine how much of each terrestrial planet is made up of core, and translate that result to a diagram for easy comparison. <p>It is useful to approximate the structure of a terrestrial planet as having two parts: a metal core and a rocky mantle. If we know the density of the planet as a whole, and the densities of the materials making up the rocky mantle and the core, we can find out how much of the planet is core and how much is rocky. The density of the planet is the sum of the percent having the density of the core and the percent having the density of rock. This can be written as follows:</p> <p>planet density = % core/100 x core density + (1- %core/100) x rock density</p> <p>Rearranging the equation gives us:</p> <p>% core = (planet density &#8211; rock density)/ (core density- rock density) x 100</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>. Find the percent core for each of the terrestrial planets using the data in Tables 22.1 and 22.2. For our calculations the planet density will be the <strong>uncompressed density</strong> of the planet. Uncompressed density is the density after removing the effects of gravity squeezing the planet together. (Notice that the density we mentioned for Earth is 5.51 g/cm<sup>3</sup>, but Earth’s uncompressed density is only 4.05 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.)

Large patches of Earth’s surface would still be molten, which would make landing your time machine very dangerous indeed. If you happened to have one of the newer time-machine models with hovering capabilities and heat shields, you would still face the inconvenience of having nothing to breathe but a tenuous wisp of hydrogen and helium gas, and depending on how much volcanic activity was going on, volcanic gases such as water vapour and carbon dioxide. Some ammonia and methane might be thrown in just to make it interesting, but there would be no oxygen. Assuming you had the foresight to purchase the artificial atmosphere upgrade for your time machine, it would all be for naught if you materialized just in time to see an asteroid, or worse yet another planet, bearing down on your position. The moral of the story is that early Earth was a nasty place, and a time machine purchase is not something to take lightly.</p> <p>Why was early Earth so nasty?</p> <h1>The early Earth was hot</h1> <p>Chapter 9 explains that Earth’s heat comes from the decay of radioactive elements within Earth, as well as from processes associated with Earth’s formation. Let’s look more closely at how those formation processes heated up Earth.</p> <ul><li>Heat came from the thermal energy already contained within the objects that accreted to form the Earth.</li> <li>Heat came from collisions. When objects hit Earth, some of the energy from their motion went into deforming Earth, and some of it was transformed into heat. Clap your hands vigorously to experience this on a much smaller (and safer!) scale.</li> <li>As Earth became larger, its gravitational force became stronger. This increased Earth’s ability to draw objects to it, but it also caused the material making Earth to be compressed, rather like Earth giving itself a giant gravitational hug. Compression causes materials to heat up.</li> </ul> <p>Heating had a very important consequence for Earth’s structure. As Earth grew, it collected a mixture of silicate mineral grains as well as iron and nickel. These materials were scattered throughout Earth. That changed when Earth began to heat up: it got so hot that both the silicate minerals and the metals melted. The metal melt was much denser than the silicate mineral melt, so the metal melt sank to Earth’s centre to become its core, and the silicate melt rose upward to become Earth’s crust and mantle. In other words, Earth unmixed itself. The separation of silicate minerals and metals into a rocky outer layer and a metallic core, respectively, is called <strong>differentiation</strong>. The movement of silicate and metal melts within Earth caused it to heat up even more.</p> <p>Earth’s high temperature early in its history also means that early tectonic processes were accelerated compared to today, and Earth’s surface was more geologically active.</p> <h1>Earth was heavily bombarded by objects from space</h1> <p>Although Earth had swept up a substantial amount of the material in its orbit as it was accreting, unrest within the solar system caused by changes in the orbits of Saturn and Jupiter was still sending many large objects on cataclysmic collision courses with Earth. The energy from these collisions repeatedly melted and even vaporized minerals in the crust, and blasted gases out of Earth’s atmosphere. Very old scars from these collisions are still detectable, although we have to look carefully to see them. For example, the oldest impact site discovered is the 3 billion year old Maniitsoq “crater” in west Greenland, although there is no crater to see. What is visible are rocks that were 20 km to 25 km below Earth’s surface at the time of the impact, but which nevertheless display evidence of deformation that could only be produced by intense, sudden shock.</p> <p>The evidence of the very worst collision that Earth experienced is not subtle at all. In fact, you have probably looked directly at it hundreds of times already, perhaps without realizing what it is. That collision was with a planet named Theia, which was approximately the size of Mars (Figure 22.11). Not long after Earth formed, Theia struck Earth. When Theia slammed into Earth, Theia’s metal core merged with Earth’s core, and debris from the outer silicate layers was cast into space, forming a ring of rubble around Earth. The material within the ring coalesced into a new body in orbit around Earth, giving us our moon. Remarkably, the debris may have coalesced in 10 years or fewer! This scenario for the formation of the moon is called the <strong>giant impact hypothesis</strong><strong>. </strong></p> <h1>Earth’s atmosphere as we know it took a long time to develop</h1> <p>Earth’s first experiment with having an atmosphere didn’t go well. It started out with a thin veil of hydrogen and helium gases that came with the material it accreted. However, hydrogen and helium are very light gases, and they bled off into space.</p> <p>Earth’s second experiment with having an atmosphere went much better. Volcanic eruptions built up the atmosphere by releasing gases. The most common volcanic gases are water vapour and carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), but volcanoes release a wide variety of gases. Other important contributions include sulphur dioxide (SO<sub>2</sub>), carbon monoxide (CO), hydrogen sulphide (H<sub>2</sub>S), hydrogen gas, and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>). Meteorites and comets also brought substantial amounts of water and nitrogen to Earth. It is not clear what the exact composition of the atmosphere was after Earth’s second experiment, but carbon dioxide, water vapour, and nitrogen were likely the three most abundant components.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1455" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1455" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/22.11.png"><img class="wp-image-1455" alt="Figure 22.11 Artist’s impression of a collision between planets.

Earth might not have survived a direct hit. [NASA/ JPL-Caltech, http://1.usa.gov/1IkP069]</div></div> <p>One thing we can say for sure about Earth’s second experiment is that there was effectively no free oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>, the form of oxygen that we breathe) in the atmosphere. We know this in part because prior to 2 billion years ago, there were no sedimentary beds stained red from oxidized iron minerals. Iron minerals were present, but not in oxidized form. At that time, O<sub>2</sub> was produced in the atmosphere when the Sun’s ultraviolet rays split water molecules apart; however, chemical reactions removed the oxygen as quickly as it was produced.</p> <p>It wasn’t until well into Earth’s third experiment — life — that the atmosphere began to become oxygenated. Photosynthetic organisms used the abundant CO<sub>2</sub> in the atmosphere to manufacture their food, and released O<sub>2</sub> as a by-product. At first all of the oxygen was consumed by chemical reactions, but eventually the organisms released so much O<sub>2</sub> that it overwhelmed the chemical reactions and oxygen began to accumulate in the atmosphere, although present levels of 21% oxygen didn’t occur until about 350 Ma. Today the part of our atmosphere that isn’t oxygen consists largely of nitrogen (78%).</p> <p>The oxygen-rich atmosphere on our planet is life’s signature. If geologic process were the only processes controlling our atmosphere, it would consist mostly of carbon dioxide, like the atmosphere of Venus. It is an interesting notion (or a disconcerting one, depending on your point of view) that for the last 2 billion years the light reflected from our planet has been beaming a bar code out to the universe, similar to the ones in Figure 22.4, except ours says “oxygen.” For 2 billion years, our planet has been sending out a signal that could cause an observer from another world to say, “That’s odd… I wonder what’s going on over there.”</p> </div></div>

On the other hand, if you are asking if other planets exist that are rocky worlds approximately Earth’s size, and orbiting within their star’s <strong>habitable zone</strong> (the zone in which liquid water, and potentially life, can exist), then many planet hunters are cautiously optimistic that we have found at least 12 such worlds so far.</p> <p>As of July 2015, NASA’s Kepler mission has detected a total of 4,696 possible exoplanets. The Kepler spacecraft has an instrument to measure the brightness of stars, and looks for tiny variations in brightness that could be caused by a planet passing between the star it orbits and the instrument observing the star. Potential candidates are then examined in more detail to see whether they are in fact planets or not. So far 1,030 of those candidates have been confirmed as planets.<span class="footnote">You can access a catalogue of confirmed exoplanets found by NASA and other planet-hunting organizations at http://exoplanet.eu/catalog/</span> Of those, 12 satisfy the criteria of being one to two times the size of Earth, and orbiting their star within the habitable zone.<span class="footnote">Read more about habitable-zone planets discovered so far at http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/finding-another-earth</span></p> <p>The uncertainty about the 12 possible Earth-like worlds is related to their composition. We don’t yet know their composition; however, it is tempting to conclude that they are rocky because they are similar in size to Earth. Remember the rules of the accretion game: you can only begin to collect gas once you are a certain size, and how much matter you collect depends on how far away from the Sun you are. Given how large our gas giant and ice giant planets are compared to Earth, and how far away they are from the Sun, we would expect that a planet similar in size to Earth, and a similar distance from its star, should be rocky.</p> <p>It isn’t quite as simple as that, however. We are finding that the rules to the accretion game can result in planetary systems very different from our own, leading some people to wonder whether those planetary systems are strange, or ours is, and if ours is strange, how strange is it?</p> <p>Consider that in the Kepler mission’s observations thus far, it is very common to find planetary systems with planets larger than Earth orbiting closer to their star than Mercury does to the Sun. It is rare for planetary systems to have planets as large as Jupiter, and where large planets do exist, they are much closer to their star than Jupiter is to the Sun. To summarize, we need to be cautious about drawing conclusions from our own solar system, just in case we are basing those conclusions on something truly unusual.</p> <p>On the other hand, the seemingly unique features of our solar system would make planetary systems like ours difficult to spot. Small planets are harder to detect because they block less of a star’s light than larger planets. Larger planets farther from a star are difficult to spot because they don’t go past the star as frequently. For example, Jupiter goes around the Sun once every 12 years, which means that if someone were observing our solar system, they might have to watch for 12 years to see Jupiter go past the Sun once. For Saturn, they might have to watch for 30 years.</p> <div><h1>So let’s say the habitable-zone exoplanets are terrestrial. Does that mean we could live there?</h1> <p>The operational definition of “other Earths,” which involves a terrestrial composition, a size constraint of one to two times that of Earth, and location within a star’s habitable zone, does not preclude worlds incapable of supporting life as we know it. By those criteria, Venus is an “other Earth,” albeit right on the edge of the habitable zone for our Sun. Venus is much too hot for us, with a constant surface temperature of 465°C (lead melts at 327°C). Its atmosphere is almost entirely carbon dioxide, and the atmospheric pressure at its surface is 92 times higher than on Earth. Any liquid water on its surface boiled off long ago. Yet the characteristics that make Venus a terrible picnic destination aren’t entirely things we could predict from its distance from the sun. They depend in part on the geochemical evolution of Venus, and at one time Venus might have been a lot more like a youthful Earth. These are the kinds of things we won’t know about until we can look carefully at the atmospheres and compositions of habitable-zone exoplanets.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><h1><span style="font-size: 11.0pt; line-height: 115%;">Exercise 22.2 How Do We Know the Sizes of Exoplanets?</span></h1> <p>One of the techniques for finding exoplanets is to measure changes in the brightness of a host star as the planet crosses in front of it and blocks some of its light. This diagram shows how the brightness changes over time. The dip in brightness reflects a planet crossing between the star and the instrument observing the star.</p> <p>Often the planet itself is too small to see directly. If all we know is how the planet affects the brightness of the star, and we can’t even see the planet, then how do we know how big the planet is? The answer is that the two are related.

Geology involves integration of various different sciences (chemistry, physics, and biology for example), but also requires an understanding of the importance of billions of years of geological time.<br /> 2. Paleontology is an important aspect of geology and requires an understanding of biology, including evolution, the physiology of animals and plants and ecological relationships.<br /> 3. Geologists provide information to reduce the risk of harm from hazards such as earthquakes, volcanoes, and slope failures; they play a critical role in the discovery of important resources; they contribute to our understanding of life and its evolution through paleontological studies; and they play a leading role in the investigation of climate change, past and present and its implications.<br /> 4. Halite is composed of sodium (Na) and chlorine (Cl) with the Na+ and Cl- ions alternating with one another in all three directions within a cubic structure.<br /> 5. A mineral has a specific chemical composition and lattice structure. Rocks are made out of minerals, and most rocks contain several different types of minerals.<br /> 6. The main component of Earth’s core is iron (Fe).<br /> 7. Transfer of heat from the core to the mantle leads to heating of lower mantle rock. When heated, the rock expands and its density is reduced. Because the mantle is plastic, this lower-density material tends to rise toward the surface, and cooler denser mantle material moves in to take its place.<br /> 8. Mantle convection creates the traction that can force plates to move around on the surface.<br /> 9. Hot mantle rock moving toward the surface partially melts because the pressure is reduced. The magma produced moves upward into cracks in the crust and is extruded onto the sea floor.<br /> 10. 215 &#8211; 65 = 150 Ma. Since the age of the Earth is 4570 Ma, this represents 150/4,570 = 0.033 or 3.3% of geological time.<br /> 11. At 1 mm/y 30,000,000 mm would accumulate over that 30 million years. This is equivalent to 30,000 m or 30 km. Few sequences of sedimentary rock are even close to that thickness because most sediments accumulate at much lower rates, more like 0.1 mm/y.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter2"></a><strong>Chapter 2</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Charges: proton: +1, neutron: 0, electron: -1, Masses: proton: 1, neutron: 1, electron: almost 0.<br /> 2. The element’s atomic number will determine the extent to which its outer layers are populated with electrons. If the outer shell is not quite full, the atom may gain electrons to fill them and become an anion (negative charge). If the outer shell has only a few electrons, it may lose them and become a cation (positive charge). Cations and anions attract each other to form molecules with ionic bonding.<br /> 3. Helium and neon (and the other noble gases) have complete outer shells and therefore no tendency to form ionic bonds.<br /> 4. Electrons are transferred from one atom to another to form an ionic bond. Electrons are shared between atoms to form a covalent bond.<br /> 5. An anion has a negative charge and a cation has a positive charge.<br /> 6. Minerals are classified into groups based on their anion or anion group.<br /> 7. Name the mineral group for the following minerals:</p> <table><tbody><tr><td>calcite</td> <td>CaCO<sub>3</sub> carbonate</td> <td>biotite</td> <td>silicate</td> <td>pyrite</td> <td>FeS<sub>2</sub> sulphide</td> </tr> <tr><td>gypsum</td> <td>CaSO<sub>4</sub> sulphate</td> <td>galena</td> <td>PbS sulphide</td> <td>orthoclase</td> <td>KAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub> silicate</td> </tr> <tr><td>hematite</td> <td>Fe<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> oxide</td> <td>graphite</td> <td>C native</td> <td>magnetite</td> <td>Fe<sub>3</sub>O<sub>4</sub> oxide</td> </tr> <tr><td>quartz</td> <td>SiO<sub>2</sub> silicate</td> <td>fluorite</td> <td>CaF<sub>2</sub> halide</td> <td>olivine</td> <td>MgSiO<sub>4</sub> silicate</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>8. An unbonded silica tetrahedron has one Si ion (+4 charge) and 4 oxygens (-2 charge each) so the overall charge is 4 – 8 = -4 for SiO<sub>4</sub><sup>-4<br /> </sup>9. Magnesium can substitute freely for iron in olivine and several other minerals because they have similar charges (+2) and similar ionic radii.<br /> 10. Pyroxene is made up of single chains of tetrahedra while amphibole is made up of double chains.<br /> 11. Biotite includes iron and/or magnesium in its formula, while muscovite does not.<br /> 12. The two end-members of the plagioclase series are Albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) and Anorthite (CaAl<sub>2</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>8</sub>)<br /> 13. In quartz each silica tetrahedron is bonded to four other tetrahedra, and since oxygens are shared at each bond the overall ratio is silicon (+4) to two oxygens (2 x -2 = -4), which is balanced.<br /> 14. Some minerals have distinctive colours, but many have a wide range of colours due to differing impurities.<br /> 15. Glass has a Mohs hardness of about 5.5 while porcelain is close to 6.5. The mineral is between these two, so it must be close to 6.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter3"></a><strong>Chapter 3</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The rock must be exposed at surface so in many cases uplift and removal of overlying sediments is required. Then chemical and/or physical weathering can take place, which reduces the rock to smaller loose fragments. These fragments are sediments that can be eroded and then transported by a variety of maechanisms.<br /> 2. Sediments are buried beneath other sediments where, because of the increased pressure, they become compacted and dewatered. With additional burial they are warmed to the point where cementing minerals can form between the grains (less than 200˚C).<br /> 3. Rock is buried within the crust and heated because of the geothermal gradient. At temperatures over 200˚C some of the existing minerals may become unstable and will be converted to new minerals, or recrystallized into larger crystals.<br /> 4. As the temperature decreases minerals that formed early (e.g., olivine) may react with the remaining magma to form new minerals (e.g., pyroxene).<br /> 5. Calcium-rich plagioclase forms early on in the cooling process of a magma, but as the temperature drops, a more sodium-rich variety forms around the existing crystals.<br /> 6. Early-forming minerals, which are typically quite dense (e.g., olivine) may sink to the bottom of the magma chamber (if the magma is not too viscous) and thus become separated from the rest of the magma, resulting in a change to the composition of the remaining magma (it becomes more felsic).<br /> 7. If the texture is aphanitic the crystals are too small to see without a microscope. In rocks with phaneritic textures the minerals are large enough to see and distinguish from each other with the naked eye. The dividing line is somewhere between 0.1 and 1 mm, depending on the minerals.<br /> 8. In porphyritic rocks there are two distinct crystal sizes that are indicative of two stages of cooling (slow then fast). The fine material can range from glass to several mm, as long as the coarse crystals are distinctively larger. In pegmatitic rocks the crystals are consistently coarser than 1 cm, and can be much larger.

A discordant body (a dyke) cuts across any pre-existing layering or is situated at any angle in country rock that has no layering (e.g., granite).<br /> 11. A rock has to crack in order for a dyke to intrude into it, and it has to be cool to crack. When the hot magma intrudes into the cold country rock its margins cool quickly (forming small crystals), while its centre cools more slowly (forming larger crystals).<br /> 12. A batholith has an exposed area of greater than 100 km<sup>2;</sup> a stock has an exposed area less than that.<br /> 13. Batholiths (or stocks) intrude into existing rock by (a) melting through the country rock, or (b) causing the country rock to break and fall into the magma (stoping), or (c) pushing the country rock aside.<br /> 14. Compositional layering forms when early-crystallizing mineral sink toward the bottom of a magma chamber. This can only happen in non-viscous magma, and mafic magma is typically much less viscous than felsic magma.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter4"></a><strong>Chapter 4</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The three main tectonic settings for volcanism are (1) subduction zones at convergent plate boundaries, (2) divergent plate boundaries, and (3) mantle plumes (a.k.a. hot spots).<br /> 2. The primary mechanism for partial melting at a convergent plate boundary is the addition of water to hot mantle rock. The water reduces the melting temperature of the rock (flux melting).<br /> 3. The explosiveness of a volcanic eruption depends on the pressure of the magma. Gases create that pressure, and if the magma is viscous those gases cannot escape easily. Felsic and intermediate magmas tend to have more gas than mafic magmas, and are also more viscous, trapping the gas in.<br /> 4. When magma is deep within the crust the pressure is too high for the gases to bubble out of solution.<br /> 5. Pillow lavas form where mafic lava erupts in water. When the magma oozes out into the water the outside cools first forming a hard skin that maintains the pillow shape.<br /> 6. Composite volcanoes can produce rocks with a wide range of textures, including (1) aphanitic or porphyritic rock from lava flows, (2) pyroclastic rock (with textures ranging from fine ash to coarse fragments) from explosive eruptions, and (3) sedimentary rock from lahars.<br /> 7. A lahar is a mud flow or debris flow on a volcano. Lahars are common on composite volcanoes because they are steeper than shield volcanoes, they typically have ice and snow, and they are not as strong as shield volcanoes.<br /> 8. Some lahars form during an eruption when snow and ice melt quickly, while others may form from heavy rain.<br /> 9. The magma at shield volcanoes is typically non-viscous. It can flow easily and also tends to form lava tubes, and thus is able to extend a long way from the vent, forming a low broad shield.<br /> 10. Shield volcanoes tend to have much longer lives than composite volcanoes. Most of the Hawaiian shields, for example lasted 1 million years, while most composite volcanoes are younger than 100,000 years.<br /> 11. Weak seismic activity is associated with all stages of a volcanic eruption. In the early stages magma is moving at depth and pushing rock aside, creating small earthquakes. The flow of magma can also produce special type of seismic response known as harmonic tremor.<br /> 12. GPS technology is used to determine if there is any slow deformation of the flanks of a volcano related to movement of magma toward the surface.<br /> 13. The Mt. St. Helens columnar basalts were formed by a flow of mafic lava.<br /> 14. The Nazko Cone is thought to be related to a mantle plume.<br /> 15. No one is certain why there a lower rate of volcanism in B.C. than in adjacent Washington and Oregon, but one theory is that the northern part of the Juan de Fuca Plate (the Explorer Plate) is not subducting as quickly as the rest of the plate.<br /> 16. It is likely that carbon dioxide released during the eruption flowed downhill from the volcano to the village on the shore of the Nass River.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter5"></a><strong>Chapter 5</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Before a rock can be exposed at surface it has to be uplifted from where it formed deep in the crust, and the material on top has to be eroded.<br /> 2. Frost wedging is most effective at times when the weather swings between freezing at night and thawing during the day. In cold parts of B.C. that only happens consistently in spring and fall. In warmer regions it only happens consistently during the winter.<br /> 3. Under conditions of strong chemical weathering, feldspar albite (NaAlSi<sub>3</sub>O<sub>8</sub>) will be converted to a clay (such as kaolinite) and sodium ions in solution. Where mechanical weathering is predominant, albite will be broken into small pieces.<br /> 4. Acid rock drainage (ARD) creates acidic stream runoff and also enhances the solubility of a wide range of metals, some of which can be toxic.<br /> 5. Feldspar-rich sand is formed in areas where granitic rocks are being weathered and where mechanical weathering is strongly predominant over chemical weathering.<br /> 6. Most of the clay that forms during hydrolysis of silicate minerals ends up in rivers and is washed out to the oceans. There it eventually settles to the sea floor.<br /> 7. The mineral composition of the parent rock or sediment will influence the composition of the resulting soil. Slope is important because it will affect the degree to which materials will be eroded.<br /> 8. Clay minerals and iron move downward to produce the B horizon of a soil.<br /> 9. Removal of vegetation leaves soil exposed to erosion by water, and wind are the main processes of soil erosion in Canada.<br /> 10. Chernozemic soils are common in the southern prairies and parts of the BC southern interior, in areas that experience water deficits during the summer.<br /> 11. Luvisolic soils are found in central B.C., mostly over sedimentary rocks.<br /> 12. The weathering feldspar to clay involves the conversion of atmospheric carbon dioxide to dissolved bicarbonate, which ends up in the ocean.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter6"></a><strong>Chapter 6</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Sand grains range in size from 1/16 mm to 2 mm.<br /> 2. Both silt and clay feel smooth between your fingers, but only clay feels smooth in your mouth.<br /> 3. The key factor is particle size (not density). Settling velocity is controlled by the friction around the grain holding it up and the gravitational force pushing it down. The gravitational force is proportional to the grain volume and the friction is proportional to the surface area.<br /> 4. Conglomerate cannot be deposited by a slow-flowing river because clasts larger than 2 mm are not transported by slow-moving water.<br /> 5. Sediments are buried beneath other sediments where, because of the increased pressure, they become compacted and dewatered. With additional burial they are warmed to the point where cementing minerals can form between the grains (less than 200˚C).<br /> 6. Lithic arenite has less than 15% silt- and clay-sized particles, while a lithic wacke has more than 15%. Both have more than 10% rock fragments and more rock fragments than feldspar.<br /> 7. Feldspathic arenite has more than 10% feldspar and more feldspar than rock fragments. Quartz arenite has less than 10% feldspar and less than 10% rock fragments. Both have less than 15% silt and clay.<br /> 8. Source area lithology: rock that contains quartz (such as granite or sandstone), strong weathering to remove feldspar, long fluvial transportation to round the grains.<br /> 9. The carbon within carbonate deposits such as limestone originally comes from the atmosphere.<br /> 10. Most of Earth’s banded iron formations formed during the initial oxygenation of the atmosphere between 2.4 and 1.8 Ga because iron that had been soluble in the anoxic oceans became insoluble in the oxidized oceans.<br /> 11. Terrestrial depositional environments: rivers, lakes, deltas, deserts, glaciers. Marine depositional environments: continental shelves, continental slopes, deep ocean.<br /> 12. A foreland basin forms in the vicinity of a large range of mountains where the weight of the mountains depresses the crust on either side. A forearc basin lies between a subduction zone and the related volcanic arc.<br /> 13. (a) Bedding forms where there is an interruption or change in the depositional process, or a change in the composition of the material being deposited. (b) Cross-bedding forms in fluvial or aeolian environments where sand-sized sediments are being moved and ripples or dunes are present. (c) Graded bedding, and (d) mud cracks form where fine-grained (silt or clay) sediments are allowed to dry because the level of a lake decreases.<br /> 14. Reverse graded bedding forms during gravity flows, such as debris flows.<br /> 15. A formation is a series of beds that is distinct from other beds above and below it, and is thick enough to be shown on the geological maps that are widely used within the area in question.<br /> 16. The Nanaimo Group was actively mined for coal for many decades. During that time the names were given to members and individual beds that were important to the coal miners.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter7"></a><strong>Chapter 7</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Heat and pressure are the main agents of metamorphism. Heat leads to mineralogical changes in the rock. Pressure also influences those mineralogical changes, while directed pressure (greater pressure in one direction) leads to foliation.<br /> 2. At very low, low, medium, and high metamorphic grades, mudrock will be transformed into slate, phyllite, schist, and gneiss.<br /> 3. Granite remains largely unchanged at lower metamorphic grades because its minerals are still stable at those lower temperatures.<br /> 4. Foliation exists because as new minerals are forming in a situation of directed pressure they are forced to grow with their long axes perpendicular to the main pressure direction.<br /> 5. At a spreading ridge the heat from volcanism leads to the development of a groundwater convection system in the oceanic crustal rock. Heated water rises in the hot regions and is expelled into the ocean, while cold ocean water is drawn into the crust to replace it. The heated water leads to the conversion of ferromagnesian minerals (e.g., olivine and pyroxene) into chlorite and serpentine.<br /> 6. The geothermal gradient varies as a function of tectonic setting, being greatest in volcanic regions and lowest along subduction zones. As a result the depth at which specific metamorphic grades is achieved will vary (greater depth where the gradient is least).<br /> 7. The geothermal gradient is low within subduction zones (because the cold subducting oceanic crust takes a long time to heat up), so while pressure increases at the normal rate the temperature does not.<br /> 8. In order of increasing metamorphic grade: chlorite biotite, garnet, sillimanite.<br /> 9. The rocks at significant depth in the crust are already hot and subject to regional metamorphism, so the additional heat from a pluton doesn’t make a large difference.<br /> 10. Water from any source facilitates metamorphism. Magmatic fluids typically contain dissolved ions at higher levels than in regular groundwater (especially copper, zinc, silver, gold, lithium, beryllium, boron and fluorine) so can lead to formation of a unique set of minerals.<br /> 11. Metasomatism involves fluids from magmatic or groundwater sources that play an important role in transporting ions and leading to the formation of new minerals.<br /> 12. A hot pluton heats the surrounding water and this contributes to the development of a convection system in the groundwater, which can result a great deal of water, in some cases with elevated levels of specific ions, passing through the rock. Magmatic water also contributes to metasomatism.<br /> 13. Limestone must be present in the country rock to produce a skarn.<br /> 14. Two things that a geologist first considers when looking at a metamorphic rock are what the parent rock might have been, and what type of metamorphism has taken place.</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Metamorphic Rock</strong></td> <td><strong>Likely Parent Rock</strong></td> <td><strong>Grade and/or Type of Metamorphism</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Chlorite schist</td> <td>A rock enriched in ferromagnesian minerals, such as basalt.</td> <td>Low-grade regional metamorphism.</td> </tr> <tr><td>Slate</td> <td>Mudrock (shale, mudstone)</td> <td>Very low grade regional metamorphism</td> </tr> <tr><td>Mica-garnet schist</td> <td>A rock that is rich in aluminum, which includes most clay-bearing rocks.</td> <td>Medium-grade regional metamorphism</td> </tr> <tr><td>Amphibolite</td> <td>A rock enriched in ferromagnesian minerals, such as basalt.</td> <td>Medium- to high-grade regional metamorphism.</td> </tr> <tr><td>Marble</td> <td>Limestone or dolomite</td> <td>Regional or contact metamorphism.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><strong></strong></p> <p><strong><a id="chapter8"></a><strong>Chapter 8</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Xenoliths of basalt within a granite must be older than the granite according to the principle of inclusions.<br /> 2. (a) At both disconformities and paraconformities the beds above and below are parallel, but at a disconformity there is clear evidence of an erosion surface (the lower layers have been eroded). (b) A nonconformity is a boundary between sedimentary rocks above and non-sedimentary rocks below while an angular unconformity is a boundary between sedimentary rocks above and tilted and eroded and sedimentary layers below.<br /> 3. A useful index fossil must have survived for a relatively short period (e.g., around a million years), and also should have a wide distribution so that it can be used to correlate rocks from different regions.<br /> 4. The granitic rock “f” has been dated to 175 Ma. The wood in layer “d” is approximately 5,000 years old, so we can assume that layer “d” is no older than that, although it could be as much as a few hundred years younger if the wood was already old when it got incorporated into the rock.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/chart-1.png"><img width="483" height="313" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1518" alt="chart 1" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/chart-1.png" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/graph2.png"><img width="465" height="296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1519" alt="graph2" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/graph2.png" /></a></p> <p><strong></strong></p> <p>5. Layer “c” must be between 5,000 y and 275 Ma.<br /> 6. The unconformity between layer “c” and rock “f” is a nonconformity.<br /> 7. The granite (f) was eroded prior to deposition of “c”, so it’s likely that layer “b” was also eroded at the same time. If so, that makes the boundary between “c” and “b” a disconformity.<br /> 8. The last magnetic reversal was 780,000 years ago, so all rock formed since that time is normally magnetized and it isn’t possible to distinguish older rock from younger rock within that time period using magnetic data.<br /> 9. William Smith was familiar with the different diagnostic fossils of the rocks of England and Wales and was able to use them to identify rocks of different ages.<br /> 10. The last age of the Cretaceous is the Maastrichtian (70.6 to 65.5 Ma) and the first age of the Paleogene is the Danian (65.5 to 61.7 Ma).</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter9"></a><strong>Chapter 9</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Typical stony meteorites are similar in composition to the Earth’s mantle, while typical iron meteorites are similar to the core.<br /> 2. The crust/mantle, mantle/core, outer core/inner core are shown on the diagram below:</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/chapter-9.png"><img width="224" height="400" class="alignnone wp-image-1520 size-full" alt="Crust: At this scale the crust is no thicker than a pencil line.

P-waves can pass through a liquid and travel approximately twice as fast as S-waves (which cannot pass through a liquid).<br /> 4. P-wave velocity decreases at the core-mantle boundary because the outer core is liquid.<br /> 5. The mantle gets increasingly dense and strong with depth because of the increasing pressure. This difference affects both P-wave and S-wave velocities, and they are refracted toward the lower density mantle material (meaning they are bent out toward Earth’s surface).<br /> 6. The key evidence for mantle convection is that the rate of temperature increase within the mantle is less than expected and this can only be explained by a mantle that is mixing by convection. The mechanism for convection is the transfer of heat from the core to the mantle.<br /> 7. Earth’s magnetic field is generated within the liquid outer part of the core by the motion of the metallic core material.<br /> 8. The last two reversals of Earth’s magnetic field were at the beginning of the present Brunhes normal chron (0.78 Ma), and at the end of the Jaramillo normal subchron (0.90 Ma). <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geomagnetic_reversal#/media/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_late_Cenozoic.svg"><br /> </a>9. The isostatic relationship between the crust and the mantle is dependent on the plastic nature of the mantle.<br /> 10. In the area of the Rocky Mountains the crust is thickened and pushed down into the mantle. In Saskatchewan the crust is thinner and does not extend as far into the mantle.<br /> 11. During the Pleistocene glaciation British Columbia was pushed down by glacial ice and mantle rock flowed slowly out beneath the ocean floor. Now that the land area is rebounding, that mantle rock is flowing back and the offshore areas are subsiding.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter10"></a><strong>Chapter 10</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The evidence used by Wegener to support his idea of moving continents included matching continental shapes and geological features on either side of the Atlantic; common terrestrial fossils in South America, Africa, Australia, and India; and data on the rate of separation between Greenland and Europe.<br /> 2. The primary technical weakness of Wegener’s theory was that he had no realistic mechanism for making continents move.<br /> 3. (a0 Contractionists assumed that mountains formed because as the Earth contracted the crust wrinkled into mountains. (b) Permanentists assumed that mountains formed by the geosynclinal process.<br /> 4. In the late 19th century the trans-Atlantic paleontological matchups were explained by assuming that there must have been land bridges between the continents at some time in the past, or that terrestrial organisms had floated across the ocean on logs.<br /> 5. Continental crust is lighter than oceanic crust and cannot sink low enough into the mantle to become an ocean (although this can happen over limited areas, and commonly does happen along coastal areas of continental plates).<br /> 6. Prior to 1920, ocean depths were measured by dropping a weighted line over the side of ship. Echo sounding techniques were developed at around that time and that greatly facilitated the measurement of ocean depths.<br /> 7. Temperature increases quite rapidly with depth in the crust, but much less so in the mantle, and this implies mantle convection.<br /> 8. Paleomagnetic studies showed that old rocks on the continents had different pole positions than they do today, and also that they were progressively more different with time past. This implied either that the poles had moved or that the continents had moved. It was also found that the apparent polar wandering paths for different continents were different, and this supported the concept that the continents had moved.<br /> 9. The trenches associated with subductions zones are the deepest parts of the oceans.<br /> 10. The ocean ridge areas are the youngest parts of the sea floor and thus there hasn’t been time for much sediment to accumulate.<br /> 11. It was (and still is) assumed that high heat flow exists where mantle convection cells are moving hot rock from the lower mantle toward the surface, and that low heat flow exists where there is downward movement of mantle rock.<br /> 12. Earthquakes are consistently shallow and relatively small at ocean ridges. At ocean trenches earthquakes get increasingly deep in the direction that the subducting plate is moving. The earthquakes near to surface can be very large, while those at depth tend to be small.<br /> 13. In the Hess model new crust was formed at ocean ridges and then was consumed back into the mantle at the trenches.<br /> 14. Hess’s theory did not include the concept of tectonic plates.<br /> 15. The spreading ridge is shown as a yellow line.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/ridge.png"><img width="443" height="334" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1521" alt="ridge" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/ridge.png" /></a></p> <p>16. A mantle plume is a column of hot rock (not magma) that ascends toward the surface from the lower mantle. It is hypothesized that mantle plumes ascend as much as 10 times faster than the rate of mantle convection.<br /> 17. (a) Between the ridge segments there is movement in opposite directions along a transform fault. (b) Outside of the ridge segments the two plates are moving in the same direction and likely at about the same rate. In this case there is no faulting, and it is known as a fracture zone.<br /> 18. Tectonic plates are made up of crust and the lithospheric (rigid) part of the underlying mantle. The mantle part ensures that the very different oceanic and continental crust sections of a plate can act as one unit.<br /> 19. A mantle plume beneath a continent can cause the crust to form a dome which might eventually split open. Several mantle plumes along a line within a continent could lead to rifting.<br /> 20. Subduction does not take place at a continent-continent convergent zone because neither plate is dense enough to sink into the mantle.<br /> 21. The divergent boundaries are blue, the convergent boundaries are black with teeth on them, and the transform boundaries are red.<br /> 22. The motion directions are shown with black arrows (see map for names of plates).<br /> 23. The sense of motion on the Queen Charlotte Fault is shown with red arrows.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/drift.png"><img width="274" height="400" class="alignnone wp-image-1522 size-full" alt="drift" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/drift-e1442870066895.png" /></a></p> <p>24.Continental rifting is taking place along the East Africa Rift, and sea floor has recently been created in the Red Sea and also in the Gulf of California.<br /> 25. Over the next 50 million years California is likely to split away from the rest of North America along the San Andreas Fault and then move north toward Alaska.<br /> 26. The accumulation of sediment at a passive ocean-continent boundary will lead to the depression of the lithosphere and could eventually result in the separation of the oceanic and continental parts of the plate and the beginning of subduction.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter11"></a><strong>Chapter 11</strong></strong></p> <p>1. An earthquake is the shaking caused by the release of energy that takes place when rocks under stress within Earth break and then the two sides slide past each other.<br /> 2. Rocks under stress will deform elastically until they reach the point where the stored elastic energy exceeds the rock strength. At that point the rock breaks and an earthquake is produced.<br /> 3. The rupture surface is the surface over which there is displacement of rock during an earthquake. The magnitude of an earthquake is proportional to the area of the rupture surface and the average amount of displacement over that surface.<br /> 4. An aftershock is any earthquake that is considered to have been caused by a previous earthquake as a result of the transfer of stress from the original earthquake.<br /> 5. Episodic slip on the middle part of the Cascadia subduction zone decreases stress within that area, but some of that stress is transferred to the locked zone up dip along the plate boundary, there increasing the level of stress on the locked part.<br /> 6. Magnitude is the amount of energy released by an earthquake. Each earthquake has only one magnitude, although there are different ways of measuring it, and they may give slightly different results. Intensity is a measure of the amount of damage done or what people felt. Intensity varies depending on the distance to the epicentre and the type of rock or sediment underlying an area.<br /> 7. An M7.3 earthquake releases 1,024 times as much energy as an M5.3 earthquake.<br /> 8. The map shows a subduction boundary. The depth of earthquakes increases inshore (to the east) from the location of the subduction zone.<br /> 9. The dash-dot line shows approximately where the plate boundary is situated.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/dots.png"><img width="457" height="296" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1523" alt="dots" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/dots.png" /></a></p> <p>10. The plate on the left (Nazca Plate) is moving east and the one on the right (South America Plate) is moving west. This is the eastern coast of South America around Peru and Chile.<br /> 11. Both divergent and transform boundaries are associated with mid-ocean ridges. Most earthquakes take place on the transform boundaries.<br /> 12. The northward motion of the Pacific Plate relative to the North America Plate takes place along the San Andreas Fault in California and along the Queen Charlotte Fault off the coast of British Columbia and southern Alaska.<br /> 13. Unconsolidated sediments, especially if they are saturated with water, can lose strength when subjected to earthquake shaking. This can cause buildings to subside or tilt. Unconsolidated sediments can also amplify the vibrations of an earthquake.<br /> 14. Gas lines and electrical transmission wires are typically damaged during an earthquake, and this can lead to serious fires.<br /> 15. A large subduction earthquake (greater than M7.5) can generate a tsunami because they typically result in vertical displacement of the sea floor.<br /> 16. The 2004 Parkfield earthquake showed that we cannot rely on foreshocks to predict earthquakes, or on any of the many other parameters that were being carefully measured around Parkfield in the years leading up to the quake.<br /> 17. We should know about the history of past large earthquakes, the typical locations of small earthquakes, the types of geological materials beneath the surface (especially soft water-saturated sediments), the types of infrastructure that is present, and the various ways that people can be evacuated from an area or assistance can be brought in.<br /> 18. Forecasting involves estimating the risk of an earthquake happening in a region within a period of time (usually expressed in decades). Prediction involves stating that an earthquake is likely to happen at a certain location on a specific day or month or year in the future. With our current state of knowledge of earthquakes, prediction is not possible.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter12"></a><strong>Chapter 12</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Convergent plate boundaries are the most likely to contribute to compression, divergent boundaries to extension, and transform boundaries to shearing, however all of these stress regimes can exist at any one of these boundaries.<br /> 2. When elastic strain takes place the rock can rebound to its original shape. When there is plastic strain the rock will be permanently deformed.<br /> 3. Stronger rocks are more likely than weaker ones to deform elastically. Rock that is hot is more likely to deform plastically. Clay-bearing rocks are more likely to deform plastically when they are wet. If stress is applied quickly, the rock is more likely to break than if it is applied slowly.<br /> 4. The axial planes are shown with dashed red lines.<br /> <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/rocks.png"><img width="500" height="210" class="alignnone wp-image-1524 size-full" alt="rocks" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/rocks-e1442870353713.png" /></a></p> <p>5. Volcanic rocks cool quickly at surface and the resulting reduction in volume can easily lead to fracturing.<br /> 6. In a normal fault the rock above the fault moves down with respect to the lower rock. This normally indicates extension. In a reverse fault the rock above the fault is pushed up, which indicates compression.<br /> 7. Most faults near transform boundaries are strike-slip faults, meaning that there is horizontal motion along the fault.<br /> 8.(a) The beds are dipping at about 30˚ to the northwest. (b) If it is possible to show that the beds are not overturned then we can say that bed 4 is the oldest. (c) “a” is a dyke and it is dipping steeply to the northeast. (d) “b” is a fault and it is dipping steeply to the southeast. (e) The motion on fault “b” appears to be left lateral. There may also be some vertical motion on “b” (or in fact the motion may be entirely vertical), but we cannot determine that from the information provided.</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/rocks2.png"><img width="500" height="213" class="alignnone wp-image-1525 size-full" alt="rocks2" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/rocks2-e1442870488882.png" /></a></p> <p><strong><a id="chapter13"></a><strong>Chapter 13</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Approximately 1% of the Earth’s water is liquid fresh water.<br /> 2. Approxmately 30% of the Earth’s fresh water is groundwater.<br /> 3. A trellis drainage pattern typically forms on sedimentary rock that has been tilted and eroded<br /> 4. Many of the streams in the southwestern part of Vancouver Island flow to the ocean as waterfalls because the land has been uplifted relative to sea level over the past several thousand years.<br /> 5. The fastest water flow on a straight stretch of a stream will be in the middle of the stream near the surface.<br /> 6. 1 mm sand grains will be eroded if the velocity if over 20 cm/s and will be kept in suspension as long as the velocity is over 10 cm/s.<br /> 7. If the flow velocity is 1 cm/s particles less than 0.1 mm (fine sand or finer) can be transported, while those larger than 0.1 mm cannot. At this velocity no particles can be eroded.<br /> 8. A braided stream can develop where there is more sediment available than can be carried in the amount of water present at the rate at which that water is flowing. This may happen where the gradient drops suddenly, or where there is a dramatic increase in the amount of sediment available (e.g., following an explosive volcanic eruption).<br /> 9. If a meander is cut off it reduces the length of a stream so it increases the gradient.<br /> 10. The average gradient of the Fraser River between Hope and the Pacific Ocean is 0.28 m/km (or 28 cm/km).<br /> 11. In coastal regions of B.C. the highest levels of precipitation are in the winter, and large parts of most drainage basins are not frozen solid. As a result stream discharges tend to be greatest in the winter.<br /> 12. In most parts of Canada winter precipitation is locked up in snow until the melt season begins, and depending on the year and the location that happens in late spring or early summer. If the thaw is delayed because of a cold spring, and then happens very quickly, flooding is likely. Some regions also receive heavy rainfall during this period of the year.<br /> 13. Ri = (n+1)/r (where n is the length of the record) and r is the rank of the flood in question. In the Ashnola River case Ri = (65+1)/2 = 33. The probability of such a flood next year is 1/Ri, or 1/33 which is 0.03 or 3%.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter14"></a><strong>Chapter 14</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Porosity is the proportion of open space (space that can be filled with water), within a rock or unconsolidated sediment. Permeability is an expression of the ease with which water will flow through that material.<br /> 2. Clay deposits have low permeability because of the small size of the clay fragments. Water is tightly held to the grains by surface tension, and in the very small spaces between grains in clay there is virtually no water that is not able to flow.<br /> 3. From least to most permeable: unfractured gneiss, mudstone, sandstone, fractured granite, limestone in a karst region.<br /> 4. (a) Sue’s well accesses an unconfined aquifer with low permeability. (b) Frank’s well accesses a confined aquifer with high permeability. (c) Sue’s low capacity aquifer acts as a (leaky) confining layer to Frank’s high capacity aquifer.<br /> 5. V = <em>K</em>i<br /> i = the gradient which is the elevation difference (83-77 = 6 m) over the distance (70 m) = 0.09, therefore V = 0.003 * 0.09 = 0.00027 m/s<br /> 6. After a drop of 9 m (from 83 to 74 m), and assuming that the other well did not drop at all, the gradient direction will have changed and the groundwater should flow toward the well that now has a level of 74 m.<br /> 7. Governments have the responsibility to protect our resources and to do their best to make sure that individuals and industry can access the groundwater that they need. Without observation well networks governments will have no independent information on how water levels are changing, and will be unable to make decisions on what might need to be done to ensure an adequate water supply for all.<br /> 8. Natural groundwater contamination originates from the natural reactions between the groundwater and the aquifer minerals. Anthropogenic groundwater contamination typically comes from human-sourced chemicals at or near to surface that are allowed to leak into the aquifer.<br /> 9. Water travels faster through a highly permeable aquifer and thus can spread the contamination further than in a less permeable one.<br /> 10. Livestock wastes are rich in nitrogen compounds, and these most commonly lead to nitrate contamination within the groundwater. Livestock wastes may also contain pharmaceuticals, which could contaminate groundwater.<br /> 11. The mineral pyrite is most likely to be responsible for acid rock drainage.<br /> 12. The waste water in a septic field needs to percolate slowly through the ground in order for natural processes to break down the contaminants. If the permeability is too low the waste water could come to surface. If the permeability is too high it could contaminate groundwater.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter15"></a><strong>Chapter 15</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The shear force and normal force vectors are shown on the left-hand diagram:</p> <p><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/vectoris.png"><img width="500" height="171" class="alignnone wp-image-1526 size-full" alt="vectoris" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/vectoris-e1442871434768.png" /></a></p> <p>2. Based on the relative lengths of the arrows it appears that this material is stable, and unlikely to fail.<br /> 3. If the shear strength was reduced by 25% (right-hand diagram) the material would be much closer to failure, but the strength (based on the length of the arrows) still appears to be greater than the shear force.<br /> 4. <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/slope.png"><img width="500" height="157" class="alignnone wp-image-1527 size-full" alt="slope" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/slope-e1442871705723.png" /></a></p> <p>5. In moist sand the grains are each surrounded by an envelope of water, and the water envelopes overlap. The attractive surface tension of the water holds the grains together.<br /> 6. In a the material moves like a fluid (individual particles move independently). In a the mass moves as an intact unit, with little or no relative motion between grains or clasts.<br /> 7. If a large rock slide starts moving at a rate of several metres per second, the rock is very likely to break into smaller pieces. If the pieces are small and numerous enough that the material can flow, then it becomes a rock avalanche.<br /> 8. A debris flow is composed mostly of sand-sized and larger clasts, while a mudflow is composed mostly of sand-sized and smaller clasts.<br /> 9. Residents at risk from Mt. Rainier lahars need to know what the warnings mean and roughly how much time they have between receiving a warning and being in actual danger. They need to create a plan to exit their residence quickly, and they need to know which way to go to get to safety as efficiently as possible.<br /> 10. Some of the important factors include:</p> <ul><li>The steepness of the slope</li> <li>Any existing erosion processes happening at the base of the slope (e.g., wave or stream erosion)</li> <li>The nature of surface or shallow sub-surface drainage in the upper part of the slope, and any effects that the construction might have on the drainage</li> <li>The weight of the building (unless it is to be constructed in an excavation that represents more mass than the building itself)</li> </ul> <p><strong><a id="chapter16"></a><strong>Chapter 16</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The Cryogenian glaciations are called Snowball Earth because it is thought that freezing conditions affected the entire planet and that the oceans were frozen over, even at the equator.<br /> 2. The cooling from the end of the Paleocene until the Holocene was related to the formation of mountains including the Himalayas, the Rockies, and the Andes; the opening of the Drake Passage; the development of Antarctic Circumpolar Current; and the closing of the Isthmus of Panama.<br /> 3. The first glaciation of the Cenozoic took place in Antarctica during the Oligocene (around 30 Ma).<br /> 4. At the height of the last glaciation, the Laurentide Ice Sheet covered almost all of Canada and extended south into the United States as far as Wisconsin.<br /> 5. Continental glaciers flow from the areas where the ice is thickest (and therefore at the highest elevation) toward areas (at the margins) where the ice is thinnest. Ice thickness tends to be related to the rate of ice accumulation.<br /> 6. The equilibrium line represents the boundary between the area where ice is accumulating (typically at high elevations), and where it is being depleted (mostly by melting). Above the equilibrium line more snow accumulates in winter than can melt in summer so the glacier is always covered in snow. Below the equilibrium line the snow cover is lost by the end of summer.<br /> 7. Relatively cool summers are more important because that controls how much snow will melt in the summer. In many situations very cold winters are associated with less snow accumulation than just cold winters.<br /> 8. (a) The ice at the bottom of a glacier flows more slowly than that at the top. In fact if the glacier is frozen to its base the lowermost ice might not be moving at all. (b) The edges also flow more slowly than the middle because there is more friction there between the ice and the valley walls.<br /> 9. Basal sliding will take place when the bed of the glacier is warm enough for water to be liquid. The water will act as a lubricant to allow the ice to flow.<br /> 10. Glaciers carve U-shaped valleys because they are relatively wide (compared with rivers) and most of the erosion takes place at the base rather than the sides. A hanging valley forms where a tributary glacier joins a larger glacier and where the larger glacier has eroded a deeper valley.<br /> 11. There must be at least three cirques to form a horn. In most cases there wouldn’t be room for more than four.<br /> 12. A drumlin is relatively steep at the up-ice end and streamlined at the down-ice end. A roche moutonée is streamlined at the up-ice end and jagged at the down-ice end where plucking has taken place.<br /> 13. <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/Screen-Shot-2015-09-21-at-2.44.00-PM.png"><img width="500" height="213" class="alignnone wp-image-1528 size-full" alt="Image 1: Lodgement till, poorly stored, clay to boulders, no layering, large clasts not well rounded, no structures.

Drop stones are large clasts that are present with lacustrine or marine glacial sediments. They form when coarse material drops from melting icebergs.<br /> 15. Glaciofluvial sediments (sand or sand and gravel) are likely to be sufficiently permeable to make good aquifers.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter17"></a><strong>Chapter 17</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The size of waves are determined by the wind velocity, the length of time the wind blows in the approximately the same direction, and the area of water over which it blows.<br /> 2. Table 17.1 provides data for 56 and 74 km/h winds, and 65 km/h is half way between these two values. The listed values for duration and fetch are high enough for the sea to fully develop, so the simple answer would be that the wave amplitude and wavelength would also be approximately half way between the listed values: amplitude ~6 m, wavelength ~106 m.<br /> 3. Waves will start to feel” the bottom at around 50% of the wavelength, so at 50 m depth in this case. This will slow the waves down and also cause their amplitude to increase.<br /> 4. A longshore current is the movement of water parallel to the shore in the surface zone caused by waves approaching at an angle. Longshore drift is the movement of sediment parallel to the shoreline, caused partly by the longshore current and also by swash and backwash on the beach.<br /> 5. Wave energy is focused on the headland, with more wave energy vectors per length of coast than in the bays, and thus the headland is eroding faster than the bays on either side, leading to coastal straightening.<br /> <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/chapter17.png"><img width="400" height="307" class="alignnone wp-image-1529 size-full" alt="chapter17" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/chapter17-e1442872144697.png" /></a></p> <p>6. Rocky coasts are eroded by waves and that erosion is greatest within the surface zone. As stacks and arches are eventually eroded away, a wave-cut platform is left.<br /> 7. The beach face is the relatively steep area of the beach between the low and high tide levels. This is also known as the foreshore or swash zone.<br /> 8. A spit can form where there is longshore drift and the geometry of the shoreline is such that a sand bar extends away from the shore.<br /> 9. The area of the Atlantic coast north of Massachusetts (including New Hampshire, Maine, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland plus all of the area inland) was glaciated during the Pleistocene and has since rebounded isostatically. This is all now relatively young rocky coast that is being actively eroded.<br /> 10. There has been approximately 125 m of eustatic sea-level rise since the last deglaciation, so the current sea level should be approximately 140 – 125 = 15 m lower than it was during glaciation. The dash-dot line marks present-day sea level. An uplifted coast like this should have uplifted wave-cut terraces and coastal waterfalls.<br /> <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/sea-level.png"><img width="500" height="118" class="alignnone wp-image-1530 size-full" alt="sea level" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/03/sea-level-e1442872483324.png" /></a></p> <p>11. Sediments would be trapped in the reservoir behind such a dam, and the water flowing through the dam would be sediment-free. Although there would be erosion of new sediments downstream from the dam, the water reaching the ocean at Richmond would have less sediment than it does now. This is likely to result in the beaches around Vancouver being starved of sediment, and they would gradually get smaller.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter18"></a><strong>Chapter 18</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Most of the sediments on continental shelves originate from clastic sediments derived from erosion on the continents. The shelves on the eastern coast of North America are wider than those along the west coast because there has been relatively recent (Cenozoic) tectonic activity on the west coast, while the east coast has been passive for about 180 million years.<br /> 2. Subduction zone trenches may be partly filled in areas where there is significant sediment input from rivers.<br /> 3. From bottom to top, oceanic crust is composed of gabbro, sheeted mafic dykes, and pillow basalts. In most areas it is also covered with varying amounts of sea-floor sediments and sedimentary rocks.<br /> 4. The oldest sea floor in the Indian Ocean is in the order of 150 Ma. There is oceanic crust of this age along the western margin of Africa, and adjacent to the northwestern part of Australia.<br /> 5. Coarse terrigenous sediments accumulate mostly where major rivers enter the sea, but they are only washed a few kilometres out to sea (at most) because there isn’t enough river velocity left to move them farther. Some of those sediments are moved many kilometres farther out to sea during flows of turbidity currents. Clay, on the other hand, can stay in suspension for centuries, and during that time can be dispersed well out into the ocean.<br /> 6. Carbonate sediments will accumulate on the sea floor wherever there is significant abundance of carbonate-shelled organisms near to surface, and where the ocean is shallower than the depth at which carbonate becomes soluble (the carbonate compensation depth). In these areas there is typically much more carbonate than clay present, so the sediments look carbonate-rich, even though there is clay there.<br /> 7. Carbonate sediments are absent from the deepest parts of the oceans because carbonate minerals are soluble below about 4,000 m depth, so carbonate fragments that settle to that depth dissolve back into the water.<br /> 8. The carbon in sea-floor methane hydrates is derived from the bacterial breakdown of organic matter at greater depth in the sediment pile.<br /> 9. The tropical parts of the oceans are saltiest because the rate of evaporation is highest. The Mediterranean and Red Seas are saltier than the open ocean.<br /> 10. Salty water is transported north by the Gulf Stream and gradually cools. As it cools it remains relatively salty and this cool salty is denser than either cold very fresh water or warm very salty water.</p> <p>11. The relatively dense water in the north Atlantic sinks to become North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW), and gradually moves back towards the south.<br /> 12.The open-ocean currents have the effect of moderating Earth’s surface temperature because warm tropical water is moved toward the poles, and cold polar water is moved toward the tropics.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter19"></a><strong>Chapter 19</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The greenhouse gases (GHG) vibrate at frequencies that are similar to those of infrared (IR) radiation. When IR radiation impinges on a GHG molecule, the molecule’s vibrational energy is enhanced and the radiation energy is converted into heat, which is trapped within the atmosphere.<br /> 2. The combustion of fossil fuels releases CO<sub>2</sub> that was previously stored in the crust. The resulting increase in atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> leads to a temperature increase. As the temperature increases, the solubility of CO<sub>2</sub> in the ocean decreases and additional CO<sub>2</sub> is released by the ocean, resulting in even higher atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> levels and higher temperatures.<br /> 3. Gondwana was situated over the South Pole for much of the Paleozoic and became glaciated during the Ordovician (Andean-Saharan Glaciation) and again during the Permian (Karoo Glaciation). These glaciations cooled the entire planet during these periods.<br /> 4. From a climate perspective, the two important volcanic gases are SO<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>. SO<sub>2</sub> is converted to sulphate aerosols which block sunlight and can lead to short-term cooling (years). CO<sub>2</sub> can lead to warming, but only in situations where there is an elevated level of volcanism over at least thousands of years.<br /> 5. We use 65° for estimating the glaciation potential of orbital variations because glaciers are most likely to form at high latitudes. We use 65° N rather than 65° S because for more than 50 million years the continents have been concentrated in the northern hemisphere. We use July instead of January because for glaciers to grow it’s more important to have cool summers than cold winters.<br /> 6. If the major currents in the oceans were to slow down or stop, the tropics would get hotter and the high-latitude areas would get colder, leading to expansion of glaciers and sea ice. The various feedbacks (e.g., higher albedo because of increased ice cover) would result in an overall cooler climate.<br /> 7. The main climate implication of the melting and breakdown of permafrost is that carbon that was trapped in the frozen ground will be released and then converted to CO<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub>, leading to more warming.<br /> 8. Sea-floor methane hydrates are stable because the deep ocean water is cold. In order for the hydrates to become unstable, warmth from the upper layers of the ocean has to be transferred to depth.<br /> 9. A significant part of our GHG emissions take place during because of the (formerly) intentional and (presently) unavoidable release of natural gas (CH<sub>4</sub>) during the extraction of oil and gas. Some is lost during transportation — for example when pipelines leak — and some is consumed during transportation — for example to pressurize pipelines or to power tanker trains. GHGs are also leaked to the atmosphere during the routine refuelling and operation of motor vehicles.<br /> 10. The rise of sea level results from a combination of melting glaciers and thermal expansion of the ocean water. Both of these large systems are slow to respond to the warming climate. For example it takes a long time for warm surface water to be transferred to depth in the ocean or for heat to be transferred to depth in a glacier. Even if we stabilized the GHG levels in the atmosphere today, the climate would continue to warm for approximately another 100 years, and sea level would continue to rise for much longer than that.<br /> 11. West Nile virus is carried by birds and is transmitted to humans by certain species of mosquitoes. The range and abundance of those mosquitoes is partly controlled by climate change, especially by warm winters. Sufficiently warm winters are increasingly common in the northern United States and southern Canada.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter20"></a><strong>Chapter 20</strong></strong></p> <p>1. Some of the components of a compact fluorescent lightbulb (and the resources used to make one) are as follows:</p> <ul><li>Steel (iron, carbon from coal plus some manganese, nickel, chromium, molybdenum)</li> <li>Plastic housing (petroleum)</li> <li>Glass coil (silica from sand, plus minor amounts of sodium, calcium, and magnesium)</li> <li>Copper conductors, lead solder, and basal contact</li> <li>Silica (sand), plastics (petroleum), ceramics (clay), aluminum, gold, copper, etc. in the electronics</li> <li>Mercury inside the tube (less than 5 mg)</li> </ul> <p>2. Nickel deposits form within mafic and ultramafic igneous bodies because the original magma have relatively high nickel levels to begin with, while intermediate or felsic magma have low levels.<br /> 3. The “smoke” in a black smoker is composed of tiny crystals of sulphide minerals. If those include significant quantities of ore minerals like chalcopyrite (CuFeS<sub>2</sub>), sphalerite (ZnS), and galena (PbS), a VMS deposit could form during this process.<br /> 4. A porphyry deposit is situated in the rock around an igneous pluton that has intruded to a relatively high level in the crust (and hence is porphyritic), and they form at least in part from fluids released by the magma. Epigenetic gold deposits may be formed from the same or similar fluids, but are situated at a greater distance from the pluton/<br /> 5. Ferrous iron (Fe<sup>2+</sup>) is soluble in water with a low oxidation potential, and gets converted to insoluble ferric iron (Fe<sup>3+</sup>) when the water becomes oxidized. The opposite situation happens with uranium. Uranyl uranium (U<sup>6+</sup>) is soluble under oxidizing conditions, but when the water in which it is dissolved encounters reducing conditions the uranium is converted to the insoluble uranous ion (U<sup>4+</sup>).<br /> 6. It is common for the upper part of a kimberlite to be mined using an open pit (in this case around 500 m wide and up to 500 m deep), and for the lower part to be mined underground.<br /> 7. Pyrite (FeS<sub>2</sub>) is typically responsible for acid rock drainage around mine sites, and it is very common for pyrite to form within the rock at the same time that other metal sulphides (e.g., chalcopyrite) are forming.<br /> 8. Glaciofluvial gravels are typically relatively well sorted, and may include clasts ranging in size from coarse sand to pebbles. Till, on the other hand, tends to be poorly sorted and may have clasts ranging from clay to boulders. More processing would be needed to separate the required size ranges, and because till tends to be relatively hard and strong, this would require a lot of effort.<br /> 9. During the manufacture of CaO limestone is heated and CO<sub>2</sub> is released to the atmosphere, adding to the greenhouse effect. The energy required for this process typically comes from fossil fuels (e.g., natural gas) and the combustion also releases CO<sub>2</sub>.<br /> 10. Some important evaporite minerals include halite (NaCl), sylvite (KCl), and gypsum (CaSO<sub>4</sub>.2H<sub>2</sub>O).<br /> 11. The 15 m of organic matter required to make 1.5 m of coal, is equivalent to 15,000 mm, and if the organic matter accumulates at 1 mm/y that would require 15,000 years. That organic matter would have to remain submerged in oxygen-poor water for at least that length of time.<br /> 12. Petroleum source rocks must have a significant component of organic matter, and then need to be buried to at least 2,500 m depth so that the organic matter can be converted to oil or gas. Reservoir rocks must be both porous and permeable, so that the petroleum liquids can be extracted, and should also take the form of a trap (e.g., an anticline) and capped with impermeable rock.<br /> 13. The optimum depth for the generation of oil from buried organic matter is 2,500 to 3,500 m.<br /> 14. Shale gas is an unconventional reserve because shale is not permeable enough to allow the gas to be extracted. The rock has to be fractured (fracked) to allow recovery. Fracking involves the use of vast amounts of water, and there is the potential that the fracking fluids can contaminate freshwater aquifers.<br /> 15. Kimberlite indicator minerals are much more abundant than diamonds within kimberlites, and so they can typically be detected further away from the kimberlite source, and over a much wider area.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter21"></a><strong>Chapter 21</strong></strong></p> <p>1. The oldest parts of Laurentia are the Slave and Superior Provinces. Both have rocks that are in the order of 4 Ga.<br /> 2. The regions A through E are A-the Cordilleran Fold Belt, B-the Western Canada Sedimentary Basin, C-the Canadian Shield, D-the Innuitian Fold Belt, and E-the Appalachian Fold Belt.<br /> 3. Pearya collided with North America to form the Innuitian fold belt during the Devonian.<br /> 4. The ancient sedimentary rocks of the Athabasca and Thelon Basins were deposited on the stable Canadian Shield and were never involved in tectonic processes; nor were they buried deeply enough to be metamorphosed.<br /> 5. Ultramafic magma has to be very hot to be liquid, and while Earth’s interior was hot enough during the Archean, it is no longer hot enough.<br /> 6. There are several reasons why the preservation is so good in the Burgess Shale: the rock is very fine grained so details are well defined; the dead organisms accumulated in a lifeless anoxic basin so they were not oxidized, scavenged, or broken down by bacteria while they were being fossilized; although some of the surrounding rocks are weakly metamorphosed, the Burgess Shale was protected from squeezing by adjacent strong limestone.<br /> 7. The Western Canada Sedimentary Basin was filled with marine water during pre-Prairie Evaporite times and Winnipegosis carbonate was deposited. It slowly dried out to produce the evaporite beds, but was later re-filled, leading to the deposition of Dawson Bay carbonate. The isolation of the basin during Prairie Evaporite times might have been due to a drop in sea level or tectonic uplift. A change to a dryer climate may also have been a factor.<br /> 8. The rocks of the Intermontane Superterrane have fossils that are indicative of southern hemisphere deposition, and also have magnetic inclinations that imply an origin south of the equator.<br /> 9. Terrane accretion on the west coast led to formation of the Rocky Mountains. The rapid erosion of these mountains provided a source for accumulation of sediments within the WCSB.<br /> 10. The western edge of the WCSB was pushed down by the mass of the Rocky Mountains toward the end of the Mesozoic, and thus can be thought of as a foreland basin.<br /> 11. The likely order is Yukon-Tanana, Quesnel, Cache Creek, and Stikine, although it is also possible that these terranes were assembled as one unit prior to reaching North America.<br /> 12. Nanaimo Group sedimentary rocks were forced inland and up to relatively high elevations on Vancouver Island when the accretion of the Pacific Rim and Crescent Terranes pushed Vancouver Island closer to the mainland.<br /> 13. The Paskapoo Formation becomes thinner toward the northeast because the foreland basin gets shallower in that direction, and also because the source of the sediments is the Rocky Mountains, situated along the southeastern edge of the basin.</p> <p><strong><a id="chapter22"></a><strong>Chapter 22</strong></strong></p> <p>1. To see an event, light from that event must reach our eyes. Light travels very quickly (about 300,000,000 m/s), but the universe is very, very large. Depending on how far away the event was, it could take billions of years for light to travel from the event to our eyes so we can see it. Astronomers take advantage of this fact to view the universe’s past.<br /> 2. B is the spectrum from the Andromeda galaxy. We know that one spectrum represents the Sun, which is not moving toward or away from us. (Our orbit is not perfectly circular, but the small eccentricity is not a factor in this comparison.) We know that the Andromeda galaxy is on a collision course with us, so it is the exception to the rule that galaxies are moving away from us, and their light is red-shifted. That means the spectrum B which is shifted furthest to the left (blue-shifted) is Andromeda, and spectrum A which is furthest to the right (red-shifted) is a galaxy moving away from us. That means C is the Sun.</p> <div class="wp-caption alignnone" id="attachment_1533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1533" style="width: 331px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/geology/wp-content/uploads/sites/110/2015/09/spectra.png"><img width="331" height="235" class="size-full wp-image-1533" alt="Spectra for the sun and two galaxies.

In contrast, terrestrial planets have heavier elements, especially silica, iron, magnesium, and nickel, that had yet to be manufactured by stars. Those elements were not present in sufficient abundance to form terrestrial planets until much later.<br /> 4. Closest to the sun we find the small, rocky, terrestrial planets with metal cores. Further out are the gas giant planets, which are the largest in the solar system. They consist mostly of hydrogen, and have cores of rock and ice. Beyond the gas giant planets are the ice giant planets, which are next largest. They have a mantle of ice (not just water ice but ammonia and methane ice), and a rocky core. Smaller objects in the solar system include rocky bodies within the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, and bodies of ice and dust in the Kuiper belt and Oort cloud beyond Neptune.<br /> 5. The frost line marks the distance from the Sun beyond which temperatures were cool enough to allow ice to form. This helps to explain why the terrestrial planets are closer to the Sun, and the Jovian and ice giant planets farther away. Mineral grains could solidify and begin to accrete closer to the Sun, forming terrestrial planets, because they have higher melting points. In contrast, water vapour, methane, and ammonia had to be farther from the Sun before they could freeze and begin to accrete.<br /> 6. The objects are comets, and two places to find large numbers of comets in the solar system are the Oort cloud and the Kuiper belt. The bright dot the comets have noticed is the sun, and the adventurous comet returns displaying the consequences of the Sun’s energy blasting gases and dust from its surface.<br /> 7. Planets are defined as having cleared their orbits of debris. Pluto is located within the Kuiper belt, so it shares its orbit with other objects. There are two other criteria in the definition of a planet: planets in our solar system must orbit the Sun, and they must have a spherical shape. Pluto satisfies both these criteria, but sadly the people deciding whether or not Pluto should be a planet are not amenable to a “best two out of three” compromise.<br /> 8. Differentiation is the separation of materials within a planet such that dense materials sink to the core, and lighter materials float upward. In Earth’s case, the denser materials are iron and nickel, and the lighter materials are silicate minerals. In order for differentiation to happen, the entire planet must be melted.<br /> 9. Thus far it appears that our solar system is unique compared to other planetary systems we have observed. In particular, some other planetary systems have gas giant planets very close to their star. The fact that we have terrestrial planets close to the Sun makes sense in terms of the frost line, but it does not seem to be a hard-and-fast rule in other planetary systems. Therefore, we can’t conclude from Kepler-452b’s position alone that it is a terrestrial planet.<br /> 10. The rules to the accretion game mean that there are many complex interactions, so even a small difference in the starting conditions or in how the game goes in the beginning could have major implications in the end. For that reason, we shouldn’t expect to find a planetary system that matches ours in every minute detail. However, just because we haven’t found a similar planetary system does not mean one does not exist. Our planet-finding methods are biased toward discovering large planets orbiting close to their stars, whereas our solar system has small planets close to the Sun and larger ones farther away. That doesn’t mean our methods won’t eventually turn up a system like ours, just that they are more likely to turn up systems that are different.</p> </div></div>

Garibaldi to be able to accurately define the locations and depths of earthquakes around the volcano. So the first project would be to establish about 5 additional seismic stations in the Squamish region. They don’t have to be right on the mountain, but can be placed near to existing roads and highways in the area. They need to be secured to bedrock. Every effort should be made to have them located on all sides of the mountain. The second project would be to establish some means of measuring deformation of the mountain itself. This could be done with tiltmeters or GPS stations, but GPS would be better. The GPS receivers have to be placed on the flanks of the mountain, and they also have to be installed right on bedrock. That could be a real challenge in winter or spring, when there is lots of snow. While this work is going on, we should charter a helicopter to fly around the mountain to see if there is any sign of eruptive activity or melting snow, and to look for convenient places to install GPS stations. We may want to land in a few different places.</em></p> <p><em>There isn’t a lot that we can say to the public at this stage, except that this sudden increase in seismic activity could mean that Garibaldi is getting ready to erupt, that the Geological Survey and all emergency measures organizations are working together on it, and that residents of the Squamish area, and anyone using highway 99, should keep listening to local radio stations for further updates. We could also establish a system to send out alerts via text message.</em></p> <p><strong>4.7 Volcanoes down under </strong>– We <em>would expect to see composite volcanoes on the North Island, some 200 to 300 km inland (northwest) from the Kermadec Trench, and within the ocean along the same trend to the northeast of NZ. There is also the potential for composite volcanism to the south of the South Island, east of the Macquarrie fault zone, although there appears to be some doubt about whether subduction is actually taking place in this region.</em></p> <p><a></a><strong>Chapter 5</strong></p> <p><strong>5.1 Mechanical weathering </strong>– see below</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1122" style="width: 300px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/07/ex5-1.png"><img class="wp-image-1122 size-medium" alt="" src="https://opentextbc.ca/physicalgeologyearle/wp-content/uploads/sites/145/2016/07/ex5-1-300x138.png" width="300" height="138" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Examples of mechanical weathering [SE]</div></div> <p><strong>5.2 Chemical weathering </strong></p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Chemical change</strong></td> <td><strong>Process</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyrite to hematite</td> <td><em>oxidation</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Calcite to calcium and bicarbonate ions</td> <td><em>dissolution</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Feldspar to clay</td> <td><em>hydrolysis</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Olivine to serpentine</td> <td><em>hydrolysis</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Pyroxene to iron oxide</td> <td><em>oxidation</em></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>5.3 Describe the weathering origins of sands</strong></p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Sand description</strong></td> <td><strong>Possible processes</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Fragments of coral etc. from a shallow water area near to a reef in Belize</td> <td><em>Reefs are constantly being eroded by ocean waves, and the fragments are washed inshore by currents and then further eroded by wave action.</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Angular quartz and rock fragments from a glacial stream deposit near Osoyoos</td> <td><em>Quartz-bearing rocks have been eroded and transported by a glacier.
