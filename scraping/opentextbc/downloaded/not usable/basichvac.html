Using Ohm’s law we can say:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=1%5Ctext%7B%20A%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%5Ctext%7B%20V%7D%7D%7B1%5Ctext%7B%20ohm%7D%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="1\text{ A}=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{1\text{ ohm}}" title="1\text{ A}=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{1\text{ ohm}}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <p>Let’s say this represents a tank with a wide hose. The amount of water in the tank is defined as 1 volt, and the “narrowness” (resistance to flow) of the hose is defined as 1 ohm. Using Ohm’s law, this gives us a flow (current) of 1 amp.</p> <p>Using this analogy, let’s now look at a tank with a narrow hose. Because the hose is narrower, its resistance to flow is higher. Let’s define this resistance as 2 ohms. The amount of water in the tank is the same as the other tank, so, using Ohm’s law, our equation for the tank with the narrow hose is:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=%3F%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%5Ctext%7B%20V%7D%7D%7B2%5Ctext%7B%20ohms%7D%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="?=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{2\text{ ohms}}" title="?=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{2\text{ ohms}}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <p>But what is the current? Because the resistance is greater and the voltage is the same, this gives us a current value of 0.5 amps:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=0.5%5Ctext%7B%20A%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B1%5Ctext%7B%20V%7D%7D%7B2%5Ctext%7B%20ohms%7D%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="0.5\text{ A}=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{2\text{ ohms}}" title="0.5\text{ A}=\dfrac{1\text{ V}}{2\text{ ohms}}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <h1>Watt’s Law</h1> <p>Combining the elements of <strong><span class="glossary-term">voltage</span></strong>, <strong><span class="glossary-term">current</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="glossary-term">power</span></strong>, named after James Watt, Watt’s Law is defined as the following formula:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=%5Ctext%7BP%7D%3D%5Ctext%7BE%7D%20%2A%20%5Ctext%7BI%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="\text{P}=\text{E} * \text{I}" title="\text{P}=\text{E} * \text{I}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <p>Where:</p> <ul><li>P = Power in watts</li> <li>E = Voltage in volts</li> <li>I = Current in amps</li> </ul> <p>Electric <strong><span class="glossary-term">power</span></strong> is the rate at which energy is transferred. It’s measured in terms of joules per second (J/s). One joule of work done every second means that power is dissipated at a rate equal to one <strong><span class="glossary-term">watt (W)</span></strong>.</p> <p>Given the few basic electricity terms we know, how could we calculate power in a circuit?</p> <p>Well, we have a standard measurement involving electromotive force, also know as <strong><span class="glossary-term">voltage (E)</span></strong>.</p> <p>Current, another of our favourite electrical terms, measures charge flow over time in terms of the <strong><span class="glossary-term">ampere (A)</span></strong>, which equals 1 coulomb per second (C/s). Put the two together, and what do we get? Power!</p> <p>To calculate the power of any particular component in a circuit, multiply the voltage drop across it by the current running through it.</p> <p>For instance, if current flows at a rate of 10 amps while the available voltage is 10 volts, then the circuit dissipates power at a rate of 100W.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=100%5Ctext%7B%20W%7D%3D10%5Ctext%7B%20V%7D%20%2A%2010%5Ctext%7B%20A%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="100\text{ W}=10\text{ V} * 10\text{ A}" title="100\text{ W}=10\text{ V} * 10\text{ A}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <h3>Text Attributions</h3> <ul><li>This chapter was adapted from “<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/ohm-and-watt/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/ohm-and-watt/">Ohm’s Law and Watt’s Law</a>” in <em>Basic Motor Control</em> by Chad Flinn and Aaron Lee, which is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.

As such the motor starts to draw very high values of <strong><span class="glossary-term">current</span></strong>. This current creates a magnetic field that causes the motor shaft to spin, and that spinning action creates a counter-EMF (CEMF), which limits the current to its normal running value.</p> <p>The initial high value of current is called <strong><span class="glossary-term">inrush current</span></strong> and can cause severe line disturbances and nuisance tripping if <strong><span class="glossary-term">fuses</span></strong> and <strong><span class="glossary-term">circuit breakers</span></strong> are not sized accordingly.</p> <h1>Overload</h1> <p>The term “<strong><span class="glossary-term">overload</span></strong>” describes a moderate and gradual rise in the value of current over a relatively long period of time. It is caused by excessive amounts of current drawn by a motor, which may be as high as six times the rated current. This is caused by too much load on a motor. Systems are protected by <strong><span class="glossary-term">overload protection relays</span></strong>. While overloads are allowed for a short time (usually minutes), prolonged overloads will use thermal action to cause a protective device to trip.</p> <h1>Overcurrent</h1> <p>The term “<strong><span class="glossary-term">overcurrent</span></strong>” (sometimes called a short circuit or a ground fault) describes a sharp and fast rise in current over a very short period of time (fractions of a second). Circuits and equipment are protected from overcurrent situations by <strong><span class="glossary-term">fuses</span></strong> or <strong><span class="glossary-term">circuit breakers</span></strong>.</p> <p>During a short circuit the value of current is far greater than the nominal line current and can indeed be anywhere from six times to many hundreds of times greater the normal rated current value of circuit.</p> <p>There are several causes of overcurrent situations. For example, when a bolted fault occurs—either a line to ground or a line to line fault. This causes a very large value of current to be drawn because of the inversely proportional relationship between the <strong><span class="glossary-term">resistance</span></strong> of a circuit and the current that is drawn.</p> <p>Another less intuitive cause of short circuits is when an induction motor starts. When a three-phase induction motor is first energized, the stator windings consist of a very low resistance path. This draws a very large inrush current which is indistinguishable from a standard short circuit, except that it quickly drops down to the rated value of current drawn by the motor. This is due to the CEMF (counter-electromotive force) developed by the rotating shaft of the motor. When the motor is spinning, a CEMF limits the current to safe values. When the motor is not spinning, a very large value of current is drawn from the source. This current is sometimes called <strong><span class="glossary-term">locked-rotor current</span></strong>, and motor starters and <strong><span class="glossary-term">overcurrent devices</span></strong> must be rated to safely handle and interrupt&nbsp; this value of current.</p> <h2>Effects of short circuits</h2> <p>Overcurrents are responsible for two main negative effects:</p> <ul><li>Thermal energy: High values of current will create large amounts of heat, which can damage equipment and wires. Thermal energy can be expressed by the formula: I<sup>2</sup>t (current squared multiplied by time) meaning that the longer the fault persists, the greater the potential thermal damage.</li> <li>Mechanical forces: Large fault currents can create powerful magnetic fields, and exert huge magnetic stress on busbars and equipment, sometimes warping them out of shape and creating new problems in the process.</li> </ul> <p>Large values of fault current can cause severe damage to circuits and equipment, so overcurrent protective devices must act very quickly to clear the fault. There are two main categories of overcurrent protective devices: <strong><span class="glossary-term">fuses</span></strong> and <strong><span class="glossary-term">circuit breakers</span></strong>.</p> <h3>Text Attributions</h3> <ul><li>This chapter was adapted from “<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/overload-and-over-current-protection/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/overload-and-over-current-protection/">Overload and Overcurrent Protection</a>” in <em>Basic Motor Control</em> by Chad Flinn and Aaron Lee, which is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.

They use thermal action and a bi-metallic strip to protect from overload conditions, and a magnetic sensing coil to protect against overcurrent situations. The main advantage that circuit breakers have over fuses is that they are re-settable.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-25" style="width: 241px"><img class="wp-image-492" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/03/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-252x300-1.jpg" alt="Three fuses of three different sizes." width="241" height="287" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Examples of common fuses</div></div> <p>A <strong><span class="glossary-term">fuse</span></strong> is a simple device that protects the conductors and equipment of a circuit from damage due to higher than normal fault values. It is designed to be the weakest link in a circuit. It is an insulated tube containing a strip of conductive metal (fuse-link) that has a lower melting point than either copper or aluminum. The fuse link has narrow, resistive segments that concentrate the current and cause the temperature at those points to rise.</p> <p>During a short circuit the fuse elements burn open in just a fraction of a second. The higher the values of fault current, the faster the fuse will react. In an overload situation, the fuse elements can take many seconds or even minutes before thermal actions cause the fuse link to melt open.</p> <p>Fuses come in two categories: Fast-acting fuses (Type P) and time-delay fuses (Type D). Fuses used in motor circuits have to withstand the intense inrush current when the motor is first started, and so we install time-delay fuses, also known as “dual-element fuses” in those circuits.</p> <h1>Common Ratings</h1> <p>All overcurrent devices must be operated within their rated values. Three of the most important ratings are <strong><span class="glossary-term">voltage</span></strong>, <strong><span class="glossary-term">current</span></strong>, and <strong><span class="glossary-term">interrupting capacity</span></strong>.</p> <h2>Voltage rating</h2> <p>Fuses and circuit breakers must be rated for at least the value of the <strong><span class="glossary-term">voltage</span></strong> of the circuit they are designed to protect.</p> <p>When a fuse or circuit breaker interrupts a fault current, it must safely extinguish the arc and prevent it from reestablishing itself. Therefore, the <strong><span class="glossary-term">voltage rating</span></strong> of a fuse or circuit breaker must be equal to or greater than the system voltage.</p> <p>For example, a fuse rated at 240V RMS will be acceptable for use in a 120V circuit. However, it would exceed the fuse’s voltage rating to use it in a 600V circuit.</p> <h2>Continuous-duty rating</h2> <p><strong><span class="glossary-term">Continuous-duty rating</span></strong> describes the maximum rated value of RMS current that the overcurrent device is designed to handle on a continuous basis without tripping. Generally speaking, the <strong><span class="glossary-term">ampere</span></strong> rating of the fuse or breaker should not exceed the current carrying capacity of the circuit, but there are exceptions, such as certain motor circuits.</p> <p>Unless otherwise marked, the continuous-duty rating of fuses and circuit breakers is 80% of their marked ampere value.&nbsp; This means that a standard 15 amp circuit breaker is generally designed for use in a maximum 12 amp circuit.</p> <h2>Interrupting capacity</h2> <p>When a short circuit or ground fault occurs, the circuit resistance drops to effectively zero <strong><span class="glossary-term">ohms</span></strong>, causing very large values of current to flow. This extremely fast rise in fault current can cause damage to wires and equipment through overheating and must be extinguished as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The <strong><span class="glossary-term">interrupting-capacity (IC) rating</span></strong> of an overcurrent device is the maximum fault current that the device can interrupt without damage to itself. Most circuit breakers and fuses have an IC rating of 10,000 amps.</p> <p>For systems capable of larger fault currents, high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuses can interrupt currents up to 200,000 amps by using arc-quenching fillers such as silica sand to help interrupt the fault current.</p> <h3>Text Attributions</h3> <ul><li>This chapter was adapted from “<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/overload-and-over-current-protection/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/overload-and-over-current-protection/">Overload and Overcurrent Protection</a>” in <em>Basic Motor Control</em> by Chad Flinn and Aaron Lee, which is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.

They require only two wires: one for power to go in and the other is a return path for current to go out. These are often called Line 1 and Line 2, or Line 1 and Neutral.

Each of these conductors are connected to a three-phase load, like a three-phase motor.</p> <p>When in operation, a balanced three-phase load (such as a motor) has each of its three line’s current values cancel each other out, and so it does not require a return conductor.

Imagine that you are at home, heating something in the microwave (perhaps a burrito) when all of a sudden all of the lights go out. But not just the lights, the microwave and every electrical device not powered by a battery is dead.</p> <p>Perhaps a tree has fallen across some power lines? Regardless of the cause, the effect is the same: the power is out. This is a common and annoying experience for us all, and often there is nothing to do but light some candles, read a book, and wait.</p> <p>How do we know when the power has been restored? All of a sudden all the lights come back on, and there’s a beep from the microwave letting you know that the clock needs to be reset.</p> <p>The lights are an example of low-voltage release (LVR). The <strong><span class="glossary-term">switches</span></strong> that control the lights were closed when the power went out, stayed closed during the power outage (the period of “low voltage”), and when the power was restored, the switches were all still in their “ON” position. The load was “released” after the period of “low-voltage.”</p> <p>Low-voltage release (LVR) is very useful for circuits where re-energization after a brief or temporary loss of power is safe and desirable. Some examples include lighting circuits, sump pumps, refrigeration circuits, and ventilation circuits. These are examples of circuits where their failure to re-energize after a power disruption could lead to damage of property (sump pump) or endangerment of safety (parkade ventilation).</p> <p>The microwave was an example of low-voltage protection (LVP). The timer controlling the microwave shut off when the power went out, and when the power returned, the <strong><span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span></strong> of the microwave waited for further input from a human operator.</p> <p>Low-voltage protection (LVP) is desirable when the sudden activation of a machine or other electrical load could cause damage or injury. Some examples would include any rotating machinery (table-saws, lathes) or moving conveyor belts. These are examples of circuits where the sudden re-energization could surprise or injure a person working nearby.</p> <p>There are many ways that circuits can be equipped with either low-voltage release (LVR) or low-voltage protection (LVP), but two of the simplest are with <strong><span class="glossary-term">two-wire</span> </strong>and <strong><span class="glossary-term">three-wire control circuits</span></strong> respectively.</p> <p>As a rule, if a circuit uses a magnetic contactor and a holding contact, it will provide low-voltage protection (LVP).</p> <p>If it uses maintained contacts, then it most likely provides low-voltage release (LVR).</p> <h3>Text Attributions</h3> <ul><li>This chapter was adapted from “<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/lvr-lvp/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/chapter/lvr-lvp/">Low-Voltage Release vs. Low-Voltage Protection</a>” in <em>Basic Motor Control</em> by Chad Flinn and Aaron Lee, which is under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.

The energy required to heat a space or a house comes from either the burning of natural gas, or it comes from electric heating loads. The method of distributing heat throughout a building can also vary, depending on the medium used to transport the heat. Usually forced air or water is used, though some heating loads, such as baseboard heaters, rely on passive heat dissipation.</p> <p>Control of heating loads requires temperature sensitive switches, called thermostats, which can either directly, or indirectly control the heating equipment.</p>

As a rule, we place our heaters, either baseboard heaters or air vents, near the outside of rooms and near windows and other areas of high heat loss. For the most effective heating of a room, thermostats should be installed on the opposite wall, or as far away as possible from a heat source.</p> <p>If the thermostat was installed directly above the heater, for example, it would sense a high temperature and switch the load off long before the room heated up to a desirable level. By installing it on the opposite wall, we ensure the heat has to travel through the whole room before the sensor opens the circuit, providing more balanced heating.</p> <p>Some thermostats will have the temperature sensitive portion of their apparatus installed remotely from their electrical contacts. This type of thermostat is commonly used for in-floor heating and certain industrial processes, where temperature monitoring equipment is impractical to install.</p>

This is why <strong><span class="glossary-term">low-voltage control circuits</span></strong> are favoured for central heating units. Low voltage thermostats are also more sensitive to changes in heat than line-voltage thermostats, and so can provide more precise control.</p> <p>When controlling a single large heating unit, such as a <strong><span class="glossary-term">central gas furnace</span></strong> or <strong><span class="glossary-term">electric furnace</span></strong>, there is no zone control as with baseboard heaters; either the whole house is getting heated, or none of it is. A low-voltage thermostat installed in a central location, and powered by a <strong><span class="glossary-term">120 - 24V transformer</span></strong>, can senses the ambient temperature and be used to control a <span class="glossary-term"><strong>relay</strong></span> to deliver power to the heating load.</p> <p>By using an <strong><span class="glossary-term">extra-low-voltage</span></strong> source for the control circuit we get the benefit of lower cost and easier installation along with increased safety, allowing a simple two-wire low-voltage cable to be installed in an ideal location in the house. Because it is only meant to handle the control current and not the load current, low-voltage thermostats are highly responsive and can provide more accurate control than line-line voltage thermostats.</p> <p>Some models of low-voltage thermostats used to control central gas furnace or electric furnace loads incorporating heat exchanges and blowers, will have a small, series connected, resistive device called an <strong><span class="glossary-term">anticipator resistor</span></strong>. The purpose of this device is to fine tune the sensitivity of the thermostat and prevent overshoot of the desired room temperature.</p> <p>Low-voltage thermostats, fall into two general categories, some are simple temperature activated switches while others are more modern <span class="glossary-term"><strong>electronic thermostats</strong></span> incorporating solid-state circuitry and allowing for programmable behaviours such as 24-hour cycles, and weekday vs weekend scheduling.</p> <p>Electronic thermostats use semiconductor components for both temperature sensing and control-circuit switching.

The good news is that <strong><span class="glossary-term">in-floor heating</span></strong> exists to help ameliorate these situations.</p> <p>By installing resistive heating cables below the finished floor, such a tiled floor in a bathroom, we can eliminate the heat sapping characteristics of the cold tiles, however underfloor heating sets are not intended to be a source of heat for the room.</p> <p>Heating cables can also be installed below driveways and walkways for the purpose of melting ice or snow in the winter.

In contrast to an electric furnace, a gas fired furnace converts the stored chemical energy in methane rich <strong><span class="glossary-term">natural gas</span></strong> to produce heat. While natural gas is cleaner than other fossil fuels, it still emits carbon when consumed, and so it is a greenhouse gas emitter. Its chief benefit is that it is often a cheaper alternative to expensive electric heating bills.</p> <p>Natural gas is used to provide space heating by heating either air, in a <strong><span class="glossary-term">forced-air system</span></strong>, or water, in a <strong><span class="glossary-term">hydronic heating system</span></strong>. Both systems rely on either <strong><span class="glossary-term">pumps</span></strong> or <strong><span class="glossary-term">fans</span></strong> to push either the heated air or water throughout the building.</p> <h1>Basic Principle</h1> <p>A gas fired forced-air furnace operates on a similar principle as a central electric furnace. Both require a <strong><span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span></strong> to sense the temperature of the space to be heated, and a fan to circulate air throughout that space. The furnace is usually located in the basement or crawl space of a house.</p> <p>If the room temperature falls too low, the main thermostat clicks on and opens the main gas valve which allows the combustible gas to fill the <strong><span class="glossary-term">heat exchanger</span></strong>. The inflowing gas is ignited via a pilot light, direct spark ignition, or an electrically heated hot-surface igniter similar to a diesel engine glow plug. &nbsp;Once the temperature in the heat exchanger has risen to a sufficient level, a local thermostat or timer switch engages the <strong><span class="glossary-term">blower fan</span>.</strong></p> <p>An upper-limit safety thermostat is installed in the plenum chamber to disengage the main gas valve should the blower fan fail to engage, and the temperature rise too high.</p> <p>The blower fan pushes the heated air through the ducting system and the building, usually via floor registers. Since hot air rises, it is always more efficient to install heat registers as low as possible and near places of high ambient temperature loss, such as windows and exterior walls or doors. Return-air registers draw cooled air back down to the furnace and the heat exchanger to be warmed again.</p> <p>As the blower fan draws the return air, it pushes it through a filter before heating it again. This helps maintain healthy air quality levels in the building, and filters should be replaced regularly.</p> <p>If a hydronic heating system is used instead of a forced-air system, a pump will push the heated water to radiators throughout the building to dissipate their thermal energy.</p> <p>One of the by-products of combusting gasses to produce heat, is smoke, which needs to be vented safely away from the house. The heat exchanger keeps the toxic byproducts of combustion separate from the air that is circulated throughout the building. Most of the heat is transferred to the circulating air, but some still lost through exhaust. Older heat exchangers had an efficiency of roughly 50%, meaning half the heat produced was wasted up the chimney. Modern designs have improved efficiency to approximately 70% to 80%, and recent high-efficiency furnaces can achieve heat distribution efficiencies above 90%.</p>

It is for this reason that the valve is designed to automatically close if the flame should ever extinguish. To achieve this, a <strong><span class="glossary-term">thermocouple</span></strong> is used to keep the valve open.</p> <p>Spark ignition and electronic ignition, sometimes called a glow coil, are alternative methods of igniting the gas used for heating. All rely on the principle of instantly igniting the gas once the main gas valve opens.</p>

If the water did not move, it would quickly reach equilibrium with the room and no more heat transfer would occur. By constantly cycling fresh, warm water through the pipes, and carrying away the cooled water, an energy transfer can take place, with water as the <strong><span class="glossary-term">medium</span></strong> that carries the energy.</p> <p>This system would require an external heating source, such as a gas-fired boiler or an electric boiler to heat the water. Once the water has collected this stored thermal energy, it is then cycled through the system, transferring heat energy in the desired locations. Radiators are usually installed near windows and points of high heat loss to release the stored energy.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_73" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-73" style="width: 421px"><img class="wp-image-73" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system.png" alt="A hydronic heating system pumps cool water through a boiler, through a radiator, and back to the boiler to heat up again." width="421" height="342" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basichvac/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system.png 764w, https://opentextbc.ca/basichvac/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system-300x243.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basichvac/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system-65x53.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basichvac/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system-225x183.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basichvac/wp-content/uploads/sites/336/2021/02/Hydronic-heating-system-350x284.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-73">Hydronic heating system.</div></div>

Mechanical cooling is utilized for the large scale cooling of entire buildings, or it can be used to keep the inside of the fridge cold and allow for the long term storage and freezing of food.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term"><strong>Air conditioning</strong></span> units use the basic <strong><span class="glossary-term">Direct Expansion (DX)</span></strong> cooling cycle in a process that removes heat from one area where it is not desired, and transfers that heat to an area where it is quickly dissipated.

Examples include refrigerators and freezers, air conditioner units and heat pumps. Regardless of the scale of the cooling system, whether air conditioning a building or keeping the inside of your refrigerator cold, all cooling systems are governed by the first two laws of <strong><span class="glossary-term">thermodynamics</span></strong>:</p> <ol><li><strong><em>Energy</em></strong> <em>may be neither created nor destroyed, but may be <strong>changed</strong> from one form to another</em></li> </ol> <p>Accordingly, <strong><span class="glossary-term">thermal energy</span></strong> or heat may not be created to warm an area nor destroyed to cool an area. Instead we use heaters to convert either stored chemical energy (gas) or electrical energy into heat, or we use cooling systems to remove heat from a given area.</p> <ol start="2"><li><strong><em>Thermal energy</em></strong> <em>always flows spontaneously in the form of heat from regions of higher temperature to regions of lower temperature, increasing the entropy of the system. </em></li> </ol> <p>An object or area that is hotter than the ambient temperature surrounding it will naturally release heat until equilibrium is established and there is no longer a temperature gradient. A bowl of hot soup will cool to room temperature over time. Conversely, objects that are colder than the ambient temperature will absorb thermal energy until they reach ambient temperature. This fundamental relationship underlies the principle behind many styles of <strong><span class="glossary-term">mechanical cooling systems</span></strong>, including DX, or <strong><span class="glossary-term">direct expansion</span></strong> cooling.</p>

This device supplies the energy that drives the cooling system, and is usually a single-phase electrical motor load.</p> <p>The compressor drives the next most critical component, the refrigerant, throughout the system. The refrigerant must have the property of boiling below room temperature. There are several varieties of refrigerant in use today, each with their own unique properties, but all share the common trait of evaporating at low temperatures. It is the property of changing phase, i.e. boiling, at low temperatures, that allows the refrigerant to maximize its ability to absorb thermal energy from a room or area.</p> <p>The two components which facilitate the transfer of heat to or from the refrigerant are the evaporator located in the area to be cooled, and the condenser, located where heat may be dissipated, commonly outside of the building. The majority of the heat energy is dissipated in the condenser, and in order for heat transfer to occur, the air surrounding the condenser coil must be at a lower temperature than the refrigerant. This is why the compressor raises the temperature and pressure of the refrigerant, thus ensuring that there is sufficient heat gradient between the outside air and the refrigerant.</p> <p>Between the condenser and the evaporator is the expansion valve, which regulates the pressure of the refrigerant. By allowing the refrigerant to expand, we increase the <strong><span class="glossary-term">volume</span></strong> of space the gas can occupy, and thus lower the number of collisions that the atoms will have. This results in a lowering of kinetic thermal energy.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=%5Ctext%7BTemperature%7D%3D%5Cdfrac%7B%5Ctext%7BPressure%7D%7D%7B%5Ctext%7BVolume%7D%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="\text{Temperature}=\dfrac{\text{Pressure}}{\text{Volume}}" title="\text{Temperature}=\dfrac{\text{Pressure}}{\text{Volume}}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <p>Since the expansion valve lowers the pressure of the gas by allowing it to expand into the larger volume of the intake pipe feeding the evaporator, the refrigerant experiences a decrease in temperature. This is how we can actively make something colder than room temperature.</p> <p>Refrigerants are designed to have a boiling point low enough to evaporate and turn into a gas at room temperature. For heat to transfer there has to be a temperature difference between the room and the refrigerant. If the cold refrigerant now flows through the evaporator coils, and air blown across the evaporator coils is at a higher ambient temperature, the colder refrigerant will absorb the heat, or thermal energy from the air, which has the same effect as cooling that air.</p> <p>By constantly cycling additional cold refrigerant through the room, heat can be steadily removed from the desired area, and dissipated outside the building.</p>

It receives a <strong><em>low pressure, room temperature gas</em></strong>, and pumps the refrigerant through a valve into a much narrower diameter pipe and this restriction in volume, combined with the increased pressure of the refrigerant causes its temperature to rise rapidly. The refrigerant is a <strong><em>high temperature, high pressure</em></strong> gas as it is exiting the compressor valve.</p> <h1>The Condenser</h1> <p>As the refrigerant enters the <strong><span class="glossary-term">condenser</span> </strong>coil it is a <em><strong>high temperature</strong>, <strong>high pressure gas</strong></em>. The condenser coil has a large surface area that is exposed to the air. It will often be attached to a large metal grill to increase its available surface area, dissipating heat through conduction as well as convection. The refrigerant dissipates the thermal energy and condenses into a liquid as it moves through the coil. &nbsp;Most of the heat energy is dissipated at this stage, utilizing the <strong><span class="glossary-term">Second Law of Thermodynamics</span></strong> to transfer heat from the refrigerant to the surrounding&nbsp; air. A fan can be incorporated into the cooling system to help circulate air across the condenser coils and take heat away from the system. Condenser units are often installed outdoors on rooftops for convenient heat dissipation.</p> <h1>The Expansion Valve</h1> <p>This component regulates the flow of refrigerant from the high pressure/temperature side of the system and the low pressure/temperature side. As the refrigerant enters the expansion valve it is a <em><strong>high pressure, room temperature liquid</strong></em>, and as it expands into the larger area beyond the valve, its pressure, and thus its temperature drops dramatically. This is when the refrigerant is at its coldest, as a <em><strong>low pressure, low temperature liquid</strong></em>. The amount of refrigerant that the valve lets through is controlled by a diaphragm, which is connected to a capillary type thermal sensor filled with a separate refrigerant. The sensing bulb is attached to the exit line of the <strong><span class="glossary-term">evaporator</span></strong>. By sensing the temperature of the refrigerant as it leaves the evaporator, the expansion valve can let in more or less refrigerant at a given moment, thus raising or lowering the temperature of the refrigerant as it enters the evaporator.</p> <h1>The Evaporator</h1> <p>The evaporator coils are similar in design to the condenser coils but with the purpose of drawing heat from the surrounding air into the refrigerant. Again a large surface area helps to conduct heat from the air to the refrigerant. Fans can be used circulate the air and replace cooled air with warmer air. As the <em><strong>low pressure, low temperature liquid</strong></em> enters the evaporator coil and starts to absorb heat, it rapidly evaporates from a liquid to a gas. This phase shift draws energy from the surrounding air in the form of heat, and carries it away as the <em><strong>low pressure, room temperature gas</strong></em> is suctioned towards the compressor, where energy is added to drive the cycle again.</p>
