<div class="front-matter introduction" id="front-matter-introduction" title="About the Book"><div class="front-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="front-matter-number">1</h3><h1 class="front-matter-title">About the Book</h1></div><div class="ugc front-matter-ugc"> <p><em>BC Reads: Adult Literacy Fundamental English – Course Pack 6</em>&nbsp; was created by Shantel Ivits.&nbsp;This creation is a part of the&nbsp;<a href="http://open.bccampus.ca/" data-url="http://open.bccampus.ca/">B.C. Open Textbook project</a>.</p> <p>The B.C. Open Textbook project began in 2012 with the goal of making post-secondary education in British Columbia more accessible by reducing student cost through the use of openly licensed textbooks. The B.C. Open Textbook project is administered by BCcampus and funded by the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education.</p> <p>Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in ways so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials. OER are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others (<a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources" data-url="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources">Hewlett Foundation</a>).</p> <p>Our open textbooks are openly licensed using a&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons&nbsp;license</a>, and&nbsp;are offered in various e-book formats free of charge, or as printed books that are available at cost.</p> <p>For more information about this project, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:opentext@bccampus.ca" data-url="mailto:opentext@bccampus.ca">opentext@bccampus.ca</a>.</p> <p>If you are an instructor who is using this book for a course, <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/">please let us know</a>.</p> </div></div>
<div class="front-matter acknowledgements post-introduction" id="front-matter-acknowledgements" title="Acknowledgments"><div class="front-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="front-matter-number">2</h3><h1 class="front-matter-title">Acknowledgments</h1></div><div class="ugc front-matter-ugc"> <p>These books were developed on the unceded territories of the Musqueam, Squamish, and Tsleil-Waututh Nations.&nbsp;Huy tseep q’u!&nbsp;Chen kw’enmántumiyap!&nbsp;Kw’as hoy!</p> <p>I feel very fortunate to have had the opportunity to work on this project alongside a dedicated team of basic education instructors from across British Columbia. This series was shepherded by Leanne Caillier-Smith (College of the Rockies) and benefited enormously from the insight and encouragement of Julia Dodge (University of the Fraser Valley), Chandra McCann (Okanagan College), Jan Weiten (Vancouver Community College), and Melinda Worfolk (College of New Caledonia). The above five mentioned are representatives of the BC Adult Literacy Articulation Committee and were the advisory committee members for this project. It has been a pleasure to scaffold my own learning among such brilliant and passionate educators.</p> <p>Huge thanks to Lauri Aesoph of BCcampus for introducing me to the exciting open textbook movement and managing all aspects of the publication of these books &nbsp;— from layout and image selection to copyediting and print –so adeptly.</p> <p>I am incredibly lucky to work with and have the support of the Basic Education Department at Vancouver Community College: Rita Acton, Cynthia Bluman, Andrew Candela, Lynn Horvat, Alayna Kruger, Jo Lemay, Edie Mackenzie, Rene Merkel, Tara Mollel, Leah Rasmussen, Linda Rider, Mary Thompson-Boyd, Jan Weiten, our Program Assistant, Nadia Kawas, and our Dean, David Wells. I am also deeply grateful to the basic education students at Vancouver Community College for all that you teach me about dreams, resilience, and perseverance.</p> <p>A special thank you to my partner, Marria, for always lending my words an eager ear, and for keeping the world around me turning even though my head was perpetually stuck in these books.</p> </div></div>
<div class="front-matter introduction post-introduction" id="front-matter-notes-to-the-instructor" title="Notes to the Instructor"><div class="front-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="front-matter-number">3</h3><h1 class="front-matter-title">Notes to the Instructor</h1></div><div class="ugc front-matter-ugc"> <p>In the days before YouTube, I created my first digital story without knowing that the genre had a name and was part of a growing movement of do-it-yourself media. Digital storytelling has since become a popular tool in literacy teaching and learning. I experienced this firsthand as part of the Literacy Lives teaching team at Simon Fraser University. At the end of the program, learners were assigned the task of creating a digital story to share their learning in the program. The results were tear-jerkingly&nbsp;powerful.</p> <p>More recently, I had the opportunity to be a storytelling mentor in a project called&nbsp;Cancer’s Margins. For this project, people&nbsp;made digital stories sharing&nbsp;what it was like to live&nbsp;in the intersection of queerness and cancer. As a result of the deeply moving and transformative experiences I’ve had with&nbsp;these projects, I am excited to share a digital storytelling curriculum specifically tailored to basic education students. It is based on the excellent work of the Center for Digital Storytelling in Berkeley, California.</p> <p>This course pack embeds fundamental English and computer literacy learning in a project-based curriculum that has a whole lot of soul. It is designed to meet the learning outcomes for Adult Literacy Fundamental English Level 6, as outlined in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.aved.gov.bc.ca/abe/docs/handbook.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="http://www.aved.gov.bc.ca/abe/docs/handbook.pdf">ABE in BC 2014/2015 Articulation Handbook</a>. This is roughly equivalent to grades 7.5 to 9 in the K-12 system.</p> <p>This course pack is designed to be used with <em><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/">BC Reads Adult Literacy Fundamental English – Reader 6</a></em>. The reader includes 11 level-appropriate texts that describe, step-by-step, how to create a digital story. Each text contains between 500 and 1,000 words. Convenient links to these readings are found throughout this course pack.</p> <p>Each chapter of the course pack contains:</p> <ul><li>Pre-reading questions that can be used for individual reflection, journaling, or class discussion.</li> <li>Vocabulary-building exercises</li> <li>Word attack strategies</li> <li>Comprehension questions</li> <li>Grammar lessons and practice exercises</li> <li>Writing tasks</li> </ul> <p>For detailed information, please refer to the Level 6 Scope and Sequence document, also available in printable form in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix-4-level-6-scope-and-sequence/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix-4-level-6-scope-and-sequence/">Appendix 4</a>.</p> <p>To help students develop their computer literacy skills, the online version of this book contains videos that allow learners&nbsp;to watch a skill being performed. These&nbsp;videos are followed by step-by-step written instructions to further support&nbsp;learners&nbsp;as they&nbsp;try out&nbsp;each new&nbsp;skill.</p> <p>Creating a digital story is a deeply personal process. For this reason, I do not encourage instructors to assess learning based on the end product of the digital story. Evaluation&nbsp;of the digital story may add pressure and anxiety that can detract from the learning process. The process is more important than the product. A variety of assignments and assessment tools are suggested throughout the course pack that will allow instructors and learners to measure learning in more effective and ethical ways. For example, in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix/">Appendix 3</a>, you will find a checklist to score the writing tasks assigned at the end of each chapter.</p> <p>It is also crucial that learners have the final say&nbsp;about how their digital story will be shared. For ethical guidelines, please see the Center for Digital Storytelling’s&nbsp;<a href="http://storycenter.org/ethical-practice/" target="_blank" data-url="http://storycenter.org/ethical-practice/">Digital Storyteller’s Bill of Rights</a>.</p> <p>This course pack includes&nbsp;a number of graphic organizers to help students organize their thoughts in a visual way. In <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/">Appendix 1</a>, you can access and print a complete set of these&nbsp;graphic organizers. Students can also download and print them as needed, through the links embedded throughout the course pack. <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/digital-story-progress-sheet/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/digital-story-progress-sheet/">Appendix 2</a> contains a Digital Story Progress Sheet and <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/appendix/">Appendix 3</a> has a Paragraph Writing Checklist; each of these pages contains both a link and print-friendly version.</p> <p>You may wish to use this program online, or you may wish to print it for your students by downloading it as a PDF. This program was designed to suit both options. An Internet connection is needed to watch the digital stories that are highlighted throughout the curriculum, as well as to access the web-based tool that allows learners to build their own digital stories.</p> <p>Font size and line spacing can be adjusted in the online view, and have been enhanced for the print and PDF versions for easier reading. (In addition, both epub and mobi files are offered for students with e-readers and Kindles.)</p> <p>This course pack has been reviewed by subject experts from colleges and universities.</p> <p>I hope these pages help learners find new meaning in their everyday relationships and experiences, as well as equip them with new tools to share their voice and perspectives with the world.</p> <p>-Shantel Ivits</p> </div></div>

Do you think this is accurate, based on stories you’ve seen in movies, books, TV shows, and video games? Can you think of other groups that don’t have enough stories told from their point of view?</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-282" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-1024x576.jpg" alt="http://pixabay.com/en/network-computer-laptop-connection-698598/" class="wp-image-282" height="253" width="450" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-300x169.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-65x37.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-225x127.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280-350x197.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/network-698598_1280.jpg 1280w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-282">Digital stories</div></div> <p style="padding-left: 30px">5.

In this book, you will learn how to write paragraphs that describe things, explain how to do things, tell a story, or give an opinion. No matter what kind of writing task you are working on, there is a strategy you can use to stay on track. It’s called TOWER. The letters in TOWER stand for Think, Organize, Write, Edit, and Rewrite.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3 itemprop="educationalUse">Writing Task</h3> <p>“Thomas King is the best storyteller in the world.”</p> <p>“Movies and television shows do not&nbsp;have enough main characters with disabilities.”</p> <p>“Canada needs more Canadian television shows.”</p> <p>Each of the above statements is an opinion. Unlike a fact, an opinion is something that people may&nbsp;agree or disagree about. An <strong>opinion paragraph</strong> is a group of sentences that state an opinion and explain your position. The author may want to&nbsp;convince the&nbsp;reader to agree with him or her. To be convincing,&nbsp;the&nbsp;paragraph will usually give at least three reasons, facts, or examples that support the belief.</p> <p>Follow the steps below to write an opinion paragraph on this topic.</p> <p>Imagine a world with no Internet. In your opinion, would the world be a better place or a worse place? Give reasons for your opinion.</p> <p><strong>1. Think:</strong> Try free-writing about this topic for five minutes. Free-writing is an activity where you write everything that comes to your mind. Don’t stop writing, even for a second. Don’t worry about grammar or whether your ideas are any good. The point of free-writing is to come up with&nbsp;as many ideas as possible. When five minutes are up, look back at the ideas you came up with. It’s time to make some decisions. What will your opinion be? Do you think the world would be a better place without the Internet? Are there any details you want to&nbsp;use from your free-writing&nbsp;to support your opinion? Can you think of any additional ideas to support your opinion?</p> <p><strong>2. Organize:</strong> Ask your instructor for the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf">Paragraph Outline</a> worksheet, or open and print one from the link. You will also find a printable version in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/">Appendix 1</a>. Fill in&nbsp;the outline with your best ideas.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong> Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your opinion paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a&nbsp;thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>point of view</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>virus</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>online</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>ordinary</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>professional</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>invention</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>role</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>combine</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>recite</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>honour</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>inventor</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>viral</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>combination</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>extraordinary</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>These inventions made it possible to share stories with a large audience around the world.

One strategy is to stop after each paragraph and try to retell the main idea in your own words.</p> <p>Try this strategy as you read <em><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/chapter/whats-your-story/" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/chapter/whats-your-story/">What’s Your Story?</a></em></p> <h1><span style="color: #003366">Check Your Understanding</span></h1> <p>1. A good way to check your understanding of a text is to summarize it. A <strong>summary</strong> is an explanation of the main ideas of a text. A summary&nbsp;does not include details or examples. It does not include your opinion of the text. Write a summary of&nbsp;the six types of stories described in this chapter.</p> <p>2. An <strong>inference</strong> is an educated guess about what a text is saying, using your knowledge and logic. <em><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/chapter/whats-your-story/" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader6/chapter/whats-your-story/">What’s Your Story</a></em>&nbsp;suggests that students should avoid exploring personal stories with lots of difficult emotions when at school. Make an inference about why this might be a good idea.</p> <p>3. As we read, we form our own thoughts about the text. We form judgments, or opinions. This is often called <strong>drawing conclusions</strong>. Draw a conclusion about&nbsp;which category <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB58Z85J70Q" target="_blank" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB58Z85J70Q">7th Word</a></em> fits into best.

Try this:</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">1. In the text, locate&nbsp;the five activities Joe Lambert recommends for finding a story to tell.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">2. Choose&nbsp;one of these activities and try it.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">3. Play with your story ideas until you find the seed of a story you want to tell.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">4. Write down the basics of your story idea, so that you don’t forget them&nbsp;later.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">5.

Think:</strong>&nbsp;Brainstorm a big list of places that have played a role in your life. For example, the place could be a home, a town, a gathering place, a mountain, or a forest. Then, choose one place from your list and&nbsp;fill out the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/07/Mind-Map3.pdf" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/07/Mind-Map3.pdf">Mind Map</a>.

Organize:</strong>&nbsp;Choose the&nbsp;best ideas from your Mind Map. Put a number next to each idea, to show what you will write about first, second, third, and so on.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your descriptive&nbsp;paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>category</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>participant</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>influenced</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>generated</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>therapeutic</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>overwhelming</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>dramatic</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>achieving</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>identifies</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>valuable</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>participation</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>categorize</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>identification</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>dramatize</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td><em>What’s Your Story</em> describes six story types.

Think:</strong>&nbsp;Brainstorm a list of stories you heard as a child. Think of ones that are meant to teach&nbsp;a lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, choose the one story you want to tell.</p> <p><strong>2. Organize:</strong>&nbsp;Ask your instructor for the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/07/Tell-a-Story2.pdf" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/07/Tell-a-Story2.pdf">Tell a Story</a> worksheet, or open and print one from the link. You will also find a printable version in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/">Appendix 1</a>. Fill in&nbsp;the outline with the story events. Put them in the correct order.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your narrative&nbsp;paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>accident</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>insight</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>active</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>medicine</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>audience</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>reflect</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>meaningful</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>embracing</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>diagnosed</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>examining</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>insightful</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>examination</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>reflection</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>medical or medicinal</td> </tr> <tr><td>15</td> <td>meaningless</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>The&nbsp;kinds of stories we tend to remember best are the ones that hold an insight into what it means to be human.</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>One purpose of&nbsp;storytelling mentioned in the text is for the storyteller&nbsp;to share an important lesson with the audience.

Then read the words after it. Now think of a word that would make sense for the word you underlined. Does it sound right?

Explain how to be a good listener to your friend.</p> <p><strong>1. Think:</strong>&nbsp;Try free-writing about this topic for five minutes. Free-writing is an activity where you write everything that comes to your mind. Don’t stop writing, even for a second. Don’t worry about grammar or whether your ideas are any good. The point of free-writing is to come up with&nbsp;as many ideas as possible. When five minutes are up, look back at the ideas you came up with.&nbsp;Which ideas do you want to use in your paragraph?</p> <p><strong>2. Organize:</strong>&nbsp;Ask your instructor for the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf">Paragraph Outline</a> worksheet, or open and print one from the link.

Fill in&nbsp;the outline with your best ideas about how to be a good listener. Put them in an order that makes sense.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your how-to&nbsp;paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table style="width: 100%;"><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>overall</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>exaggerated</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>amused</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>confident</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>loneliness</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>fascinated</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>empowered</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>inspired</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>thrilled</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>curious</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>dishonest</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>honest</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>exaggeration</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>confidence</td> </tr> <tr><td>15</td> <td>empowerment</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>Stories reduce the distance between people by tapping into emotion.</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>Tone refers to the overall emotional feel of the story.</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>Answers may vary.

Rent is due on the first day of the month unless you have a different agreement with your landlord.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">4. Pay your rent by cheque or money order if you can.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">5. When you move in check the house with the landlord to make sure the place is clean and everything works.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">6. Once you finish checking the house with the landlord get a copy of the inspection report.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">7. If the landlord asks you to pay a damage deposit the amount cannot be greater than a half-month’s rent.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px;">8.

Write:</strong> Write a first draft of your cover letter.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your cover letter that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand in your cover letter&nbsp;to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>advice</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>obvious</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>deporting</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>powerfully</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>abusive</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>scenes</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>compensation</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>common sense</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>ignored</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>overloaded</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>stunned</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>advisor</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>obviously</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>import</td> </tr> <tr><td>15</td> <td>export</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>“Show, don’t tell” means to allow the audience to understand the story through scenes, rather than through a summary of events.</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>A scene and a summary are different because a scene paints a picture with actions, conversation, and emotion.

Kennedy and his wife, Jackie, arrived in Texas on a sunny day in 1963. They drove away from the airport in a black, open-topped car and waved to the crowds gathered on the streets. Suddenly, three or four gunshots rang out. President Kennedy’s hand went to his neck. He has been shot. At one o’clock that day, the world hears the news that President John F. Kennedy is dead.</p> <p>For no good reason, the paragraph shifts from past tense to present tense with this line: He <strong>has</strong> been shot.

The police searched for the murderer. An officer named J.D. Tippet noticed a man who was behaving strangely. Tippet wanted to speak to the man, but the man will pull out a gun and kill him.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">2. Police find the murderer, Lee Harvey Oswald, in a theatre. Oswald’s gun was found near a window that looked&nbsp;onto the street where Kennedy was shot. Oswald was charged with the two murders and taken to jail.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">3. Two days later, Oswald was being moved to another jail. As he comes out of the police building in handcuffs, another man shot him. That man, Jack Ruby, said he wanted to save Jackie Kennedy from the pain of a long trial.</p> <p style="padding-left: 30px">4. Today, people wonder whether Lee Harvey Oswald really killed John F. Kennedy. More than 50 people who were there that day will say&nbsp;that they heard gunshots coming from a small grassy hill in front of the president’s car.

Think:</strong>&nbsp;Try free-writing about both the advantages and&nbsp;disadvantages of divorce for five minutes. Free-writing is an activity where you write everything that comes to your mind. Don’t stop writing, even for a second. Don’t worry about grammar or whether your ideas are any good. The point of free-writing is to come up with&nbsp;as many ideas as possible. When five minutes are up, look back at the ideas you came up with. It’s time to make some decisions. What topic would you rather write about? What&nbsp;details can you use from your free-writing? Can you think of any additional ideas to support your opinion?</p> <p><strong>2. Organize:</strong>&nbsp;Ask your instructor for the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf">Paragraph Outline</a> worksheet, or open and print one from the link. You will also find a printable version in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/">Appendix 1</a>. Fill in&nbsp;the outline with your best ideas.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your opinion paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>template</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>access</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>downloaded</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>documents</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>available</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>audio elements</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>visual elements</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>facilitator</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>permission</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>accessible</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>facilitate</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>audible</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>availability</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><b>Check Your Understanding</b></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>Examples of visual elements found in digital stories include photos, drawing, maps, videos, letters, pages from a book, album covers, and clothing.</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>Examples of audio elements found in digital stories include a voiceover and a soundtrack.</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>Copyright is a law that says the owner of a creative work gets to decide how their work is used.</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>A storyboard is a place to plan what an audience will see and hear during each part of a visual story.</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>At first, Daniel thought the photos from the Grand Canyon trip were funny.

Think:</strong>&nbsp;Try free-writing&nbsp;for five minutes about the advantages of learning to make a digital story. Free-writing is an activity where you write everything that comes to your mind. Don’t stop writing, even for a second. Don’t worry about grammar or whether your ideas are any good. The point of free-writing is to come up with&nbsp;as many ideas as possible. When five minutes are up, look back at the ideas you came up with.</p> <p><strong>2. Organize:</strong>&nbsp;Ask your instructor for the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf" target="_blank" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/wp-content/uploads/sites/87/2015/06/Paragraph-Outline1.pdf">Paragraph Outline</a> worksheet, or open and print one from the link. You will find a printable version in <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf6/back-matter/graphic-organizers/">Appendix 1</a>. Fill in&nbsp;the outline with your best ideas.</p> <p><strong>3. Write:</strong>&nbsp;Follow&nbsp;your outline as you write&nbsp;a first draft of your paragraph.&nbsp;Don’t worry too much about spelling and grammar. Just get your ideas down in a way that makes sense. At this point, you may want to put your draft aside so you can look at it with fresh eyes later.</p> <p><strong>4. Edit:</strong>&nbsp;Use a different colour to make edits to your writing. Check to see how it sounds when you read it out loud. Is the meaning clear? Are there any details that are missing or off topic? Should you use different sentence types to make it flow more smoothly? Are there any words that you want to change to make your writing more alive? (Use a thesaurus to find more interesting vocabulary words.) Are all your sentences complete? Do you need to check the spelling of any words in a dictionary?</p> <p><strong>5. Rewrite</strong>:&nbsp;Write a final copy of your paragraph that includes all your edits. You may wish to type it on a computer. Finally, hand it in to your instructor.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><h2>Answer Key</h2> <table><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Vocabulary</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>public</td> </tr> <tr><td>2</td> <td>version</td> </tr> <tr><td>3</td> <td>process</td> </tr> <tr><td>4</td> <td>rewarding</td> </tr> <tr><td>5</td> <td>final</td> </tr> <tr><td>6</td> <td>product</td> </tr> <tr><td>7</td> <td>creation</td> </tr> <tr><td>8</td> <td>web address</td> </tr> <tr><td>9</td> <td>convert</td> </tr> <tr><td>10</td> <td>plate-ful</td> </tr> <tr><td>11</td> <td>non-sense</td> </tr> <tr><td>12</td> <td>un-like-ly</td> </tr> <tr><td>13</td> <td>anti-freeze</td> </tr> <tr><td>14</td> <td>ship-ment</td> </tr> <tr><td>15</td> <td>kind-ness</td> </tr> <tr><td>16</td> <td>hope-less</td> </tr> <tr><td>17</td> <td>a-ble</td> </tr> <tr><td>18</td> <td>sim-ple</td> </tr> <tr><td>19</td> <td>strug-gle</td> </tr> <tr><td>20</td> <td>ta-ble</td> </tr> <tr><td>21</td> <td>pock-et</td> </tr> <tr><td>22</td> <td>can-dle</td> </tr> <tr><td>23</td> <td>raf-fle</td> </tr> <tr><td>24</td> <td>bath-tub</td> </tr> <tr><td>25</td> <td>wish-ful</td> </tr> <tr><td colspan="2"><strong>Check Your Understanding&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td><strong>QUESTION</strong></td> <td><strong>ANSWER</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>1</td> <td>Answers may vary. <em>The 8th Step</em> is a digital story about a man whose dog was taken away from him when he went into treatment for an addiction.
