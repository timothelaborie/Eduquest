It is the stylist’s responsibility to assess the client’s individual&nbsp;physical and personal attributes to suggest a suitable hairstyle and facial hair design.</p> <p>So what makes for a good consultation?</p> <p>Your assessment should include:</p> <ul><li>Face shape</li> <li>Head shape</li> <li>Growth patterns</li> </ul> <h1>Face Shape</h1> <p>During the consultation phase of the barbering service, it is important for the barber/stylist to have the ability to recognize and determine the client’s facial shape. Face shape is an important component of any haircut or facial hair design. This is because the shape of the final look&nbsp;can highlight or detract from certain facial features.&nbsp;Be sure to take the client’s preferences into account, and use tact when suggesting a certain style.</p> <p>The most common face shapes are as follows:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"><caption>Oval</caption> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><img class="wp-image-57 aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/joseph-gonzalez-iFgRcqHznqg-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Man with oval face shape" width="250" height="375" title="" /></td> <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: middle;">&nbsp; <p>The oval face is considered to have the most ideal proportions. This shape has balanced <span class="glossary-term">symmetry</span>, and those with an oval face shape can easily wear most hair styles and beard designs. Keep in mind, however, that an overgrown beard that is either very wide or very long will detract from the oval’s natural symmetry.</p></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"><caption>Round</caption> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: middle;">&nbsp; <p>The round face has a fairly equal length-to-width proportion, with a softer jawline and shorter chin.</p> <p>Haircuts and styles that provide height on the top of the head, width above the temple, or angular shapes will help the lengthen the round face shape.</p> <p>When shaping facial hair on a round face, the goal is to create an illusion of angles or length. Keep the sides closely cropped to avoid adding width, and instead put focus on lengthening the chin area to create a more oval appearance. Add angles by cleaning up and shaping the upper outline of the beard into a straighter line. A goatee is also a great option for the round face, as it creates the illusion of length at the chin.&nbsp;</p></td> <td style="width: 50%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-23" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2.jpg" alt="Man with round face shape" width="250" height="233" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2.jpg 1971w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-300x280.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-1024x955.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-768x717.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-1536x1433.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-65x61.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-225x210.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/aryo-lahap-ZVc4Zg4TY8s-unsplash2-350x327.jpg 350w" title="" /></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"><caption>Square</caption> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 50%;"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-24" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652.jpg" alt="Man with square face shape" width="250" height="282" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652.jpg 2202w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-266x300.jpg 266w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-907x1024.jpg 907w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-768x867.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-1361x1536.jpg 1361w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-1815x2048.jpg 1815w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-65x73.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-225x254.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-mikael-blomkvist-64763652-350x395.jpg 350w" title="" /></td> <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: middle;">&nbsp; <p>Similar to the round face shape, the square&nbsp;shape has a fairly equal length-to-width ratio, but is discernible by its strong angles at the hairline and chin.</p> <p>A more rounded haircut with soft edges towards the temples will help to soften the strong corners of the square face shape.</p> <p>When suggesting a beard style, you’ll want to avoid adding emphasis to the angular jaw.

For example, strong/heavy features require a larger moustache design for a balanced appearance, while fine/slight features require a smaller moustache design. Take into consideration the size of the nose, the upper lip shape, the width of the mouth, and the width of the chin, jaw, and cheeks. As a barber, you have the ability to enhance or detract from the client’s prominent facial features with the chosen style of moustache. Use the same principles as you would with hair styles&nbsp;for facial and beard design.</p> <h1>Head Shape</h1> <p>Prior to performing a haircut or facial hair design, the barber/stylist must also assess the client’s head shape. Head shape will influence what length(s) and techniques will be used to create balance, proportion, and suitability for the client.</p> <p>Generally, heads are comprised of rounded areas (<span class="glossary-term">crown</span>, <span class="glossary-term">parietal</span>, and <span class="glossary-term">occipital</span>), concave curved areas (below the occipital towards the <span class="glossary-term">nape</span>), and flat areas (sides and top of head). Often, when we do a visual assessment of a client’s head shape, we will discover that not everyone fits the general description above. For example, a client that has a flat, and squared off head shape may benefit from a haircut that is more rounded in shape&nbsp;so as to soften the overall appearance. Other physical features such as ridges, a predominant occipital bone, flat or indented areas, or even a scar in the nape area require specific attention. They also provide warnings, telling you to consider all factors&nbsp;before tapering the cut as closely as you were initially thinking.</p> <h2>Predominant Occipital Bone</h2> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-29 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-292x300.jpg" alt="A pronounced occipital bone, which is on the lower back of the skull." width="292" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-292x300.jpg 292w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-768x788.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-65x67.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-225x231.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-350x359.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone.jpg 957w" title="" /></p> <p>A pronounced occipital bone can affect the nape trim, namely in the way in which you will blend the nape area into the rest of the haircut. If there is a ridge in the skull, it is best to leave the areas below and above slightly longer than the hair directly over the ridge so as to detract from it, and to allow for a smoother and straighter transition. If the client wants to disguise the ridge completely, suggest a slightly longer cut and avoid tightly faded styles.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_32" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32" style="width: 595px"><img class="wp-image-30" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison.jpg" alt="Image showing difference in balance of hair around occipital bone" width="595" height="307" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison.jpg 1902w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-300x155.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-1024x529.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-768x397.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-1536x793.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-65x34.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-225x116.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/occipital-bone-comparison-350x181.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-32">Maintain length around the occipital to create a smooth transition (left). Avoid following the ridge with your clipper, as this will highlight the pronounced occipital (right).</div></div> <h2>Flat or Indented Areas</h2> <p>Flat or indented areas can occur anywhere on the head, including the nape. If the head is asymmetrical in shape, it is best to shorten and shape the hair on either side of the flat area first, so that you can use that hair as a guide while working over the indented area, so as to create a smooth transition and the appearance of a symmetry.</p> <h2>Scalp Folds or Scars</h2> <p>Occasionally you will have a client that has scalp folds or scarring in the nape area. If the client wishes to hide these features, opt for a slightly longer hairstyle that allows for enough length in the nape to blend the hair seamlessly over the area.</p> <h1>Additional Considerations</h1> <h2>Growth Patterns in the Nape and Sideburns</h2> <p class="import-Normal">Why are growth patterns important to consider before starting a service?</p> <p class="import-Normal">Growth patterns play a tremendous role in how the hair will respond to being cut. They also inform the barber/stylist&nbsp;as to which techniques will be used to cut the hair. Prior to performing a service, pay careful attention to the direction of the hair growth and any changes in the <span class="glossary-term">grain</span>.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-74" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Growth-Patterns-1024x448-1.png" alt="" width="573" height="251" title="" /></p> <p class="import-Normal">The grain is established by the direction in which the hair grows out of the surface of the skin. The grain changes when hair growing&nbsp;in one direction meets up with hair growing in the opposite or differing direction. Whorls, double crowns, and cowlicks are all visual indicators of growth patterns and the direction of grain.</p> <p>During the pre-service consultation, the stylist/barber must evaluate for growth patterns and direction of grain particularly around the client’s hairline and the nape area. This is especially important when hair is to be cut or removed entirely. When shaping the nape, the general rule is to follow the client’s natural hairline, rather than creating an entirely new shape. This encourages a&nbsp;more natural look as&nbsp;the hair grows back between services. While the stylist/barber&nbsp;is required to make recommendations regarding the client’s hairline, they must also take into consideration the client’s preferences.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-32" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth.jpg" alt="" width="467" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth.jpg 721w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth-300x193.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth-225x144.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Nape-hair-growth-350x225.jpg 350w" title="" /></p> <p>When removing excess nape hair with a razor, it is best to follow the grain of the hair growth to minimize discomfort and ingrown hairs. In some instances, if further removal or closeness is required,&nbsp;a procedure may be used to shave against the grain. You will find further information on this in <a class="internal" href="#part-remove-facial-and-nape-hair" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/part/remove-facial-and-nape-hair/">Chapter 4</a>.</p> <p class="import-Normal">While we see endless combinations of growth patterns on the nape and scalp, we tend to see more predictable growth patterns while performing facial hair design and shaves.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: In Chapter 4, you will learn about the methodical way in which a shave is performed, in terms of areas of the face and razor stroke direction. Because it is important to follow the grain while shaving, the barber/stylist may switch up the direction of the razor stroke if an atypical growth pattern is detected.</div> <h3>Media

Although many skin growths and blemishes are harmless in nature, they require special attention when performing a hair-removal service so as to avoid accidental laceration when using shears, trimmers, clippers, and razors that come into close contact with the skin.</p> <p>In this chapter we will take a closer look at the following:</p> <ul><li>Growths</li> <li>Blemishes</li> <li>Ingrown hairs</li> <li>Scars</li> <li>Skin sensitivity</li> </ul> <h1>Growths</h1> <p>Growths on the skin are caused by an accumulation of skin cells. Typically, growths appear as flat or raised with a varying degree of pigmentation from skin tone to black.</p> <p>Growths are classified as either:</p> <ul><li>Controlled: A benign growth that has <em>not</em> spread to other areas of the body.</li> <li>Uncontrolled: A malignant growth that has spread into neighbouring tissues or other areas of the body.</li> </ul> <p>Controlled growths, such as benign moles or skin tags, are caused by factors such as genetics, viruses (i.e., warts), sun exposure, and diseases that are systemic in the body.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: As a stylist/barber, if you detect any changes in your client’s moles or other growths, advise them to see their practitioner for further examination.</div> <h2>Moles</h2> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/image1.jpg" alt="A dark, slightly raised spot the size of a dime on a persons face." width="220" height="165" title="" /></p> <p>A mole is formed when the <span class="glossary-term">melanocytes</span> produce coloured spots or marks on the skin’s surface. Moles can vary in colour from skin tone to black, and can have either a flat or raised appearance. Over time, moles may change in colour and shape. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor them for abnormalities.</p> <p>When trimming or removing hair around a mole, work carefully. Protect or move the mole out of the way with your finger, if possible, while cutting or shaving so as to avoid an accidental injury.</p> <h2>Skin Tags</h2> <p><img class="aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/image2.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="209" title="" /></p> <p>Skin tags can often be found on the neck. They are flesh-coloured flaps that are small and soft to the touch. Although harmless, care should be taken when removing hair near and around a skin tag. Use the same technique with skin tags as you did with moles.</p> <h1>Blemishes</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_39" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39" style="width: 513px"><img class="wp-image-37" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish.jpg" alt="" width="513" height="226" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish.jpg 1275w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-300x132.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-1024x452.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-768x339.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-65x29.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-225x99.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/blemish-350x155.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-39">From left to right: Whiteheads, blackheads, and pustules/pimples.</div></div> <p>A blemish appears as a spot, discoloration, or imperfection on the surface of the skin. The three most common blemishes that a barber/stylist will see on a client’s face or neck are whiteheads, blackheads, and pustules/pimples.</p> <p>Although blemishes are generally not harmful, clients may be embarrassed or distressed by them. The appearance, development, and reoccurrence of most blemishes can be controlled by a healthy diet, professional skincare, and/or over-the-counter medicated products. If a client is unable to manage their skin, you can advise them to seek the advice of a physician or a dermatologist.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: You should not proceed with a trimming or shaving service on an open and active growth or blemish, as this may promote the spread of bacteria to the surrounding skin.</div> <h1>Ingrown Hairs</h1> <p><strong xml:lang="en-US"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/image4.png" alt="" width="190" height="190" title="" /></strong></p> <p>Ingrown hairs are the result of dead skin cells congesting the hair follicle. This causes the hair to grow sideways or turn back onto itself underneath the skin, rather than growing upward to the skin’s surface as expected. An ingrown hair typically appears as a small raised bump which will likely resolve itself over time. However, if an ingrown hair becomes inflamed or infected, it will bear a cyst-like appearance and may require antibiotic treatment.</p> <p>Ingrown hairs can result from a shave service, if proper care is not taken. This issue will be discussed further in <a class="internal" href="#part-remove-facial-and-nape-hair" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/part/remove-facial-and-nape-hair/">Chapter 4</a>.</p> <h1>Scars</h1> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-39" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/chin-scar.jpg" alt="A person with large scars on their cheeck and chin." width="243" height="221" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/chin-scar.jpg 339w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/chin-scar-300x273.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/chin-scar-65x59.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/chin-scar-225x204.jpg 225w" title="" /></p> <p>Scars are caused when the dermis layer of the skin is damaged. This damage can occur from an injury or from a blemish that did not heal correctly. Not all scars are cause for concern. However, if a scar is raised, the barber/stylist must take care not to apply excess pressure to the razor or trimmer as it passes over the scarred area during the service.</p> <h1>Skin Sensitivities</h1> <p>Due to the vast array of clients that a barber/stylist will see over the course of a week, it is quite likely that they will encounter clients that have skin sensitivities.</p> <p>Signs of skin sensitivities include:</p> <ul><li>Skin that flushes easily or has visible redness</li> <li>Skin that is blotchy or itchy</li> <li>Skin that has acute reactions to touch or temperature</li> <li>Skin that has acute reactions to skin care products</li> </ul> <p>What causes skin sensitivities? Skin sensitivities can be caused by a variety of external or internal factors. Some examples are listed in the chart below:</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"><caption>External and Internal Causes of Skin Sensitivities</caption> <tbody><tr><th scope="col">External Factors</th> <th scope="col">Internal factors</th> </tr> <tr><td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;"><ul><li>Harsh ingredients in skin care products</li> <li>Acne treatments (Accutane, Retin A, etc.)</li> <li>Over-exfoliation</li> <li>Too much caffeine or alcohol</li> <li>A poor diet</li> <li>UV exposure</li> <li>Smoking or vaping</li> </ul> </td> <td style="width: 50%; vertical-align: top;"><ul><li>Stress</li> <li>Hormones</li> <li>Genetics</li> <li>Underlying health conditions</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Considerations for treating sensitive skin during a barbering service:</p> <ul><li>Hot towels are&nbsp;<em>not</em> advised if the skin is chapped, or particularly thin and sensitive.</li> <li>Take care when using astringent products, as they may be too harsh and cause discomfort to sensitive skin.</li> </ul> <h3>Media Attributions</h3> <ul><li><a class="internal" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skin_black_mole_10.JPG" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Skin_black_mole_10.JPG">Black Mole</a> by Делфина is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0">CC BY-SA 4.0 Licence</a>.</li> <li><a class="internal" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NeckAcrochordons.jpg" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:NeckAcrochordons.jpg">Skin Tags</a> by <a class="internal" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jmarchn" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Jmarchn">Jmarchn</a> is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.</li> <li><a class="internal" href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vq87xz7x?wellcomeImagesUrl=/indexplus/image/L0070353.html" data-url="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vq87xz7x?wellcomeImagesUrl=/indexplus/image/L0070353.html">Blemishes</a> by Acne Vulgaris, <a class="internal" href="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vq87xz7x" data-url="https://wellcomecollection.org/works/vq87xz7x">Wellcome Collection</a> is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0">CC BY 4.0 Licence</a>.</li> <li><a class="internal" href="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/File:Eingewachsenes_Haar_2010.jpg" data-url="https://wikivisually.com/wiki/File:Eingewachsenes_Haar_2010.jpg">Ingrown Hair</a> by LBPics is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0 Licence</a>.</li> <li><a class="internal" href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scar_revision.jpg" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Scar_revision.jpg">Scar</a> by <a class="internal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Themeparkphoto" data-url="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Themeparkphoto">Themeparkphoto</a> is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0">CC BY-SA 3.0 Licence</a>.</li> </ul> </div></div>

Let’s explore the tools that are used for facial hair design and hair removal in both the nape and facial areas.</p> <h1 class="import-Normal">Shears</h1> <p>Shears are used for haircuts to remove length and bulk and to create the shape of the design. A shear-over-comb technique is used for the removal of nape hair, facial hair design, and the trimming of eyebrows. In addition, shears can be used to remove hair entirely by placing the blades flat against the skin. However, when extreme closeness is desired, clippers, trimmers, or a razor are preferable to shears because they create a closer result.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_5krw282c" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_5krw282c">Video: Using Shears to Trim the Side of a Beard</a></strong></p> <p>Note: Video has no sound.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_5krw282c/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Using Shears to Trim the Side of a Beard&amp;quot;" title="Using Shears to Trim the Side of a Beard" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

There are many styles of clippers available. Some features to consider when purchasing a clipper are size, weight, performance, and power supply (corded or cordless).</p> <p>Many clippers come with a standard set of blades attached and rely on additional guard attachments to determine the length the hair will be cut. Alternatively, some brands of clippers have detachable blades in various sizes that are designed to cut the hair to different lengths without the need for a guard attachment.</p> <p><img class="size-full wp-image-45 aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers.jpg" alt="" width="847" height="367" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers.jpg 847w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers-300x130.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers-768x333.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers-65x28.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers-225x97.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Clippers-350x152.jpg 350w" title="" /></p> <p class="import-Normal" style="text-align: left;">Why use a clipper and not a trimmer? Clippers are useful for working on larger areas or where a large amount of hair needs to be reduced or removed.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: A clipper without a guard may cause discomfort, irritation, or abrasions on the skin if used with excess pressure. Always be cautious and be sure to check-in with the client to ensure their comfort.</div> <h1>Trimmers</h1> <p class="import-Normal" style="text-align: left;">The trimmer is a smaller, more compact version of the clipper. This makes the trimmer ideal for detailing, refining, and outlining a haircut or facial design, and trimming eyebrows. The trimmer is also referred to as an outliner or edger.</p> <p class="import-Normal" style="text-align: left;">Trimmers come in a variety of blade widths and designs (i.e., straight or T-shaped blade). Their use depends on the barber/stylist’s preference, or on specific design techniques used in particular areas of the face and nape.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-225" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-jonathan-nenemann-4952626-2-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="300" title="" /></p> <p class="import-Normal" style="text-align: left;">Trimmers have a much finer cutting blade than that of clippers,&nbsp;so when used with light pressure on the skin they can effectively remove the hair without discomfort. Keep in mind that using too much pressure with a trimmer/outliner&nbsp;runs the same risk of causing abrasions or irritation as the larger clipper.</p> <h1>Guards</h1> <p class="import-Normal">Guards are attachments that are made to fit clippers and trimmers. They enable the hair to be cut to an even, predetermined length. Guards are most often made of hard plastic. However, there are rubber and steel varieties available as well.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-224" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/guards2-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="506" height="300" title="" /></p> <p>Due to the rigidity of the guards, there may be a loss of tension&nbsp;throughout the cutting process. This loss of tension can result in lines, ridges, or uneven results in the final design. To avoid imperfections when using a guarded clipper, use multiple passes from multiple directions to ensure an even and blended outcome.</p> <h1>Combs</h1> <p>While combs are available in various styles or sizes, there are two styles used primarily in facial hair and nape services. The all-purpose cutting comb is useful for scissor-over-comb and clipper-over-comb techniques, when removing length through the beard or nape areas. The tapered cutting comb is ideal for moustache trims and blending in tight areas such as around the ears.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_53" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53" style="width: 267px"><img class="wp-image-205 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/comb-rotated-1.jpg" alt="A comb where all teeth are the same length." width="267" height="71" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-53">All-purpose cutting comb.</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53" style="width: 272px"><img class="wp-image-206 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/comb2-rotated-1.jpg" alt="A comb where the teeth get shorter towards one end." width="272" height="71" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Tapered cutting comb.</div></div> <h1>Straight Razors</h1> <p>Shaving services that demand a close, clean cut require the use of a razor. These services include facial, nape, and neck shaving. The outlining of a haircut can also be achieved using a razor as an alternative to shears.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-238" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-midia-8972622-scaled-1.jpg" alt="" width="1584" height="600" title="" /></p> <p>A razor is the sharpest cutting tool available to the barber/stylist, and is available in two styles:</p> <ul><li>Single-use/changeable blade</li> <li>Conventional blade</li> </ul> <h2>Single-Use Blade Razor</h2> <p>The single-use razor is a lighter-weight option that uses disposable blades. The blades are slid into the head of the razor and can be used with or without a guard. These razors are favorable as they do not require the need to hone or strop the blade, and they are easier to keep clean and sanitary due to their disposable nature.</p> <p>A single-use blade razor is used in two ways:</p> <ol><li>Without a guard to shave the skin</li> <li>With a guard to razor cut the hair</li> </ol> <h2>Conventional Blade Straight Razor</h2> <p>The conventional straight&nbsp;blade razor is a steel implement that has been balanced and tempered for optimal use. These razors must be thoroughly cleaned after each client, and require constant maintenance by honing and stropping the razor to maintain a sharp cutting edge.</p> <p>Honing is the process of sharpening the razor by methodically stroking the blade edge along a hone, which is a block of abrasive material.</p> <p>Stropping is the process of smoothing and shaping the honed razor into a precise cutting implement by methodically passing the blade edge along a durable canvas or leather strap.</p> <p>A good quality conventional straight razor can last a barber/stylist many years if it is consistently sharpened and maintained.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-53" style="width: 259px"><img class="wp-image-382" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/image_67161857-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A strip of leather." width="259" height="194" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Strop</div></div> <h1>Lather Receptacles</h1> <p>The lather receptacle is used to hold and dispense the soap lather during the shave. The most common receptacles typically used in barber shops today are the electric lather receptacle and the lather mug, which is also known as a barber scuttle.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-383" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/image_67164417-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A barber mug/ skuttle with soap and a lather brush inside." width="259" height="247" title="" /></p> <h1>Lather Brush</h1> <p>The lather brush is used to apply soap lather to soften the beard during the shaving process.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-53" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush.jpg" alt="A small, round brush with short bristles." width="259" height="237" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush.jpg 2420w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-300x275.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-1024x939.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-768x705.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-1536x1409.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-2048x1879.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-65x60.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-225x206.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/shavingbrush-350x321.jpg 350w" title="" /></p> <h1>Towel Warmer</h1> <p>The towel warmer is an efficient way to simultaneously store and heat the damp towels needed for the shaving service.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-products" title="2.2 Products"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">4</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">2.2 Products</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>When performing a beard reshaping or a straight razor shave, there is an extensive range of products on the market that can be used to enhance the service. However, selecting the correct product can be challenging, especially with so many brands available, as each have differing claims as to the benefits and features of their products.</p> <p>This chapter will serve as a guide to break down the basic functions of such products, making it simpler&nbsp;for you to choose the ideal product, regardless of brand.</p> <p>Products covered in this section are:</p> <ul><li>Pre-shave products</li> <li>Shaving products</li> <li>Post-shave products</li> <li>Grooming products</li> </ul> <h1>Pre-Shave Products</h1> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-57" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228.png" alt="A client lies with their head back while the barber applies pre-shave oil to their facial hair." width="534" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228.png 1334w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-300x169.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-1024x576.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-768x432.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-65x37.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-225x126.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/IMG_0228-350x197.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>Pre-shave products typically come in an oil or gel form. These products are not used by every barber/stylist, or on every client, but may be used for a few primary reasons:</p> <ol><li>To soften very coarse facial hair to prevent hair pull and subsequent irritation</li> <li>To lubricate the skin for a smoother glide of the razor</li> <li>To create a thin barrier to protect the skin against the blade of the razor</li> </ol> <p>When choosing between an oil or a gel, keep in mind that a client with oily skin will likely benefit from a gel-based product over an oil-based one. Using a gel-based product will prevent excess oil and reduce the chance of creating blocked pores. Alternatively, a client with dry skin will benefit from an oil-based product, because it provides additional moisture and slickness prior to the shave.</p> <p>The pre-shave product is applied onto clean skin, prior to the shaving lather. In some cases, these oil- or gel-based lubricators can be used as the primary shaving product, as outlined below.</p> <h1>Shaving Products</h1> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-58" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223.png" alt="A client lies with their head back while the barber uses a lather brush to apply shave soap." width="534" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223.png 1334w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-300x169.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-1024x576.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-768x432.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-65x37.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-225x126.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0223-350x197.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>The purpose of a shaving product is to create a thin layer of protection and lubrication, which reduces risk of redness, irritation, <span class="glossary-term">ingrown hairs</span> and potential cuts.</p> <p>Shaving products come in many forms, namely gel, oil, cream, and soap. Some factors to consider when choosing which type to use are: skin type, skin sensitivities, and scent.</p> <h2>Gels</h2> <p>Gels have excellent lubricating properties and are a great choice for oily skin with sensitivities.</p> <h2>Oils</h2> <p>Oils are a great choice for dry, sensitive skin. They are more lubricating than a cream or soap lather. As stated, these are not ideal for clients with oily or acne-prone skin.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: A gel or oil shave product is also a great option when outlining with a razor, as it allows the barber/stylist to clearly visualize the hair that needs to be removed outside of the desired outline, whereas a lather product may conceal it.</div> <h2>Creams and Soaps</h2> <p>Shave creams generally come in a tube or pot. They create a thick, rich lather when mixed with a small amount of water and emulsified (mixed) with a lather brush using a mug/scuttle.</p> <p>Shave soaps typically come in a solid puck form. The barber/stylist works the soap into a rich lather by wetting a shave brush, brushing it over the soap bar, then applying&nbsp;to the face using a circular motion so as&nbsp;to encourage the lather to form. Shave soaps typically have a thinner lather in comparison to a cream.</p> <p>The primary advantage of using using a cream or soap product in addition to, or instead of, a gel or oil product is all due to the application. When cream or soap is applied to the skin using the lather brush and a circular motion, the facial hair is lifted into a more upright position, and it becomes fully saturated with product on all sides. This allows for a closer and smoother shave.</p> <h1>Post-Shave Products</h1> <p>There are numerous post-shave products on the market today. The most commonly used are after-shave tonics, gels, and creams.</p> <p>After-shave is an <span class="glossary-term">astringent</span> product used&nbsp;for three reasons:</p> <ol><li>To calm irritation</li> <li>To disinfect any small nicks in the skin</li> <li>To close the pores to prevent bacteria.</li> </ol> <p>The most common forms of aftershave products are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Alcohol-based</strong>: Excellent astringent and <span class="glossary-term">anti-bacterial</span> properties, but most likely to dry out the skin.</li> <li><strong>Witch hazel:</strong> Contains tannins, a natural compound with gentle astringent properties ideal for sensitive skin.</li> <li><strong>Tea-tree:</strong> Contains naturally occurring <span class="glossary-term">anti-inflammatory</span> and <span class="glossary-term">antiseptic</span> properties. Also a great choice for sensitive skin.</li> </ul> <p>Gel and cream-based post-shave products are beneficial for replenishing moisture to the freshy shaved skin.

Use the first ⅓ of the blade surface to cut the hair. Work on a small panel of hair at a time, using the previous panel as your guideline. Maintaining slow movement of the comb ensures that the segments of hair being cut remain small and manageable.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Cutting nape and/or beard hair while the client is seated upright requires the barber/stylist to maintain an upright posture while leaning slightly away from their scissor/shear hand. The elbow of the barber/stylist should be tilted slightly upright, with the shears extended in front of the stylist. This position enables the barber/stylist to open and close the shears rhythmically with the thumb.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: This technique is more precise when performed on dry hair, as wet hair is more likely to bend away from the comb.</div> <p>In the video below, you will see the shear-over-comb technique being used to trim the sideburn area. In smaller sections, such as the sideburns or eyebrows, the comb remains stationary and is used to simply project the hair away from the face so that the excess hair can be cut using shears.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_00kza11n" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_00kza11n">Video: Sheer-Over-Comb Method</a></strong></p> <p>Note: This video has no sound.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_00kza11n/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Shear-Over-Comb Method&amp;quot;" title="Shear-Over-Comb Method" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is because the guard attachment ensures all hair is cut consistently to the same length throughout, making it an ideal first step when eliminating unwanted hair quickly. To guarantee&nbsp;an all-over even result, the clipper must be carefully guided across the skin as it is moved around the curves and contours of the face.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: When using a guarded clipper to remove length, work against the grain while continuously using a comb to push the hair back into natural fall. This will prevent missed hairs.</div> <p>Because the clipper/trimmer with guard attachment method produces a <span class="glossary-term">uniform</span> length throughout, it is recommended that you complete the service by using one of the over-comb techniques so as to customize the nape and facial hair design.</p> <h2>Free-Hand Shaping</h2> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-386" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-cottonbro-3998426-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A barber trimming a client's bear with just sheers." width="242" height="363" title="" /></p> <p>Free-hand shaping, with clippers, trimmers, or shears, is used to trim away strays and fly-aways, and to refine the overall shape.

While the primary purpose of detailing is to outline and refine the haircut, including facial and nape hair, remember to also pay attention to the eyebrows and ear hair.</p> <p>Shears, trimmers, and razors can all be used at various stages of the outlining service. In this chapter we will focus on the use of shears and trimmers. More detail on the straight razor technique can be found in <a class="internal" href="#part-remove-facial-and-nape-hair" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/part/remove-facial-and-nape-hair/">Chapter 4</a>.</p> <h1>Outlining</h1> <p>Prior to the outlining service, carefully check the nape area, sides of neck, and behind the ears for skin abnormalities such as blemishes, moles, and other growths of the skin. Providing there is no communicable skin diseases, open wounds, and/or skin irritation, it is safe to perform the outlining service. Once you determine that the service is safe to perform,&nbsp;remember to use caution when working around moles and any other raised lesions of the skin.</p> <h2>Outlining with Shears</h2> <p>To detail the finished design with shears, comb the hair past the desired outline, then use the shears to remove any hair which falls outside of the desired outline.

In addition to the trimmers, a cutting or barbering comb can be used to aid with the creation of&nbsp;straight lines and/or angles in the outline. Alternatively, curved lines, such as around the ears, are generally performed with a free-hand technique. Once an outline is established, the clipper/trimmer-over-comb technique is often used to blend the newly established outline into the beard or haircut.</p> <p>Follow these guidelines when detailing with trimmers for a safe and comfortable experience for the client:</p> <ul><li>To establish the initial outline of your design, turn the trimmer so that the teeth are positioned towards the skin. Gently cut along the desired outline to create the guideline.</li> </ul> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-72" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244.png" alt="A trimmer is positioned so the teeth point towards the skin to outline the sideburns." width="137" height="250" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244.png 612w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244-164x300.png 164w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244-560x1024.png 560w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244-65x119.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244-225x411.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/IMG_0244-350x640.png 350w" title="" /></p> <ul><li>Once the guideline is established, turn the trimmer over so that the stationary blade is resting on the skin.

Cleaning these areas up for the client will leave them with a much more polished final look.</p> <p>The three most common methods to trim the eyebrows are:</p> <ul><li>Trimmer-over-comb</li> <li>Shear-over-comb</li> <li>Free-hand trimming with shears</li> </ul> <p>Consult with the client to determine whether you will need to eliminate length, density, or both.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-76" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming.jpg" alt="" width="707" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming.jpg 855w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming-300x127.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming-768x326.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming-65x28.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming-225x96.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Eyebrow-trimming-350x149.jpg 350w" title="" /></p> <p>To perform an eyebrow shaping service:</p> <ul><li>Project the eyebrow hair with a comb, and trim the excess length with a trimmer or shears.</li> <li>Shape the upper brow line by combing the brow hair upwards, then using shears to trim the excess hair just above the brow and create the desired shape.</li> </ul> <p>Practice extreme caution&nbsp;when trimming eyebrows by using a&nbsp;slow, steady hand when working in this area. Always instruct the client to close their eyes during the service to prevent the trimmed hairs from falling into their eyes.</p> <h2>Ears</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">The trimmer/outliner is used to gently remove stray&nbsp;and unwanted hair from the top, sides, and lobes of the ears. The hair on the inner ear should be removed using a delicate touch so no harm is caused to the inner ear. The use of a t-bladed trimmer is preferable when working in confined spaces.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-77" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear.jpg" alt="" width="362" height="250" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear.jpg 661w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear-300x207.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear-225x156.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Trim-around-ear-350x242.jpg 350w" title="" /></p> <h3>Media Attributions</h3> <ul><li><a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-shaving-a-man-s-face-with-straight-razor-897251/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/photo/person-shaving-a-man-s-face-with-straight-razor-897251/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Title image</a> by <a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/@multimediayreaccion?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/@multimediayreaccion?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Mídia</a> is licensed under a&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/license/" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/license/">Pexels Licence</a>.</li> <li><a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-barber-grooming-a-man-s-beard-3998515/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/photo/a-barber-grooming-a-man-s-beard-3998515/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Outlining with shears video</a> by <a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/@cottonbro?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">cottonbro</a> is licensed under a&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="https://www.pexels.com/license/" data-url="https://www.pexels.com/license/">Pexels Licence</a>.</li> <li>Working around ears by A.

Today, however, the popularity of facial hair is more about allowing people to express their personality and sense of style.</p> <p>Besides making a fashion statement, facial hair can be used to accentuate or camouflage facial features and to create a balance of proportions. When shaping a client’s beard or moustache, hair density and growth patterns must be taken into account before the design is executed.</p> <p>The techniques commonly used during facial design services are:</p> <ul><li>Shear-over-comb</li> <li>Clipper-over-comb</li> <li>Clipper/trimmer with a guard attachment</li> <li>Free-hand shaping with shears or clippers</li> <li>Outlining with trimmers</li> <li>Outlining or shaving with a razor</li> </ul> <div class="textbox">Note:&nbsp;Beard and/or moustache trims, cuts, and shapings must be performed prior to a shaving procedure. The shave procedure will be discussed in more detail in <a class="internal" href="#chapter-the-straight-razor-shave" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/chapter/the-straight-razor-shave/">Chapter 4.2</a>.</div> <p>In this chapter, we focus on techniques and procedures for <em>shaping</em>&nbsp;beards and moustaches. Although such techniques and&nbsp;procedures tend vary significantly from client to client (due to hair density, length, and desired outcome), it is the responsibility of the barber to determine which approach is appropriate throughout the consultation process.</p> <p>In the following section, we provide a general overview of the techniques and procedures that can be used.</p> <h1>Beard and Moustache Design</h1> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-154" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/pexels-cottonbro-3998414-scaled-1.jpg" alt="image of man in barber chair" width="450" height="300" title="" /></p> <h2>Tools and Equipment</h2> <ul class="twocolumn"><li>Hair/barber chair with headrest and cover</li> <li>Barber paper towels</li> <li>Neck strips</li> <li>Cutting cape</li> <li>Combs</li> <li>Brushes</li> <li>Shears/scissors</li> <li>Trimmer/outliner</li> <li>Clipper</li> <li>Guards</li> <li>Receptacle or container with a cover to store soiled towels</li> <li>Garbage can with a cover</li> <li>Straight razor handle and blades</li> <li>Sharps container for razors that have been used</li> <li>Shaving lather (cream or gel)</li> <li>Lather dispenser</li> <li>Towels (terry cloth)</li> <li>Antiseptic or witch hazel</li> </ul> <div class="textbox">Note: This list covers the tools required for all facial hair design techniques. Your list may vary depending on the techniques you perform.</div> <h2>Beard Design Procedure</h2> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-295" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/pexels-alexandre-saraiva-carniato-5853394-scaled-1.jpg" alt="image of beard trim" width="450" height="300" title="" /></p> <ol><li>Gather the tools and equipment required for the service.</li> <li>Wash your hands well.</li> <li>Seat the client in the chair in an upright position, and drape your client using a neck strip and cutting cape.</li> <li>Perform a consultation to determine the client’s needs and desired beard design. Specifically, pinpoint the shape, density, and length of the final design. Take note of any skin issues or sensitivities. Repeat the client’s specifications and gain approval before commencing with the service.</li> <li>If the procedure to be used requires the client to be reclined, gently lean the client’s head back onto the headrest to support their neck while they remain in this position. The barber chair can be reclined partially or completely, depending on your requirements for accessing the areas under the chin.<ins></ins></li> <li>Reduce excess hair using the methods outlined in <a class="internal" href="#chapter-outlining-techniques" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/chapter/outlining-techniques/">Chapter 3.2</a>: <ul><li>Clipper/trimmer-over-comb</li> <li>Shear-over-comb</li> <li>Clipper/trimmer with guard</li> <li>Free-hand with clipper, trimmer, or shears <div class="textbox">Note: Using just one, or a combination, of these length removal techniques is dependent on the barber’s preference and what is needed to achieve the desired result. Be sure to leave enough length/<span class="glossary-term">density</span> in this hair reduction step to allow the design to be blended into the desired outcome.</div> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Step back to visually check for <span class="glossary-term">symmetry</span> in density and overall length.</li> <li>Create the lower outline of the beard (under the chin, along or below the jawline) with a trimmer or shears according to the predetermined beard design. To ensure symmetry, start in the centre of the chin and work your way to the left, then right. For added comfort for the client, a towel can be placed underneath the area where the outline is to be created in order to prevent hair clippings from falling on the client’s neck.</li> <li>Create the upper outline of the beard by working from the mouth, upwards along the cheek.</li> <li>Blend the outline into the sideburn area using an over-comb technique.</li> <li>Taper and blend the beard by using clipper-over-comb or shear-over-comb to connect the outline to the overall length/density of the beard.</li> <li>Apply a hot towel. The steam will relax the skin, soften the cuticle layer of the hair, and stimulate the sebaceous glands. Prepare shave product and razor.</li> <li>Remove towel and apply the shave product to the area that is to be shaved with the razor.</li> <li>Shave the underside of the beard from the outline, down. On the cheeks, shave down to the outline.</li> <li>Remove excess shave product and hair. <div class="textbox">Note: Steps 12 to 15 are optional and are described in greater detail in <a class="internal" href="#part-remove-facial-and-nape-hair" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/part/remove-facial-and-nape-hair/">Chapter 4</a>.</div> </li> <li>Place the client back in the upright sitting position, then step back to assess the outline, overall shape, and balance of the beard proportions. Make further adjustments to the beard design if required.</li> <li>Trim and blend the moustache into the beard (see Moustache Design Procedure, in the next section of this chapter,&nbsp;for further detail).</li> <li>Trim and shape the eyebrows and ear hair if needed.</li> <li>Check that all lather and stray hairs have been removed and, if a razor was used, apply an antiseptic or witch hazel to the freshly shaved areas.</li> <li>Check the final overall design, and verify it is to the client’s satisfaction.</li> <li>Apply a grooming product if desired. Recommend any at-home care products that are appropriate for the client’s beard texture and desired look.</li> <li>Remove drapings (cape, neck strip, towels).</li> </ol> <p>Please consider that every beard trim will be different and will be dependent on many aspects of the client in the chair.

It is a sharp tool that should be used with caution, as it requires skill and a steady hand.</p> <p>Before we get started with the straight razor shave service, let’s first review the following topics:</p> <ul><li>The pre-shave consultation</li> <li>Razor handling</li> <li>Razor strokes and corresponding shaving areas</li> <li>Types of shaves</li> <li>How to hone and strop the razor</li> </ul> <h1>The Pre-Shave Consultation</h1> <p>During the pre-shave consultation, the barber/stylist will assess:</p> <ol><li>The skin</li> <li>Growth patterns</li> <li>Medical issues/concerns</li> <li>Skin sensitivities</li> </ol> <p>Keep in mind that face shape and head shape need to be considered if a partial shave is&nbsp;to be performed, such as a beard shave with a moustache shaping.</p> <div class="textbox">Note: Please refer back to <a class="internal" href="#chapter-the-design-consultation" data-url="/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/chapter/the-design-consultation/">Chapter 1.1</a> for a more in-depth explanation about the components of the consultation.</div> <p class="import-Normal">Before assessing&nbsp;the client’s skin and growth patterns, it is a good idea to inquire about&nbsp;their use of&nbsp;facial products and/or medications. Some medications and skin care products, such as Accutane and Retinol, can cause the skin to be more sensitive and easily irritated by the shave process. This is also the time to find out if the client has had other sensitivities in the past, such as a reaction to shaving products, an&nbsp;acne breakout after shaving, or whether they have an aversion to the application of hot or cold towels.</p> <p class="import-Normal">Now it’s time to assess the skin prior to the straight shave service. Carefully check the area that is to be shaved for blemishes, moles, or any lesions of the skin. Additionally, if you plan to perform an outline and nape shave, be sure to check the nape area, sides of neck, and behind the ears. Provided there is no communicable skin diseases, open wounds, or skin irritation, it is safe to perform the shave service. Always use caution when working around moles and any other raised areas of the skin.</p> <h1>Razor Handling</h1> <h2>Razor Components</h2> <p>Before moving on to the razor handling procedure, take a moment to familiarize yourself with the components that make up the standard straight razor. If you have your own razor, lay it open on the table in front of you and identify its parts using the diagram below:</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-86 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled.png" alt="The components of a straight razor include handle, tang, bivot, shank, heel, blade, edge, point, head, back, and shoulder." width="546" height="320" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled.png 546w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled-300x176.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled-65x38.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled-225x132.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/01/Razor-labelled-350x205.png 350w" title="" /></p> <h2>Razor Handling Procedure</h2> <p>Once you have familiarized yourself with the components of the razor, have a look at the images and instructions below.

Thumb on one side, index finger on the other side.</li> <li>The pivot allows for the blade and handle to separate. At this time, shift the little finger of your dominant hand to place it on the tang while the handle is poised into an upward position.</li> <li>The razor must be held by the shank near the shoulder of the blade with the thumb on one side and the index finger on the other side, with the blade shoulder between them. Place the second and third fingers to rest along with the little finger being used to brace the razor.</li> <li>When you wish to close the razor, simply allow your little finger to release, then bring the handle back up to the blade. Be sure that the handle is not struck by the cutting edge while closing.</li> </ol> <h1>Razor Strokes and Positions</h1> <p>The term razor stroke is used to describe the razor while it is in motion and shaving the skin’s surface.</p> <p>The way in which the barber/stylist holds the razor in their hand to perform a stroke is called the <em>position</em>. The position will determine the angle of the blade and the direction in which the strokes will be performed. The optimal angle for the blade while shaving the skin is 30 degrees, with the point of the razor leading the stroke.</p> <p>It is not recommended to shave against the <span class="glossary-term">grain</span> of the hair growth pattern, therefore the razor should be positioned to shave with the grain.</p> <p>There are four razor positions that barbers use to perform shaving services:</p> <ul><li>Freehand</li> <li>Backhand</li> <li>Reverse freehand</li> <li>Reverse backhand</li> </ul> <div class="textbox">Note: The reverse backhand position is not used to shave the face. Rather, it is used to perform shaving on the sides of the neck.</div> <p>Let’s review each of the four razor strokes in further detail, followed by the areas of the face in which each stroke is utilized.</p> <h2>Freehand Stroke</h2> <ol><li><img class="wp-image-194 alignright" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/free-hand-stroke-300x162-1.png" alt="" width="292" height="300" title="" />Use your dominant hand to hold the razor. Rest the handle between the third and fourth fingers, while resting the little finger on the end of the tang. The thumb should rest firmly on the side of the shank close to the shoulder of the blade.</li> <li>The hand should be turned somewhat outward from the wrist with the elbow at a level that is comfortable.</li> <li>Be sure the fingers of your other hand are clean and dry, so as to allow you to hold or stretch the skin without slipping.</li> </ol> <h2>Backhand Stroke</h2> <ol><li><img class="alignright wp-image-89" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Backhand-stroke.png" alt="" width="292" height="156" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Backhand-stroke.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Backhand-stroke-65x35.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Backhand-stroke-225x120.png 225w" title="" />At the pivot, hold the shank of the razor securely between your thumb and first two fingers while holding the razor in a reasonably straight position.</li> <li>Rest your third and fourth fingers on the backside of the handle.</li> <li>Position the back of your hand away from you while bending the wrist slightly downward. Your elbow should be raised in order for your arm to be able to have the freedom of movement. <div class="textbox">Additional approach: With a slightly bent handle, rest the third finger on the end of the tang, while the fourth finger is bent into the palm. This position is used when the barber/stylist favours performing the backhand stroke with movement of the arm versus the movement of the wrist. If wrist movement is preferable simply do not hold the arm as high.</div> </li> <li>Be sure the fingers of your other hand are clean and dry, so as to allow you to hold or stretch the skin taut without slipping. The skin under the razor should be stretched opposite the direction of the stroke.</li> <li>Strokes are to be lead by the point of the razor as you are performing short, gliding strokes away from you in a forward movement.</li> </ol> <h2>Reverse Freehand</h2> <ol><li><img class="alignright wp-image-90" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Reverse-Freehand-Stroke-1-300x164-1.png" alt="" width="292" height="160" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Reverse-Freehand-Stroke-1-300x164-1.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Reverse-Freehand-Stroke-1-300x164-1-65x36.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/Reverse-Freehand-Stroke-1-300x164-1-225x123.png 225w" title="" />Securely hold the razor in the freehand position.</li> <li>Turn your hand towards you so that the edge of the razor is facing upwards.</li> <li>Be sure the fingers of your opposite hand are clean and dry, so as to allow you to hold or stretch the skin taut without slipping while the razor strokes are performed.</li> <li>Place your fingers below or on the backside of the razor opposite to the edge of the blade, as well as the direction of the stroke.</li> <li>Perform gliding movements towards you while using semi-curved strokes.</li> <li>To perform this movement, use the forearm with little twist to your wrist.</li> </ol> <h2>Reverse Backhand Stroke</h2> <ol><li><img class="size-full wp-image-91 alignright" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/reverse-backhand-stroke-2.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="250" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/reverse-backhand-stroke-2.jpg 214w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/reverse-backhand-stroke-2-65x76.jpg 65w" title="" />Securely hold the razor in the backhand position while turning the wrist so that the palm is positioned upwards.</li> <li>Allow the elbow to fall downwards so it is positioned to the side.</li> <li>Your opposite hand should be positioned comfortably so as to pull the skin taut when the razor strokes pass over the skin.</li> <li>With your hand positioned on top of the razor, you will perform fluid gliding movements.</li> <li>You will perform downward strokes down the sides of the neck.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox">Note: The right handed barber performs this stroke on the left side, from behind the ear and down the side of the neck. Whereas the left handed barber performs it on the right side, from behind the ear,&nbsp;and down the side of the neck.</div> <h1>Shaving Areas</h1> <p>In order to perform a facial shave in a systematic way, the shave zones are divided into fourteen specific areas. It is important to learn the order and direction in which each of these fourteen areas are to be shaved, as well as knowing which razor stroke is to be used in each area.</p> <p>The diagram photo below outlines the fourteen areas of the facial shave and shows which stroke is used in each. A left handed barber will invert the diagram, beginning on the left side.</p> <ol><li><img class="alignright wp-image-92" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/DSC_0021-2.png" alt="A mannequin with the 14 shaving areas labelled.

It is performed&nbsp;using a lather on the beard&nbsp;and by shaving in the direction of the grain. This shave&nbsp;removes all visible hair growth and leaves the skin smooth and without irritation.</li> <li><strong>The second time over:</strong> This shave is performed immediately after the first time over to&nbsp;create a closer shave by removing any remaining hair. The second time over shave is generally performed on dampened skin with no lather, while working <em>with</em> or <em>across</em> the grain.</li> <li><strong>The close shave:</strong> A shave that is typically not practiced, unless the client has a particularly challenging beard or growth pattern, in which the first time over and second time over shaves were not enough to adequately remove all of the hair. This shave is performed <em>against </em>the grain, therefore it is not commonly performed as it&nbsp;is more likely to cause irritation, <span class="glossary-term">ingrown hairs</span>, and the possibility of infection.</li> </ul> <h1>How to Hone and Strop the Razor</h1> <p>Honing and stropping the razor is what maintains its sharp edge. If the razor begins to pull while shaving, and the resulting shave is not smooth, then it is time to hone and strop your blade.</p> <p>Honing is the first step to sharpening the blade and consists of lightly passing the razor, <em>leading with the edge</em>, over a gritted stone. Hones come in various grits&nbsp;ranging from coarse to fine. Generally, a razor will be passed over a larger grit first, then a smaller grit, in order to gradually work down the delicate edge.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-93" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone.png" alt="" width="250" height="242" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone.png 532w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone-300x290.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone-65x63.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone-225x218.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/hone-350x339.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>Stropping is the second and final step to sharpening the blade. To strop the razor, the blade is passed, <em>leading with the back</em>, along a canvas or leather strap. This action refines and smooths the honed blade into a precise cutting implement.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter wp-image-94" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop.png" alt="" width="250" height="242" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop.png 645w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop-300x291.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop-65x63.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop-225x218.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/barberingtechniquesforhairstylists/wp-content/uploads/sites/335/2021/03/strop-350x339.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>In the video below, you will see the honing and stropping procedure:</p> <p><strong><a href="https://youtu.be/sUE-X-D6RVg" data-url="https://youtu.be/sUE-X-D6RVg">Video: Honing and Stropping with Straight Razor</a></strong></p> <p>Note: This video has no dialogue.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/sUE-X-D6RVg/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Honing and Stropping with Straight Razor&amp;quot;" title="Honing and Stropping with Straight Razor" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If too hot, carefully sway the towel backwards and forwards while holding the top of the towel, then once again test the towel on your wrist to determine whether it is an acceptable temperature.</li> <li>Position yourself directly at the back of the chair, behind your client’s head. Place the hot towel under and over the client’s chin&nbsp;and fold&nbsp;upwards to client’s mouth and upper lip, leaving the towel to rest just under the nose.</li> <li>Place the right-hand side of the towel upwards across the temple and rest it across the forehead. Repeat the same towel placement with the left side. Leave a space for the nose, so that the client can breathe comfortably.</li> <li>With a gentle pressing motion, mold the towel to the client’s face, smoothing out the folds in the towel. The heat from the towel will open up the facial pores and begin the hair softening process.</li> <li>While the client is relaxing under the hot towel, take this time to prepare your lather product.</li> <li>Remove hot towel from your client’s face and apply a pre-shave lotion or gel. <em>This step is optional and based on the barber’s preference.</em></li> <li>Apply and equally distribute the lather product throughout the face and neck areas that are to be shaved.</li> <li>Work the shaving cream into a lather using swift circular movements as you work upwards from the right side of the neck towards the face. The exact same movements should be repeated on the left side, starting at the neck and up into the face. Clients have varying degrees of beard density and coarseness of hair, therefore, the time required for this step can vary from 1-2 minutes.</li> <li>Remove a second towel from the towel warmer, and again use your wrist to determine if the towel is an acceptable temperature before applying it to the client. With the lather left intact on the beard, apply the towel with gentle pressing motions to mold the towel to the client’s face. Allow the hot towel to remain while you prepare the razor for the shave.</li> <li>If using a single-use razor, disinfect the straight razor and insert a new blade. If using a conventional (reusable) straight razor, strop the razor if required.</li> <li>Simultaneously remove the towel while using it to remove the lather from the face in one fluid movement.</li> <li>Now that the first lather has been removed, apply a second application of lather to the areas to be shaved.</li> </ol> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_x08xz1wc" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_x08xz1wc">Video: Pre-Shave Preparation</a></strong></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_x08xz1wc/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Pre-Shave Prep Video&amp;quot;" title="Pre-Shave Prep Video" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The blade should be held consistently at a 30-degree angle.</p> <h2>The First Time Over Shave</h2> <ol><li>Begin in area 1, using the freehand stroke to move from the sideburn towards the jawbone and angle of the mouth.</li> <li>Follow with the backhand stroke in area 2. It is essential that your strokes are kept short; use your fine motor skills rather than your gross motor skills.</li> <li>From the upper lip, area 3, move towards the jawline with the freehand stroke.</li> <li>As you move toward the neck, area 4, use the reverse freehand technique. <div class="textbox">NOTE: Pay attention to the hair growth pattern in the neck area; some clients may have swirls or irregular growth patterns. It is essential to ensure that you are shaving with the grain.</div> </li> <li>Move to the opposite side of the client. Starting in the sideburn, use the backhand stroke, moving towards the jawbone and angle of the mouth.</li> <li>Make your way across the face areas while following the growth pattern; if the grain deviates, you may have to adjust the stroke direction.</li> <li>As you work across the chin, in area 11, it is crucial to stretch the skin using your opposite hand’s thumb and forefinger, as the skin in this area is typically thicker and tougher to shave.</li> <li>Move down the neck, areas 12 and 13, and continue to shave downwards and remain conscious of growth patterns. As you reach the Adam’s apple, you want to avoid shaving directly over top of it; stretch the skin to either side of the Adam’s apple before shaving the area.</li> <li>Move up to area 14, under the bottom lip. this area will be shaved entirely against the grain; the razor strokes move upwards towards the lip, to prevent the lip getting caught by the razor.</li> </ol> <h2>The Second Time Over</h2> <ol><li>Now that the first time over shave is complete, apply a warm (not hot) towel to the face to keep the skin warm.</li> <li>Remove the warm towel so the skin can be checked for rough spots or imperfections in the shave, use the towel to remove loose hairs or residual shaving lather.</li> <li>Apply a pre-shave oil or gel to the skin, continuing to check for spots that will require further shaving. Perform a second shave only in the areas that require it.</li> <li>Following the second time over shave, apply a cold towel to the face to soothe the skin, close the pores, and reduce irritation.</li> <li>Remove the towel, and use it to remove any loose hairs or excess pre-shave product that remains on the skin.</li> <li>Apply a small amount of aftershave to the freshly shaved skin. An aftershave with alcohol as an ingredient will act as an antiseptic and provide further encouragement for the pores to close.</li> </ol> <p>When the service is complete, the client’s skin should feel smooth, tacky, and free of any redness or bumps.
