Open Textbook project</a>.</p> <p>The B.C. Open Textbook project began in 2012 with the goal of making post-secondary education in British Columbia more accessible by reducing student cost through the use of openly licensed textbooks. The B.C. Open Textbook project is administered by BCcampus and funded by the British Columbia Ministry of Advanced Education.</p> <p>Open textbooks are open educational resources (OER); they are instructional resources created and shared in ways so that more people have access to them. This is a different model than traditionally copyrighted materials. OER are defined as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and re-purposing by others (<a href="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources" data-url="http://www.hewlett.org/programs/education/open-educational-resources">Hewlett Foundation</a>).</p> <p>Our open textbooks are openly licensed using a&nbsp;<a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons&nbsp;license</a>, and&nbsp;are offered in various e-book formats free of charge, or as printed books that are available at cost.</p> <p>For more information about this project, please contact&nbsp;<a href="mailto:opentext@bccampus.ca" data-url="mailto:opentext@bccampus.ca">opentext@bccampus.ca</a>.</p> <p>If you are an instructor who is using this book for a course, <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/">please let us know</a>.</p> </div></div>

This series was shepherded by Leanne Caillier-Smith (College of the Rockies) and benefited enormously from the insight and encouragement of Julia Dodge (University of the Fraser Valley), Chandra McCann (Okanagan College), Jan Weiten (Vancouver Community College), and Melinda Worfolk (College of New Caledonia). The above five mentioned are representatives of the BC Adult Literacy Articulation Committee and were the advisory committee members for this project. It has been a pleasure to scaffold my own learning among such brilliant and passionate educators.</p> <p>Huge thanks to Lauri Aesoph of BCcampus for introducing me to the exciting open textbook movement and managing all aspects of the publication of these books &nbsp;— from layout and image selection to copyediting and print –so adeptly.</p> <p>I am incredibly lucky to work with and have the support of the Basic Education Department at Vancouver Community College: Cynthia Bluman, Andrew Candela, Lynn Horvat, Alayna Kruger, Jo Lemay, Edie Mackenzie, Rene Merkel, Tara Mollel, Linda Rider, Mary Thompson-Boyd, Jan Weiten, our Program Assistant, Nadia Kawas, and our Dean, David Wells. I am also deeply grateful to the basic education students at Vancouver Community College for all that you teach me about dreams, resilience, and perseverance.</p> <p>A special thank you to my partner, Marria, for always lending my words an eager ear, and for keeping the world around me turning even though my head was perpetually stuck in these books.</p> </div></div>

My students tend to have plenty of knowledge of human rights issues from lived experience. These issues are often closely linked to the reasons they find themselves in&nbsp;my classroom.</p> <p>This reader contains nine original stories written specifically for adults, and is designed to accompany the <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf4/" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealf4/">BC Reads: Adult Literacy Fundamental English – Course Pack 4</a>.

But then her car broke down in New Glasgow. She decided to go see a movie while she waited for her car to be fixed. She went to the Roseland Theatre. It was a brick building with a big sign that lit up at night. She paid for a ticket and went inside. The theatre had a main floor and a balcony. Viola sat on the main floor because her eyesight was poor and she needed to be close to the screen.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_220" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955.jpg"><img class="wp-image-220" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955-300x201.jpg" alt="." width="300" height="201" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955-300x201.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955-225x151.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955-350x234.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/The_Hoyts_Regent_Theatre_ca1955.jpg 1000w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-220">Theatre</div></div> <p>Just as the movie started to play, she felt a tap on her shoulder. A staff person told her she could not sit there. Her ticket was for the balcony. Viola went back to the ticket booth. She asked for a ticket for the main floor. The ticket seller said, “We don’t sell tickets on the main floor to you people.” That’s when she realized that the balcony was for black people. The main floor was for white people. Viola said that she could not see from the balcony. She put the extra money for a main floor ticket on the counter. The ticket seller would not take it, but she went back to her seat anyway.</p> <p>That’s when the manager came. He told her to move to the balcony, or he would call the police. Viola told him to go ahead. She wasn’t moving. She was doing nothing wrong. Sure enough, the police came. They asked her one more time to move. Viola said no. So the police grabbed her by the arms and took her from the theatre. They had to drag her. “I just sort of went <strong><span class="glossary-term">limp</span></strong>,” Viola said. “I wasn’t going to make it easy for them.”</p> <p>The police took Viola to prison. She sat up awake the whole night.</p> <p>The next day, she was taken to court. Nobody had told her she could call a <strong><span class="glossary-term">lawyer</span></strong>, so she had to argue for herself.

But Viola bravely took the case back to court. Sadly, she lost once more. But Viola’s case brought people together to fight for equal rights in Nova Scotia. They kept up the battle, and, in 1954, the province finally got rid of the laws that made it legal to treat black people differently from white people.</p> <p>People of colour are now equal under the laws of Canada.

The summer sun was high in the sky. People sat on tablecloths spread over the green grass. They ate sandwiches and watermelon. They drank tea and lemonade. And boys were lining up for a race. The nine-year old girl wanted to run in that race. But she was told that races were for boys only. It was not nice for girls to run. Their skirts might fly up and their legs might show. A fire was lit inside her that day. One day, she would see to it that women could do the things that men could do — like vote. Her name was Nellie McClung.</p> <p>Running in races wasn’t the only thing girls weren’t allowed to do. Back then, it was illegal for women to vote, be in government, own property, or go to university. This is because men were thought to be more reasonable than women. Only men were reasonable enough to take part in the world of government and business. Women were seen as emotional. This made them “more fit” for the world of homemaking and childcare.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_34" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung.jpg"><img class="wp-image-34" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung.jpg" alt="." width="300" height="488" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung.jpg 450w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung-184x300.jpg 184w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung-65x106.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung-225x366.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Nellie_McClung-350x569.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-34">Nellie McClung</div></div> <p>When Nellie grew up, she poked holes in these old ideas. She spoke to large crowds in favour of women’s right to vote. Some Canadians worried that women’s rights would lead to the breakdown of the family. With a colourful hat on her head and a charming sense of humour, Nellie changed hearts and minds.</p> <p>Women’s rights activists in Europe and America often used violence to get their point across. Nellie used humour, instead. She starred in a play where she <strong><span class="glossary-term">debated</span></strong> men’s right to vote. She began by telling the men how nice they looked. Then she pointed out that most of the people in prison were men, and men made up only a small number of the people who went to church. How could these people be trusted with politics? Big crowds came to see Nellie’s play. They roared with laughter.

He was looking down on a huge crowd of workers protesting low wages. They could not give their families a good quality of life, even though they worked very hard. Suddenly, the police pulled out their guns&nbsp;and shot over 20 of the protesting workers. Two people died. Many more were hurt. Tommy was deeply affected by what he saw that day. He believed everyone should have&nbsp;a good quality of life, whether they were rich or poor. He thought it was wrong that people who fought for their rights were being killed.</p> <p>When he was 26, he became a minister so he could help people. His first job was in Saskatchewan. When the miners in his town went on strike, he brought them food and blankets. Once more, the police came in. They shot and killed three people. Tommy had seen enough. He decided to go into politics to make life better for poor people.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_40" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-40" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944.jpg"><img class="wp-image-40 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944-300x242.jpg" alt="." width="300" height="242" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944-300x242.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944-65x52.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944-225x182.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944-350x283.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Flag-Billboard-Forward_with_CCF_1944.jpg 400w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-40">Tommy Douglas joins the CCF</div></div> <p>He joined a <strong><span class="glossary-term">socialist</span></strong> party called the CCF. People tried to scare voters by saying he was a <strong><span class="glossary-term">communist</span></strong>. So Tommy told a story about a place called Mouseland. In Mouseland, the mice kept voting for fat black cats who made laws that were only good for cats. To make a change, next time the mice voted for the fat white cats. Of course, nothing changed. Finally one day, a mouse got the idea to vote for other mice. The story ends with everyone calling him a <strong><span class="glossary-term">communist</span></strong>! This story helped people understand socialism. The cats were like the rich people who were in government at the time. On the other hand, the mice were the working class people that Tommy wanted to see in government. With his bold ideas and ability to speak to a crowd, Tommy connected with voters. He became <strong><span class="glossary-term">premier</span></strong>&nbsp;of Saskatchewan in 1944.

At the time, only big cities had power for heat and lights. Tommy brought in power across the province. He made a law that bosses had to give workers at least two weeks of paid vacation. He made a bill of rights saying people of all races and genders are equal. The biggest change of all was that he brought in free health care for everyone in the province.</p> <p>Health care was personal for Tommy. When he was a young boy, he got an infection in his leg. His family was poor and could not afford health care. He was going to lose his leg. Thankfully, a doctor agreed to operate on his leg for free. Most people were not as lucky as he had been in his time of need. In 1959, Tommy brought in free health care for everyone in Saskatchewan, rich and poor. Before long, many people across Canada wanted the same health care rights that people in Saskatchewan had.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_170" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-170" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings.jpg"><img class="wp-image-170" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-1024x680.jpg" alt="." width="300" height="199" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-300x199.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-225x149.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings-350x233.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Canada_Parliament_Buildings.jpg 1600w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-170">Canada’s Parliament Buildings</div></div> <p>In 1961, Tommy was voted into the <strong><span class="glossary-term">federal</span></strong> government.

They were put onto a train and shipped to a camp in Slocan, British Columbia. The family had to live in a one-room shack. It was a heat trap in the summer and an ice box in the winter. Her family was forced to work on a farm. Joy had to work alongside them in the beet fields — often instead of going to school. She dreamed of going back to her home in Vancouver.</p> <p>After the war, Joy did not want to be thought of as Japanese. She thought of herself as a white person. It was a way of trying to forget the painful past. One day, Joy came across some letters. They were written by a Japanese Canadian woman from Vancouver and sent to her brother in Toronto. The letters were about how terrible it was to live in a time of so much racism. The writer called for justice. These letters gave Joy an idea. She decided to write a story based on what had happened to her family. She wrote a book called <em>Obasan</em>. As she wrote it, she began to accept herself as Japanese Canadian. And she began to want justice, too.</p> <p>Joy began to work for justice for the Japanese Canadians who had been put in camps. She worked with others to hold meetings, write letters, and organize rallies. Her book, <em>Obasan</em>, helped people across Canada to understand the terrible things that had happened. Finally, in 1988, the federal government said it was sorry for what had happened. It paid back part of what it had taken from Japanese Canadians. It promised to work to make sure such a terrible <strong>injustice</strong> never happens again.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_151" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z.jpg"><img class="wp-image-151" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z.jpg 640w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/7453300780_e06d0c1ff4_z-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-151">Joy Kogawa</div></div> <p>In 2005, Joy’s childhood house in Vancouver was going to be torn down.

Today, it is a word many people proudly use to describe themselves. The road to pride began with Jim Egan.</p> <p>Jim was born in Toronto in 1921. As a young man, he began visiting bars quietly known to be gay meeting places. He had to be careful. The police in Toronto often went to&nbsp;these places. They would trick&nbsp;gay men by pretending to be gay, too. Then they would arrest them. The men’s names would be printed in newspapers. They often lost their jobs, their family, and their friends. Landlords would not rent to them. Being gay meant being left out by the world. Jim met a man named Jack in one of those bars. They fell in love. The world seemed like a less lonely place.</p> <p>Jim loved to read. He noticed <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> people were being written about a lot more in the newspapers. But queer people were always talked about as being sick and immoral. This upset Jim. He could not stay silent. So, in 1949, he began writing letters to the newspapers. He protested the way they talked about gay people. He called for equal rights under the law. This was at a time when no one else was speaking up. Over the next 10 years, his letters appeared in many places, including <em>TIME</em> magazine.&nbsp;In 1963, a reporter from <em>Maclean’s</em> magazine wrote a story about Jim. It was the first positive report about <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> people by a major Canadian news company. Jim used a fake name to avoid arrest.</p> <p>Jack was uncomfortable with Jim’s <strong><span class="glossary-term">activism</span></strong>. He was worried that one day they might be thrown in jail. So Jim agreed to give up his <strong><span class="glossary-term">activism</span></strong>. They moved across the country to Vancouver Island and started a new life.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_172" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-172" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014.jpg"><img class="wp-image-172" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-1024x683.jpg" alt="Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014" width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014-350x233.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Marchers_at_Toronto_Pride_2014.jpg 1920w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-172">Activism</div></div> <p>In 1969, Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau finally got rid of the law that made <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> relationships illegal. Trudeau said, “There’s no place for the <strong><span class="glossary-term">state</span></strong> in the bedrooms of the nation.” Jim and Jack no longer had to worry about being put in prison.</p> <p>In the 1980s, AIDS began taking the lives of gay men. Gay men whose partners died of AIDS did not have the same rights as everyone else whose partners were sick or had passed away. Jim returned to <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> activism — and this time, Jack was right by his side. They helped run an AIDS organization. They also ran a drop-in group out of their home&nbsp;for <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> people.</p> <p>Jim retired in 1987. The government would not give him and Jack&nbsp;the same amount of money&nbsp;that married men and women get when they retire. Jim and Jack had been together for over 40 years. They took the government to court. It took eight years, but the courts made it illegal to <strong><span class="glossary-term">discriminate</span></strong> based on who people are in love with. This was the first time <strong><span class="glossary-term">queer</span></strong> people in Canada had human rights.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174" style="width: 325px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Wedding-chantelois-gomez-e1427066833581.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Wedding-chantelois-gomez-e1427066833581.jpg"><img class="wp-image-174" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Wedding-chantelois-gomez-e1427066833581.jpg" alt="a wedding of same gender couple" width="325" height="478" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-174">Wedding</div></div> <p>In 2005, Canada became the fourth country in the world to make&nbsp;same gender marriage legal.

A white man stepped out. He was sent by the government. His job was to take Elijah from his grandparents and bring him to <strong><span class="glossary-term">residential school</span></strong>, or boarding school. Elijah didn’t want to get on the plane, but he had no choice. At that time, First Nations people didn’t have any rights. They weren’t allowed to vote or be in government. The laws said that First Nations children had to go to residential school, so they would become more like white people.</p> <p>Elijah spent the next 10 years in residential school. The teachers cut his hair. They told him that the things he had learned from his grandfather were the ways of the <strong><span class="glossary-term">heathens</span></strong>, or godless people. He was punished if he tried to speak his own language. During that time, many of his classmates tried to run away.

Elijah had an idea. If he was in government, he could help First Nations people stand up for their rights. So, in 1981, he ran to be an <strong><span class="glossary-term">MLA</span></strong>, or member of the government. He won! He was the first <strong><span class="glossary-term">Aboriginal</span></strong> MLA in the history of Manitoba.</p> <p>Even as an MLA, it was hard to make change. The students who went to the residential schools didn’t know about their culture anymore. They didn’t feel like they belonged anywhere. They also had to deal with a lot of racism. Elijah was starting to feel powerless. But his chance to make a difference was just around the corner.</p> <p>In Ottawa, the prime minister of Canada wanted to pass a <strong><span class="glossary-term">bill</span></strong>, or a suggested law. The bill was supposed to help the country stay united. It said that Canada was created by the English and the French. It protected French language and culture. But it didn’t say anything about&nbsp;the role of First Nations people in building Canada. It did nothing to protect First Nations cultures or languages.</p> <p>The prime minister needed all of the MLAs in Manitoba to agree to the bill to make it a law. But when it was Elijah’s turn to vote, he held up an eagle feather and spoke the word, “No.” He felt that Canada had a duty to protect First Nations language and culture, too. With that, the prime minister’s bill did not pass.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-237" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o.jpg"><img class="wp-image-237" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o.jpg" alt="." width="450" height="301" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o.jpg 642w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o-300x201.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o-225x151.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/04/7287257186_66cdc99622_o-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-237">Elijah Harper (right) with Menno Wiebe</div></div> <p>A picture of Elijah holding an eagle feather was soon on the front page of newspapers across the country.

No matter what his mother did, he would not stop crying. So his mother called the doctor. The doctor told her that all of the Jewish babies he knew were crying. This was in Hungary during World War II. The <strong><span class="glossary-term">Nazis</span></strong> had taken over the country. They were doing terrible things to Jews. Gabor’s family was Jewish. The <strong><span class="glossary-term">Nazis</span></strong> had just killed Gabor’s grandparents. Gabor’s dad was forced to do hard work every day for the <strong><span class="glossary-term">Nazis</span></strong>. Gabor’s aunt was missing. Gabor was only a baby, so he could not have known these things. But he could probably feel his mother’s deep sadness and stress. So he cried and cried. The doctor could not really help.</p> <p>Today, Gabor Maté lives in Vancouver. He still struggles to feel at peace. He goes shopping to feel better. He spends lots of money on music records. His wife gets mad at him. They cannot afford for Gabor to keep buying new records. There is no space in their house for more records. But he can’t stop. Gabor has developed an addiction to shopping. An addiction is a strong and harmful need to do something.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_49" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-49" src="http://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-1024x768.jpg" alt="." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01-350x263.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/abealfreader4/wp-content/uploads/sites/91/2015/03/Gabor_Maté_-_01.jpg 1210w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-49">Gabor Maté</div></div> <p>Gabor is now a doctor and he works with people who have drug addictions.

For example, BC is home to a place called Insite. Drug users can get clean needles from Insite. They can also do drugs&nbsp;at Insite. If they overdose, a nurse will make sure they do not die. There is no other place like it in North America. When the government tried to close Insite, Gabor was one of many people who spoke out. Today, Insite’s doors are still open and it continues to save hundreds of lives.</p> <p>But as a doctor, Gabor Maté is not just saving lives.

Many people want to stand up for themselves, but don’t know where to start. If you decide to stand up for your rights, here are some questions that will help you make a plan:</p> <h1><strong>How are your rights being ignored?</strong></h1> <p>Write down your problem in a sentence. Here are some examples of human rights problems:</p> <ul><li>Someone at work often makes racist jokes. You have asked him or her to stop, but the problem continues.</li> <li>The bathroom in your house has had a mould problem for a long time, and your landlord will not fix it.</li> <li>The government raised the fees for your education, and you can no longer afford them.</li> <li>You receive <strong><span class="glossary-term">income assistance</span></strong>, and the money is not enough to meet your basic needs, like food and housing.</li> </ul> <h1><strong>What is your goal?</strong></h1> <p>Be clear about what you want to happen. For example:</p> <table style="height: 122px; width: 694px;"><tbody><tr><th>Problem</th> <th>Goal</th> </tr> <tr><td>Someone at work often makes racist jokes. You have asked him or her to stop, but the problem continues.</td> <td>Your boss will make a rule&nbsp;about workplace bullying. There will be training for staff members about safe work spaces.</td> </tr> <tr><td>The bathroom in your house has had a mould problem for a long time, and your landlord will not fix it.</td> <td>Your landlord will have repairs done in the next month.</td> </tr> <tr><td>The government raised fees for your education, and you cannot afford them.</td> <td>The government will put more money into education so the fees will be lower.</td> </tr> <tr><td>You receive <strong><span class="glossary-term">income assistance</span></strong>, and the money is not enough to meet your basic needs, like food and housing.</td> <td>The government will give more money to people on <strong><span class="glossary-term">income assistance</span></strong>.</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h1><strong>Who should you speak to?</strong></h1> <p>Always try to speak to the person who has&nbsp;<strong><span class="glossary-term">responsibility</span></strong> for the problem you face. Find out the “chain of command,” or levels of people who make decisions. If the first person in the chain of command does not help you, go up to the next person in the chain.</p> <h1><strong>What might get in your way?</strong></h1> <p>Be creative to find ways to deal with these <strong><span class="glossary-term">challenges</span></strong>.</p> <table style="height: 182px; width: 698px;"><tbody><tr><th>Challenge</th> <th>Solution</th> </tr> <tr><td>I don’t know enough about the problem.</td> <td>Find an <strong><span class="glossary-term">organization</span></strong> that tries to solve problems like yours. See if it has someone who can help you learn more.</td> </tr> <tr><td>I haven’t stood up for myself much&nbsp;before.</td> <td rowspan="3">Find a friend, a family member, or someone from an <strong><span class="glossary-term">organization</span></strong> who will&nbsp;help you with your writing&nbsp;or go with you to meetings.</td> </tr> <tr><td>English is my second language.</td> </tr> <tr><td>Fixing this problem will take more reading and writing skills than I have right now.</td> </tr> <tr><td>I worry that people will judge me.</td> <td>Think about what matters to you most. What do you need to do to stay true to the things you believe in?
