Participants included Caroline Daniels and Dr. Farhad Dastur (Kwantlen Polytechnic University), Inba Kehoe (University of Victoria), Dr. David Harper (University of the Fraser Valley), Lucas Wright (UBC), and Gail Morong (Thompson Rivers University).</p> <p>In the three years since then, open education has grown and matured in British Columbia and elsewhere. In response to those changes, information and links have been updated throughout this guide.</p> <p>Reported open textbook adoptions have grown in B.C. from a cumulative savings of $5 million in textbook costs in 2016 to over $13 million in 2019. This increase is the result of enhanced awareness and the acknowledged benefits of using these openly licensed resources; the ongoing creation and customization of quality open textbooks for the B.C. and Canadian post-secondary curricula; and better tracking of open textbook usage in the classroom. These factors, and BCcampus’ three additional years of experience in this area, have provided the knowledge and examples used for new material in this guide.</p> <p>This adoption guide is now divided into four parts. The first sections address three distinct groups involved in open textbook adoption: instructors, post-secondary institutions, and students. Section 1, Instructors: Adopt an Open Textbook is an updated carryover from the original guide, as is the last part called Learn More. The third section was written for students interested in taking an active role in advocating for open textbooks on their campus.</p> <p>The second and most expansive new section focuses on the why, what, and how aspects of open textbook adoption for individuals and institutions that support faculty in this area. It outlines the operational aspects of surveying instructors about, tracking usage of, and reporting about open textbooks (and other OER). This procedural information is based on BCcampus’ six years of experience working with faculty and open textbook adoptions. Many real life examples are included to illustrate how B.C.’s colleges, institutes, and universities have incorporated open textbook information into their course descriptions, bookstore order forms, library catalogues, and other institutional processes in an effort to standardize and simplify open textbook adoptions.</p> </div></div>

One <a href="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:Open_Education" data-url="http://wiki.ubc.ca/Documentation:Open_Education">useful definition of open education</a> comes from UBC, which define open education as a “collection of practices that utilize online technology to freely share knowledge.”</p> <p>Under the umbrella of open education, there are a number of specific ways in which this sharing of knowledge happens in higher education. These practices can include:</p> <ul><li>Publishing research in open journals (open access publishing)</li> <li>Releasing data to be reused by others (open data)</li> <li>Using, sharing and collaboratively creating software and computer code (open source software)</li> <li>Flexible admission policies to institutions or courses (open admissions or open registration)</li> <li>Student assignments that promote student publishing or participating on the open web (open teaching or open pedagogy)</li> <li>Sharing of teaching and research practices (open scholarship)</li> <li>Sharing and reuse of teaching and learning materials (open educational resources) including courses (open courseware) and textbooks (open textbooks)</li> </ul> <p>While this is not an exhaustive list, it should give you an idea of the types of activities that the phrase open education encompasses.</p> <h1>Why open?</h1> <p>While the above definition and list should give you an overview of the type of practices that open education encompass, it doesn’t answer the questions “Why Open?” and “Why do educators choose to take on these activities and call themselves open educators?”.</p> <p>To help answer the question Why Open?, please watch this TEDx Talk from Dr. David Wiley and read the article <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2z4C9xfPYsRNWdpcXc3a3RPQzA/view?usp=sharing" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B2z4C9xfPYsRNWdpcXc3a3RPQzA/view?usp=sharing">Openness in Education [PDF in Google Drive]</a> by David Wiley and Cable Green (video length is 14:55).</p> <p></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This section narrows the focus from open education to open educational resources (commonly referred to as OER) and, specifically, open textbooks.</p> <h1>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h1> <p>There are a number of different definitions for open educational resources, but they all contain similar elements.</p> <h2 style="text-align: left;">UNESCO</h2> <p><a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/" data-url="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/">UNESCO first defined the term open educational resources (OER)</a> in 2002 as teaching, learning or research materials that are in the public domain or released with an intellectual property license that allows for free use, adaptation, and distribution.</p> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Hewlett Foundation</h2> <p>The <a href="https://hewlett.org/strategy/open-educational-resources/" data-url="https://hewlett.org/strategy/open-educational-resources/">Hewlett Foundation defines OER</a> as teaching, learning, and research resources that reside in the public domain or have been released under an intellectual property license that permits their free use and repurposing by others. Open educational resources include full courses, course materials, modules, textbooks, streaming videos, tests, software, and any other tools, materials, or techniques used to support access to knowledge.</p> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Educause</h2> <p>A third definition comes from Educause. In their June 2010 white paper titled <a href="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2010/5/eli7061-pdf.pdf" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="https://library.educause.edu/-/media/files/library/2010/5/eli7061-pdf.pdf">7 things you should know about Open Educational Resources [PDF file]</a>, they define OER as “any resources available at little or no cost that can be used for teaching, learning, or research. The term can include textbooks, course readings, and other learning content; simulations, games, and other learning applications; syllabi, quizzes, and assessment tools; and virtually any other material that can be used for educational purposes. OER typically refers to electronic resources, including those in multimedia formats, and such materials are generally released under a Creative Commons or similar license that supports open or nearly open use of the content. OER can originate from colleges and universities, libraries, archival organizations, government agencies, commercial organizations such as publishers, or faculty or other individuals who develop educational resources they are willing to share.”</p> <h2 style="text-align: left;">The 5R Framework</h2> <p>Each of the above definitions of OER is built around the 5R framework. The <a href="https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221" data-url="https://opencontent.org/blog/archives/3221">5R framework</a>, developed by David Wiley, is a useful tool to help understand whether a teaching resource is, in fact, an open educational resource. The 5R framework defines the rights of a user over content, i.e., what a user must be able do with the content in order for it to be considered an OER.</p> <ol><li><strong>Retain</strong> — the right to make, own, and control copies of the content</li> <li><strong>Reuse</strong> — the right to reuse the content in its unaltered/verbatim form</li> <li><strong>Revise</strong> — the right to adapt, adjust, modify, or alter the content</li> <li><strong>Remix</strong> — the right to combine the original or revised content with other content to create something new</li> <li><strong>Redistribute</strong> — the right to make and share copies of the original content, a revision of the content, or remixes of the content with others</li> </ol> <h1>How open educational resources work</h1> <p>The following video was created by <a href="http://nadiamireles.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="http://nadiamireles.blogspot.com/">Nadia Mireles</a> and won third prize in a recent <a href="https://blog.ed.gov/2012/07/why-open-education-matters-video-competition-winners-announced/" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="https://blog.ed.gov/2012/07/why-open-education-matters-video-competition-winners-announced/">U.S. Department of Education open education video contest</a> (video length is 3:31).

These licences allow creators to give permission for others to use their work under certain conditions.</p> <p>Every time a work is created, such as when a journal article is written or a photograph taken, that work is automatically protected by copyright. Copyright protection prevents others from using the work in certain ways, such as copying the work or putting the work online.</p> <p>A CC licence allows the creator of a work to select how they want others to use the work. When a creator releases their work under a CC licence, members of the public know what they can and can’t do with the work. This means that they only need to seek the creator’s permission when they want to use the work in a way not permitted by the licence.</p> <p>The great thing is that all CC licences allow works to be used for educational purposes.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-open-textbook-evaluation" title="Evaluate"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">9</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Evaluating an Open Textbook</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Evaluating an open textbook is similar to evaluating any textbook. To begin, let’s look at the qualities that make a good textbook, whether it’s open or not.</p> <h1>What are the qualities of a good textbook?</h1> <p>You have probably reviewed many textbooks in your career and have your own set of evaluation guidelines. Before we begin looking at the criteria that various open textbook projects are using to evaluate the textbooks in their collections, let’s review some of the qualities and structures that make up a textbook.</p> <h2>Pedagogical aids for textbooks</h2> <p>When it comes to textbooks, there is no doubt that the content of the book is important. You want to be sure that the content in the textbook aligns with the learning outcomes of your course and that the content is written at the right level for your learners.</p> <p>However, a good textbook is more than a collection of facts. Textbooks also contain a number pedagogical aids, which are features or attributes of the book that help a learner understand the content being presented.</p> <p>There are a number of common pedagogical aids in textbooks, including:</p> <ul><li>Chapter objectives</li> <li>Chapter learning outcomes</li> <li>Chapter outlines</li> <li>Chapter summaries or reviews</li> <li>Checklists</li> <li>Headings and subheadings</li> <li>Bold and italicized text</li> <li>Tables of contents</li> <li>Tables of figures</li> <li>Indexes</li> <li>Focus questions and practice questions</li> <li>Case studies, vignettes, and examples of best practices</li> <li>Glossary and key terms</li> <li>Demonstrations and simulations</li> <li>Maps and timelines</li> <li>Illustrations, including photos, charts, diagrams, and figures</li> <li>Multimedia</li> <li>Pronunciation guides</li> </ul> <h3 style="text-align: left;">Usefulness of pedagogical aids in textbooks</h3> <p>Of these pedagogical aids, which are the ones that students actually use and find useful? Weiten, Guadagno &amp; Beck (1996) surveyed 134 students asking them how familiar they were with the different pedagogical aids in their textbooks.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-1"></span></span> They also asked the students the probability they would use each pedagogical aid and their perceived value of each aid. With their research, Weiten, Guadagno, and Beck showed that the top three pedagogical aids that students used in textbooks were boldfaced technical terms, chapter and section summaries, and glossaries.</p> <p>In his 2003 research Pedagogical Aids and Student Performance, Gurung surveyed more than 200 undergraduate students and asked them to rate the usefulness of 10 pedagogical aids and instructional techniques. <span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="69-2"></span></span>Gurung’s research wasn’t specific to textbook aids, but did include a number of textbook-specific aids, like outlines, chapter summaries and reviews, boldfaced and italicized terms, and key terms and practice questions found in textbooks. When you eliminate the non-textbook–related aids from Gurung’s research, we find that the top textbook aids used by students were boldfaced terms, italicized terms, and practice questions. Chapter summaries and reviews was a very close fourth.</p> <p>In terms of helpfulness, students rated boldfaced (92%) and italicized (81%) terms as the most useful pedagogical aids, followed by practice test questions (77%) and chapter summaries and reviews (73%) as being moderately to extremely helpful.</p> <p>So, as we can see, it is often the simplest aids, like bold and italicized terms and chapter summaries and outlines, that are most often used by students.</p> <h2>Textbook structure</h2> <p>Another consideration when reviewing a textbook is to take a close look at the way the content is structured. A good textbook should follow some basic rules of structure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_68" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68" style="width: 600px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2016/04/BookSprint.jpg" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2016/04/BookSprint.jpg"><img class="wp-image-68" src="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2016/04/BookSprint-1024x639.jpg" alt="5 rules of textbook development.

For the most part, the criteria you would use to judge the effectiveness of an open textbook would be the same as any textbook. However, there are some unique criteria that you might want to consider for open textbooks that may not apply to a closed textbook. Some of the additional items you may want to consider when evaluating an open textbook are:</p> <ul><li>Can I modify or edit the book to meet my needs, and if so, does the licence allow me edit or modify the book?</li> <li>Is the open textbook available in a technical format that I can edit, if I want to modify it?</li> <li>Is there supplementary material available for the textbook? For some faculty, supplementary resources are important components of a textbook adoption. While some open textbooks do have supplementary materials associated with them, many do not. This may or may not be an issue for you.</li> <li>Is there a community to support the open textbook? Often, these communities can help provide support for you in your adoption. If you have a problem or concern, or are just looking to connect with others who are using the same resource, a well-developed community can help provide support for your adoption. For example, Stitz-Zeager’s <a href="http://www.stitz-zeager.com/forum.html" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="http://www.stitz-zeager.com/forum.html">open pre-calculus textbook website</a> has a community with discussion forums and blogs that can help provide some support for your adoption. <a href="http://writingcommons.org/" rel="nofollow noopener" data-url="http://writingcommons.org/">The Writing Commons</a> is another example of an open textbook with a community associated with it.</li> </ul> <h1>Open textbook review criteria</h1> <p>Increasingly, open textbook projects are placing a greater emphasis on having peer-reviewed materials in their collection to help faculty with adoption and address concerns some have about the quality of open textbooks. A number of open textbook projects have created criteria for evaluating and reviewing open textbooks and OER collections.</p> <ul><li><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2019/09/BC-Open-Textbooks-Review-Rubric-7.docx" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/wp-content/uploads/sites/143/2019/09/BC-Open-Textbooks-Review-Rubric-7.docx">BCcampus open textbooks review rubric [Word file]</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J0oT1xZCciyXtk1I7MB_r9saVDHlpQD7Ml5Ep9uCLfM/edit" data-url="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1J0oT1xZCciyXtk1I7MB_r9saVDHlpQD7Ml5Ep9uCLfM/edit">Faculty checklist for evaluating course materials</a></li> <li><a href="https://bcoel.ca/resources/oer-finding-tools/" data-url="https://bcoel.ca/resources/oer-finding-tools/">Open education resource repository rubric</a></li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center;">Discussion Prompts</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>After reviewing the qualities of a good textbook and the criteria others use to review textbooks, consider what criteria are most important to you when choosing learning resources for your class.</p> <ul><li>Do you have an articulated set of criteria you use when picking a textbook? What criteria do you use when choosing a textbook?</li> <li>What are other important criteria that are missing from the list?</li> <li>What do you think are the most important qualities of a textbook? Why?</li> <li>Thinking about textbooks you have used in the past, what do you like and not like about them?</li> <li>Do you think the important criteria, considerations, and qualities are different for printed books than for digital books?</li> </ul> </div> </div> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="5rules">5 rules of textbook development long description:</strong> An infographic of the 5 rules of textbook development, which are as follows:</p> <ol><li>Rule of Frameworks <ul><li>Maintain a consistent structure. The text can best aid understanding by making this framework visible early on. The framework acts as a <strong>mental roadmap</strong> that allows learners to navigate within and through the subject domain.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Rule of Meaningful Names <ul><li>Create and use consistent titles and terminologies. These names are critical to the ability to recall or retrieve the things we know and remember. Use terminology that is <strong>common in your discipline.</strong></li> </ul> </li> <li>Rule of Manageable Numbers <ul><li>Limit the amount of new information introduced at one time. Most of us are limited in our ability to absorb new material. As we become familiar with part of a subject domain, this number expands. For new material, <strong>four to six</strong> new elements is a reasonable limit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Rule of Hierarchy <ul><li>New knowledge builds on learned knowledge. The student needs to understand the foundational knowledge before being introduced to a new concept. When new concepts are introduced, they should be explicitly connected to the foundational material. When introducing new material, only refer to foundational material if it is <strong>relevant</strong> to the new material.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Rule of Repetition <ul><li>Repeat important concepts. There is a pattern of repetition that aids in promoting the elements of a subject from short-term to long-term memory. Frameworks and important hierarchies are repeated as many as <strong>five or six</strong> times. Frequently used elements are repeated <strong>three or four</strong> times. Elements of lesser utility <strong>may not be repeated</strong> at all.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p><a href="#attachment_68" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/adoptopentextbook/chapter/open-textbook-evaluation/#attachment_68">[Return to 5 rules of textbook development]</a></p> <h1>Attributions</h1> <p><strong>5 rules of textbook development</strong></p> <p>This work is used under a CC BY licence.</p> <p>This work is based upon <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Textbook_considerations" data-url="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Textbook_considerations">Wikibooks:Textbook considerations</a> by various authors and released under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ca/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/2.0/ca/">CC BY-SA 2.0 Canadian Licence</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PSM_V46_D167_Outer_surface_of_the_human_brain.jpg" data-url="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PSM_V46_D167_Outer_surface_of_the_human_brain.jpg">Outer surface of the human brain</a> is in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">public domain</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://pixabay.com/vectors/brain-anatomy-man-mind-people-154297/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/vectors/brain-anatomy-man-mind-people-154297/">Brain Anatomy</a> by OpenClips is in the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/mark/1.0/">public domain</a>.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='69-1'>Wayne Weiten, Rosanna E.

They will have the option to select which file type they would like to download, or they can purchase a low-cost printed version from the <a href="http://open.bccampus.ca/2013/11/25/print-on-demand-now-available-for-open-textbooks/" data-url="http://open.bccampus.ca/2013/11/25/print-on-demand-now-available-for-open-textbooks/">BCcampus print-on-demand service</a>.</li> <li>Alternatively, you can download copies of the book and put them on another site. Some examples of where you could put your own copies of the book files are: <ul><li>Your institutional LMS (learning management system). Load the book files into your Moodle, Desire2Learn, Blackboard, or Canvas site and make the books available to your students via the LMS.</li> <li>Use an online file-sharing service like Dropbox or Google Drive. Upload copies of the book files to Dropbox or Google Drive and send your students the link to that copy.</li> <li>If you have a faculty website, put copies of the files on that website and send students to your website to download your copy of the textbook.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2 style="text-align: left;">Print copies</h2> <p>While most students will choose a free electronic version of the textbook, some may prefer a print copy. If you wish to make print copies of your book available, check with your institutional print shop to see if they have the ability to create print versions of the textbook on site for your students. Many institutional print shops can create low-cost printed versions of textbooks and make them available to students.</p> <p>Keep in mind that textbooks that have a specific non-commercial clause (CC BY-NC) cannot be sold with a markup or at a profit. However, charging a cost-recovery fee for print textbooks is considered reasonable.</p> <h1>Report your adoption</h1> <p>Instructors in British Columbia who use an open textbook in the classroom are encouraged to complete and submit the BCcampus <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/use-open-textbooks/tell-us-youre-using-an-open-textbook/">Adoption Form</a>.

In fact, BCcampus Open Education is&nbsp;required to track these adoptions as part of its accountability agreement with B.C.’s <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/advanced-education-skills-training" data-url="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/organizational-structure/ministries-organizations/ministries/advanced-education-skills-training">Ministry of Advanced Education and Skills Training</a>.</p> <p>Statistics involve the collection, organization, and interpretation of numerical data from a representative sample from which trends are drawn for the targeted population as a whole. In the case of adoption statistics published for B.C., it is understood that the numbers are not based on <em>all</em> open textbook usage in the province. Instead, it’s acknowledged that these data provide a <em>snapshot</em> of how many students, instructors, and institutions are using open textbooks and approximately how much money is saved.</p> <h1>More than numbers</h1> <p>At BCcampus, this work has proven to be about more than just numbers. Tracking adoptions has helped the open education team connect with and support faculty and staff interested in open education. Paying attention to who is using open textbooks has revealed open education trends within B.C.’s post-secondary sector and made it easier to bring together individuals and groups working in this area. On the flip side, talking with instructors who have chosen <em>not</em> to adopt an open textbook has been equally valuable, especially when they explain the reasons why.</p> <p>Institutions preparing to embark on an adoption-tracking project can record the benefits they expect to gain from this endeavour. Taking this step will clarify for the group why they are doing this work as well as provide a blueprint for future reference.</p> <p>Aside from developing and maintaining a detailed record of open textbook usage over time, the act of discovering and tracking adoptions at an institution offers these perks:</p> <ul><li>A way to introduce faculty, students, and staff to open education</li> <li>An opportunity to survey non-adopting instructors about open textbook interest</li> <li>A step toward operationalizing open education on campus</li> </ul> <div class="textbox shaded" style="text-align: center;">For more information, see <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/track-adoptions/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/track-adoptions/">Track Adoptions</a> in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em>.</div> </div></div>

Without these, it is impossible to clearly and accurately track and interpret adoption data. Additionally, look for a balance between compiling data that’s useful and making it onerous for faculty who are submitting adoption information. Here are questions that can guide these decisions.</p> <ul><li>How will this information be used?</li> <li>Will the numbers be manipulated in a formula or as part of a statistical analysis? If so, what information is required?</li> <li>How difficult is it for those filling out an adoption form to obtain the information?</li> <li>How important is it that requested values be exact? Are estimates acceptable?</li> <li>Does it make sense to offer a range of values for particular values?</li> <li>Will adoptions be reported for a typical school year, starting in September, or the calendar year?</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center;">Adoption Definitions</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>BCcampus Open Education uses the below terms in its adoption reports.

A faculty member is only counted once.</p> <p><strong>Savings:&nbsp;</strong>Savings include a range. The number at the lower end is calculated as follows: number of students (see “Students”)&nbsp;× $100. (This number was derived by OpenStax based on a formula that takes into account used textbook purchases and rental costs as well as new textbook costs.)</p> <p>The number at the upper end is calculated as follows: number of students (see “Students”)&nbsp;× actual cost of the textbook being replaced if purchased as hard copy and new.</p> <p><strong>Students:&nbsp;</strong>The total number of students in all course sections within which an open textbook is used as the primary educational resource.</p> </div> </div> <h1>BCcampus’ decisions</h1> <p>From the beginning, BCcampus has taken a conservative approach to adoption tracking by determining it was better to under-report open textbook usage rather than overestimate, especially in cases of uncertainty. Well-defined parameters were established early in the process, making statistics collection easier. For example, it was decided that:</p> <ul><li><em>Only</em> open textbooks would be counted, not other open educational resources</li> <li>Open textbooks must be adopted as the <em>primary</em> course resource, and open textbooks assigned as optional, supplementary, or secondary readings were not to be included</li> <li>Course registration numbers must reflect <em>enrolled</em> students, not seats available</li> </ul> <p>Based on these decisions, any instructors using open textbooks are asked to fill out the BCcampus <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/adoption-of-an-open-textbook/" rel="noopener" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/adoption-of-an-open-textbook/">Adoption Form</a> and provide the following information. (However, only information provided by B.C. faculty are published as adoption stats on the <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/">BCcampus OpenEd</a> website.)</p> <ul><li>Instructor’s name and email address</li> <li>Institution name</li> <li>Name of adopted open textbook</li> <li>Cost of textbook replaced by the open textbook</li> <li>Course name and code for which the open textbook is used</li> <li>Number of sections for this course</li> <li>Number of students enrolled per course section</li> <li>Terms (past, current, future) used (reporting retroactive adoptions is encouraged)</li> </ul> <p>Adopters are also asked if their information may be shared with other faculty interested in open textbook adoptions and if their information may be published on the <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca">BCcampus OpenEd</a> website as part of adoption reporting. Before submitting the form, it is disclosed that: “By submitting this form, you give BCcampus permission to share this information with faculty, staff, and students at your identified institution.”</p> <h1>Posted statistics</h1> <p>Submitted information is automatically calculated and posted on the BCcampus <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/advocate-for-open-education/open-textbook-stats/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/advocate-for-open-education/open-textbook-stats/">Open Textbooks Stats</a> page. Here are some of the statistics posted on that page.</p> <ol><li>A range of student savings based on the number of participating students where the textbook displacement cost is set at $100 to the actual retail price</li> <li>Number of B.C. students using open textbooks</li> <li>Number of B.C. institutions adopting open textbooks</li> <li>Top five adoption institutions (in order, starting with that with the highest number of adoptions)</li> <li>Number of known B.C. faculty using an open textbook in their course</li> <li>Total number of known adoptions</li> </ol> <p>BCcampus publishes province-wide anonymized statistics; public records are not provided for individual colleges, institutes, or universities, instructors, courses, years, or terms. Numbers are cumulative and cover adoptions for the duration of the BCcampus Open Education project. Individual institutions may request adoption statistics for their specific community; these records mark each adoption by term and year, along with other details.</p> <h1>Round peg, square hole</h1> <p>Even when an adoption collection system is ideal, situations arise that challenge the status quo. For example, BCcampus must collection information from dozens of institutions—colleges, institutes, universities—some with an academic schedule that does not follow the common semester or term system. Courses that use the continuous intake model are also a challenge. Recognizing that one adoption form (and the technology behind it) does not—and in some cases, cannot—fit all situations, BCcampus does its best to adjust these “round pegs” to fit in its adoption form’s square holes.</p> <p>Another situation is how and when to count students. Is it best to use the number of seats available in a course section, or to wait until a final number is available for enrolled students? If so, at what point in the term should this information be collected? At one B.C. institution, student numbers used too late in the term do not include students who have withdrawn. Does this matter? Is it assumed that a student who enrols but withdraws has purchased a textbook? Again, learning to roll with the punches and doing one’s best to capture these data can be the solution without making it too difficult or complicated for faculty to report their usage.</p> <p>One university that identifies classes using some or all free resources wondered if these tags would serve as useful adoption markers. As their system was currently set up, there was no easy way to differentiate between hybrid usage (OER and fee-based commercial material), free resources that are not OER (such as library resources), and course sections that solely used open textbooks or other open educational resources.</p> <h1>Remember the “why”</h1> <p>Regardless of the approach taken to report stats, it’s important to remember <a href="#chapter-why-track" data-url="/adoptopentextbook/chapter/why-track/">the <em>why</em> behind tracking adoptions</a>. If the purpose includes engaging instructors, then there’s value in tracking both primary and supplementary usage of open textbooks as well as those that are offered as optional reading. Several B.C. institutions participating in the <a href="#chapter-ongoing-adoptions" data-url="/adoptopentextbook/chapter/ongoing-adoptions/">Ongoing Adoption Program</a> operate this way.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title" style="text-align: center;">Other Adoption Forms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>For a glimpse at how other groups are tracking open textbook adoptions, see below.</p> <ul><li>eCampusOntario: <a href="https://openlibrary.ecampusontario.ca/report-an-adoption/" data-url="https://openlibrary.ecampusontario.ca/report-an-adoption/">Share an Adoption (OER)</a></li> <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn_ztbbriZXptbz-u49pA2OpVvKI17H3VElhguxx0Ky1KSJg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1" data-url="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScn_ztbbriZXptbz-u49pA2OpVvKI17H3VElhguxx0Ky1KSJg/viewform?c=0&amp;w=1">Open SUNY Textbook Adoption</a></li> <li><a href="https://openstax.org/" data-url="https://openstax.org/">OpenStax</a>:&nbsp;<a href="https://openstax.org/adoption" data-url="https://openstax.org/adoption">OpenStax adoption form</a></li> </ul> </div> </div> </div></div>

Much depends on the culture of the college or university and at what stage the institution is in terms of open educational awareness and practice.</p> <p>For some institutions, particularly at the start, tracking adoptions might be as simple as learning about open textbook usage during conversations with instructors. Others conduct routine surveys each term. The advantages of this second method include:</p> <ol><li>Keeping the conversation about open education alive</li> <li>Learning how OER and open textbook usage is changing on campus (e.g., are new or the same resources being used; which instructors are participating, dropping out, or joining; which disciplines and course levels are involved, and which are not, and why)</li> <li>Discovering how the institution can do better or help its faculty, staff, and students in this area (e.g., through the <a href="#chapter-ongoing-adoptions" data-url="/adoptopentextbook/chapter/ongoing-adoptions/">B.C. Ongoing Adoption Program</a>)</li> </ol> <p>Setting up a streamlined adoption procedure with steps and dates gives faculty an established system so they can report their open textbook adoptions on time. That data can then be provided to people and departments (OER team, bookstore, course scheduler, adoption tracker, accessibility department) that need it for the integration of and information about open textbooks in use.&nbsp;<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="291-1"></span></span></p> <p>Below is a list of other methods used in B.C. and elsewhere to track open textbook adoptions.</p> <ul><li><strong>Provide workshops, lunchtime (brown bag) sessions, or other educational events</strong> about open education, open textbooks, and open educational resources (OER). During these sessions, ask faculty if they are currently using or considering adopting an open textbook in their course. Sometimes, institutions report that instructors are using OER and are not aware they are doing so. Several B.C. institutions have scheduled these events, such as the <a href="https://tlc.ecuad.ca/exploring-open-education-workshop-friday-sept-9th-1200-130pm-emily-carr-library/" data-url="https://tlc.ecuad.ca/exploring-open-education-workshop-friday-sept-9th-1200-130pm-emily-carr-library/">OER workshop at Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design</a> and a <a href="https://www.vcc.ca/media/vancouver-community-college/content-assets/documents/vice-president-academic/Ed-Tech-2018-Speakers-Bios.pdf" data-url="https://www.vcc.ca/media/vancouver-community-college/content-assets/documents/vice-president-academic/Ed-Tech-2018-Speakers-Bios.pdf">session on OER at a daylong event at Vancouver Community College [PDF file]</a>.</li> <li><strong>Share potential open textbooks and other OER with faculty</strong> that might be used in their courses.

If it is routine for faculty to inform the bookstore which textbook has been assigned to a course, ask if open textbooks can be included (even though they are free).

Why would I switch?”</h1> <p>Faculty who are unhappy with their current textbook may be more inclined to implement an open textbook. But what about faculty who are satisfied with their current $150 textbook and feel strongly that it is the best course material available? Answer: “Students can’t learn from textbooks they don’t have” <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/thesheck/running-effective-oer-and-open-textbook-programs-at-your-academic-library-acrl2017?qid=c6a6e3a2-5ad0-4843-848f-b651c4a37f81&amp;v=&amp;b=&amp;from_search=1" data-url="https://www.slideshare.net/thesheck/running-effective-oer-and-open-textbook-programs-at-your-academic-library-acrl2017?qid=c6a6e3a2-5ad0-4843-848f-b651c4a37f81&amp;v=&amp;b=&amp;from_search=1">(Allen and Cohen 2017).</a> No matter how effective that textbook is or how renowned the author is in the field, if students cannot afford it, or resort to part-time access to the textbook (i.e., library reserves or borrowing it from a friend), they are very likely not learning from it, nor will it become a fixture on their bookshelf for future reference. Despite a faculty members’ best intentions, student attitudes about the longevity of their textbooks have changed; cost more often supersedes value and students are choosing temporary course materials if they are more affordable. Librarians having this discussion can ask faculty if the majority of their students have the textbook in the first week of classes (they probably do not), or how often students seem to fall behind because they are not reading the textbook. This conversation, even with a resistant faculty member, may bring awareness to issues of textbook affordability and how that challenge is playing out in their classroom. The faculty member who wrote off poor performance because “they are not reading the textbook” may now start to wonder if the real issue is that students are not buying the textbook. If faculty are adamant about keeping their expensive textbook, there are other alternatives to get them acquainted with OER. Librarians can share with faculty OER they find that coincide with course requirements or look for faculty members from other institutions using OER for a similar course. Librarians may also ask faculty to consider including an open access (OA) article in their course readings or to listen to an online lecture from an OER repository. Offering small methods for implementing OER may persuade faculty over time to support and implement OER for a single class or more. Exposure to high quality OER can help overcome one of the biggest barriers to faculty adoptions: concerns about quality.</p> <h1><a id="notextbook" data-url=""></a>“We’re only using half of this textbook, but there’s nothing that really fits my class” or “I don’t use a textbook.”</h1> <p>These comments may come from faculty members <em>or</em> students and are a prime opportunity to begin a conversation about the benefits of OER. Unlike faculty who are perfectly happy with the standard text in their field, those who already recognize that existing commercial textbooks do not meet the needs of their course are well situated to consider an open textbook or a remix of openly licensed materials. Move the conversation beyond the issue of affordability (which is not an issue in a class where the instructor does not require a textbook purchase) and into the flexibility of open content. Explain to the faculty member that chapters from open textbooks can be remixed with chapters from other open textbooks or various OER. Unlike a commercial textbook with a fixed and immutable organization and structure, faculty using open textbooks have the freedom to modify and reorganize the content of an open textbook. Many faculty who are motivated by affordability to switch to OER find that what they ultimately appreciate most is the flexibility and adaptability of the resources: the content can be customized to best meet the needs of the students rather than having to adjust the syllabus to fit the commercial textbook. Although truly open materials are the most flexible and give students the opportunity to own their education forever, sometimes using traditional textbooks or articles from library subscribed resources will also save students money. Faculty tend to use what they are used to and they keep assigning the same textbook, when really only a couple of chapters are relevant or valuable to their curriculum. Librarians can suggest meeting with reserves staff and see if it is possible to put those one or two chapters on reserve with appropriate copyright permissions, and then guide faculty through various OER repositories to find supplemental material that will add to their curriculum. Faculty who do not use a traditional textbook can be encouraged to integrate scholarly articles they find in the library’s electronic resources. Although not open—or free for that matter—these resources are free to students and introduce faculty to the idea of remixing resources.</p> <h1><a id="afford" data-url=""></a>“What’s a $150 textbook in the grand scheme of the cost of college?” or “They can afford it.”</h1> <p>Related to these comments is an expectation among some faculty that “I did it, so they should too.” Like many aspects of higher education in the twenty-first century, however, the textbook market has changed dramatically from when many of us and our colleagues were undergrads, as has the overall cost of attending college. For many students, the sticker-shock of college textbooks comes to them as an unexpected cost. Although institutions are now required to disclose to potential students how much they should budget for books and supplies, this cost is often not real to students until they are standing in the bookstore looking at the overwhelming number of options, most of which they consider completely unaffordable. Although the cost of one textbook for one course might seem insignificant in the grand scheme of higher education costs, a student taking a full course load may need to budget well over $1,000 for all of the required textbooks, and this unexpected financial obligation could be the breaking point for a student or family that is already struggle to afford a college education <a href="https://uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/NATIONAL%20Fixing%20Broken%20Textbooks%20Report1.pdf" data-url="https://uspirg.org/sites/pirg/files/reports/NATIONAL%20Fixing%20Broken%20Textbooks%20Report1.pdf">(Senack 2014)</a>. Librarians can share with faculty the study by Student PIRGs, which found that 65 percent of students decided against buying a required textbook because it was too expensive, and that nearly all of the students that did so admitted being concerned that not having the required textbook would affect their grades. Even at institutions where students are less likely to be struggling financially or where they are not mandated by the state to consider lower-priced course reading options, there will always be a number of students who would benefit from courses with free or low-priced course reading. Additionally, it is important to educate faculty that although students at their particular institution can afford the cost of textbooks, the OER movement goes beyond their classroom and their students. A highly effective method for communicating to faculty the reality of students’ textbook behaviors is to interview actual students about their experiences. If possible, librarians and OER advocates can record videos of students describing how they obtain textbooks, what influences them to purchase a textbook or not, how often they use a textbook when they do or do not purchase it, and what creative means they use to avoid paying for a textbook they consider overpriced. Hearing directly from students can deliver a powerful message that might surprise some faculty into thinking twice about how OER might be an attractive option for their course.</p> <h1><a id="supplement" data-url=""></a>“What about all the supplemental materials my current publisher provides?”</h1> <p>Fortunately as the OER movement gains momentum and faculty teaching high enrollment courses recognize the benefit to students of providing free and open course materials, this issue can be less of a concern for faculty in certain disciplines. When a faculty member relies on publisher materials that accompany a textbook, the answer may be to recommend looking for existing open textbooks and related platforms, many of which now have available instructor slides, quizzes, test banks, and other supplemental materials. For example, math faculty may consider switching to MyOpenMath (https://www.myopenmath.com/), an alternative to Pearson’s MyLab Math (https://www.pearsonmylabandmastering.com/). Additionally, other platforms built on open resources, such as Libretexts (https://libretexts.org/) and WebWork (http://webwork.maa.org/index.html), also contain helpful supplemental materials. Faculty may also be concerned about cheating when materials are so “openly available”; in these situations, librarian advocates may need to help faculty face the harsh reality that every answer to every problem and test bank provided by their commercial publisher is available somewhere online for the enterprising cheater to find. Cheng and Crumbley (2018) find that close to half of the students in a course had used a publisher test bank to memorize question-specific cues and the correct answers, and those students performed significantly better on exams. Perhaps the answer, “they’re doing it anyway” is not the best to give, but concerns about increased cheating due to the openness of course materials can be alleviated through educating faculty on the reality of students’ cheating behaviors. If a funding source has been identified and librarians are advocating for course conversion projects, they can ask faculty how many others teaching the same course would be willing to work on OER adoption and try to put together a team who can create the materials that will no longer be available from publishers. Successful OER projects and initiatives are team efforts, including individuals other than teaching faculty who may also be able to contribute to the creation of supplemental materials. Librarians themselves can assist faculty in locating multimedia content—open or licensed—that can be embedded in course management systems. Instructional designers can be instrumental in assisting with the creation and accessibility requirements of materials beyond the textbook. Teams of faculty can divide up the work of creating test bank questions, instructor slides, review packets, and whatever else is needed. Course leads or coordinators may have come to rely on publisher ancillaries to ensure that adjunct/contingent faculty are prepared with the necessary materials to teach a class even on short notice; a team of faculty who takes the time to develop those ancillaries for an OER course can then roll out that course package to any other faculty member in much the same way publisher materials would be provided. Librarians can also play an important role in helping faculty store and share those materials for wider use and should consider offering those services as they are having this conversation with a faculty member.</p> <h1><a id="budgets" data-url=""></a>“Budgets are tight. Why should I allocate money to faculty stipends for OER?”</h1> <p>If selecting course materials is considered part of a faculty member’s professional responsibility, administrators may not understand why they are being asked to fund faculty stipends for OER adoption and creation. Librarians who are advocating for funding to support OER should be prepared to explain how an incentive (either in the form of stipend, time, or professional recognition) is important in moving an OER initiative forward. Oftentimes, it is easier for faculty to choose a popular textbook because looking for other resources takes time. Varying degrees of monetary stipends can compensate faculty for the significant amount of time that is typically required to replace course materials with OER, sometimes up to as much as forty hours of work. OER advocates recognize that “instructors feel pressed for time” and “colleges need to show they understand that before asking them to embrace a shift away from textbooks” <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/04/26/faculty-member-and-librarians-discuss-how-college-makes-progress" data-url="https://www.insidehighered.com/digital-learning/article/2017/04/26/faculty-member-and-librarians-discuss-how-college-makes-progress">(Jaschik 2017)</a>; stipends are such a demonstration. Before librarians discuss funding with administration, it is crucial to have the library director or dean on board and helpful to have a few faculty members who already embrace OER. Particularly when asking for monetary stipends from potential funding sources outside of the institution, librarians can demonstrate the significant return on investment (ROI) afforded by OER adoptions. Consider a $3,000 stipend awarded to a faculty member who is currently using a $150 textbook. If there are forty students in each section and the faculty member teaches three sections in one semester, the student savings for that semester will be $18,000. (Yes, it is unlikely that all of those students would have purchased a new textbook for the course, but let’s go for the big win on this one.) Identify likely adopters and calculate the potential ROI to share with possible funding sources. Get really creative and pitch OER stipends to donors as a scholarship that is awarded not just to one student, but to hundreds of students, semester after semester. Valentino (2015) notes that donors like to support programs that have a cascading effect, that make a significant impact on an important issue, and that others have supported. If campus administration is reluctant to commit institutional funding, librarians can ask for assistance from donors seeking to fund a student success or completion initiative.</p> <h1><a id="enroll" data-url=""></a>“Our strategic plan is focused on enrollment and retention. What does OER have to do with those issues?”</h1> <p>If librarians find themselves in the position to advocate for OER support at the administrative level, connecting the goals and benefits of OER to institutional strategic planning can move those conversations forward. What does OER have to do with enrollment and retention, the two items that are likely high on any institutions’ list of strategic priorities? Research shows that OER may help with both. Fischer et al. (2015) find that students who took an OER course enrolled in a significantly higher number of credits the following semester. Although they acknowledge the difficulty in establishing causality between OER and enrollment intensity, the conclusions of this large scale study across fifteen different undergraduate courses at ten institutions suggests “enhanced probability” of a relationship. Colvard, Watson, and Park’s (2018) findings that Pell eligible students had dramatically reduced DFW rates in courses using <a class="glossaryLink" href="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/openstax/" aria-describedby="tt">OpenStax<div class="glossaryItemBody">OpenStax is a nonprofit educational initiative based at Rice University, and it's our mission to give every student the tools they need to be successful in the classroom.

Because we believe that a well-educated society profits us all. (openstax.org)</div>" data-url="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/openstax/"&gt;OpenStax</a> textbooks suggest that OER could be one among many high-impact practices that improve retention among more vulnerable populations. The body of research around OER is growing quickly; librarians advocating for OER can turn to resources like the Open Education Group (https://openedgroup.org/) for published research on OER impact that can be shared with administration and faculty.</p> <h1><a id="inclusiveaccess" data-url=""></a>“What about these inclusive access packages offered by the publishers? Aren’t they a sufficient way to save students money?”</h1> <p>The concept of inclusive access is appealing to many bookstores and universities across the nation. However, there are a few considerations beyond cost savings. The impingement on academic freedom is particularly troublesome because in order for students to really save money, faculty would have to agree to use textbooks from one particular publisher or vendor. If faculty truly have academic freedom to select the most appropriate course materials, then there is no guarantee that a student who pays for an inclusive access package will have access to all of their textbooks under that package. Additionally, e-textbooks through inclusive deals are really rentals because publishers typically only offer access for one semester or academic year for the quoted price. Bookstore rental plans currently in place have similarly restricted students’ ability to “own” the education they are paying for, but at least students often still had the choice to purchase used or older editions if they wanted a text they could write in or keep. With inclusive access plans, which are also moving in the direction of digital-first or digital-only (i.e., no print textbook included), student autonomy is further eroded by publishers. While OER are also digital-first, print options are typically more readily available and are far cheaper, while the digital versions are downloadable, are available in more accessible formats, and include permission to modify the content as needed to fit a student’s learning style. As Nicole Allen, Director of Open Education for <a class="glossaryLink" href="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/sparc/" aria-describedby="tt">SPARC<div class="glossaryItemBody"><span style="&quot;color:"><span style="&quot;font-family:"><span style="&quot;font-size:"><span style="&quot;font-family:"><img class="&quot;size-medium" src="denied:&quot;https://ijoer-org.layneplatform.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/sparc-logo-gray2-300x157.png&quot;" alt="&quot;logo" width="&quot;300&quot;" height="&quot;157&quot;" />SPARC (the Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition) works to enable the open sharing of research outputs and educational materials in order to democratize access to knowledge, accelerate discovery, and increase the return on our investment in research and education. As a catalyst for action, SPARC focuses on collaborating with other stakeholders—including authors, publishers, libraries, students, funders, policymakers and the public—to build on the opportunities created by the Internet, promoting changes to both infrastructure and culture needed to make open the default for research and education.</span></span></span></span><br />source:https://sparcopen.org/</div>" data-url="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/sparc/"&gt;SPARC</a>, states, inclusive access is “the opposite of inclusive, because it is premised on publishers controlling when, where and for how long students have access to their materials, and denying access unless they pay for it” <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/07/inclusive-access-takes-model-college-textbook-sales" data-url="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/11/07/inclusive-access-takes-model-college-textbook-sales">(McKenzie 2017)</a>. There is really no guarantee that anything offered on a publisher platform—notes or the text itself—will be available for future use by the student. The platform itself may cause technical difficulties for students and is likely designed in a way to lock down the content for only those uses prescribed by the vendor. In addition, as we as a society grow more and more concerned about online privacy, the selling and bartering of personal data, and the lack of transparency around what corporate entities are doing with our personal data, librarians in particular should be raising concerns with faculty and administration about students’ online privacy when an institution signs on for inclusive access. Although institutional contracts with publishers may state that data covered under FERPA is not collected, students are required to accept publisher terms of use and end-user license agreements that have been found to include language giving permission to collect, use, and share personal information (<a href="http://billymeinke.com/2018/03/26/signing-students-up-for-surveillance/" data-url="http://billymeinke.com/2018/03/26/signing-students-up-for-surveillance/">Meinke 2018)</a>. Librarians may be uniquely positioned on campus to raise these concerns with administration and educate on data collection and sharing practices that do not have students’ best interests at heart.</p> <h1><a id="bookstore" data-url=""></a>“Won’t the bookstore have a problem with this?”</h1> <p>With the rising use of online retailers, Amazon for example, bookstores have understood that their main revenue is from university apparel and other merchandising. <a href="https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=ideas-building-better-relationship-campus-bookstore-bell-tower" data-url="https://www.libraryjournal.com/?detailStory=ideas-building-better-relationship-campus-bookstore-bell-tower">Steven Bell (2018)</a> explains that “libraries and bookstores are not adversaries but share a common goal. Both want students to succeed academically.” He encourages librarians taking on OER initiatives on their campus to schedule a meeting with bookstore management and get an idea of their workflow in regards to cost savings for students. It is also pertinent that librarians educate the bookstore on the importance of OER, if they are not familiar with the concepts, and discuss with them strategies to facilitate the implementation of OER among various departments on campus. Creating a textbook affordability taskforce that includes representation from the bookstore will allow several constituents on campus space to discuss various steps or initiatives that can be taken to help students save money on textbooks. One way the bookstore can participate is to offer print copies of <a class="glossaryLink" href="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/creative-commons/" aria-describedby="tt">Creative Commons<div class="glossaryItemBody"><p><span class="&quot;ILfuVd"><span class="&quot;e24Kjd&quot;">A <b>Creative Commons</b> (CC) license is one of several public copyright licenses that enable the free distribution of an otherwise copyrighted &quot;work&quot;.</span></span> (wikipedia)</p> <p><img class="&quot;details-image&quot;" draggable="&quot;false&quot;" src="denied:&quot;https://www.ijoer.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Open_Content_A_Practical_Guide_to_Using_Creative_Commons_Licences_web-29-1024x1018.png&quot;" alt="&quot;&quot;" /></p></div>" data-url="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/creative-commons/"&gt;creative commons</a> licensed OER or open textbooks for students and faculty who still prefer print. The key to this relationship is communication with the bookstore throughout an OER initiative.</p> <h1><a id="faculty" data-url=""></a>“I’m just a librarian. Why would I talk to faculty about what textbook they use?”</h1> <p>Stop by the reserves desk during the first week of classes at any academic library that offers textbooks on reserve and it will be evident how many students do not own (or even rent) their course materials on the first or second day of class. At some academic libraries, the textbook reserve collection may be the most highly circulated collection. Librarians regularly hear from students how they struggle not just with the cost of their textbooks, but with the process of obtaining and using access codes for homework managers or with bookstores that do not have the correct edition in stock. As accessible student service providers, librarians often have firsthand knowledge and observation of students’ challenges with course materials and find themselves helping students troubleshoot or find work-arounds. Librarians also are aware of and maybe even witness the illegal downloading and printing of pirated textbooks on library computers in ways that faculty may be completely unaware of. Who is in a better position to bring these issues to faculty members’ attention? Liaison librarians in particular have likely already built relationships with departments and faculty that they can tap into for starting conversations about the reality of how students (fail to) access course materials. Librarians also have unique skills that are essential to finding and evaluating OER. Some OER repositories may be manageable for faculty to negotiate, like the <a class="glossaryLink" href="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/open-textbook/" aria-describedby="tt">Open Textbook<div class="glossaryItemBody">An <b>open textbook</b> is a textbook licensed under an open copyright license, and made available online to be freely used by students, teachers and members of the public. Many open textbooks are distributed in either print, e-book, or audio formats that may be downloaded or purchased at little or no cost. (wikipedia)</div>" data-url="https://www.ijoer.org/glossary/open-textbook/"&gt;Open Textbook</a> Library, which is intentionally designed to replicate the interface of textbook publisher websites. However, for subject areas where faculty may need to do more curation of resources than straight adoption of an open textbook, librarians’ ability to search, filter, refine, and evaluate results is unmatched. Beyond this, <a href="https://www.choice360.org/blog/librarians-oed-movement" data-url="https://www.choice360.org/blog/librarians-oed-movement">West (2016)</a> notes that the work librarians already do in the areas of instruction, outreach to faculty, service to the institution, and especially collection building is a natural fit for including OER. She states quite eloquently, “The all-encompassing work of supporting a useful, organized, relevant, timely, and healthy collection of materials that both stimulates scholarly inquiry and meets student information needs is an ongoing challenge for all libraries. That very challenge has made us uniquely talented at helping our colleagues make decisions about educational materials” (1439). If that is too much, the simple answer is: this is the kind of work that librarians do all the time, in preparing course reserves, selecting materials for collection development, teaching information literacy skills, and more.</p> <h1><a id="doall" data-url=""></a>“Are you expecting the librarians to do <em>all</em> of this?”</h1> <p>Simple answer: <em>of course not</em>. This answer might cause the conversation to circle back to the previous question, but the bottom line is that whether librarians are voluntarily taking on OER advocacy for student success and social justice reasons or they have been tasked with organizing an initiative because they have a track record of productive collaboration, a successful OER project or initiative will require participation from several individuals focusing on what they each do best. Working alongside librarians and faculty may be instructional designers, accessibility experts, technology services, and even students. Team approaches to OER selection, implementation, and assessment have proven to be not only the most efficient and successful, but also to be the most robust, innovative ,and sustainable. What lone advocate librarians may need to communicate to their colleagues is that while librarians should not be expected to do this work in a vacuum, all librarians at the institution—not just the “OER librarian,” scholarly communications librarian, or equivalent—could potentially contribute something valuable to a campus OER initiative. When advocating to fellow librarians, it is worthwhile to first seriously consider what those colleagues can bring to the table and then emphasize the unique value they will each add to the project when asking for their participation.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='753-1'>and others</div></div></div></div>

It says:</p> <blockquote><p>The final say about what resources will be used in a course usually lies with faculty, to whom students have unique, direct access. Some ways of doing this include:</p></blockquote> <ul><li><blockquote><p>Show faculty students care about this issue by sharing your thoughts on high textbook costs or showing them you appreciate it when they use cheap or free alternatives. One easy way to do this is through anonymous midterm or end of term course evaluations that take place at many institutions.</p></blockquote> </li> <li><blockquote><p>Tell faculty whom you think may be interested about open education. If you know of any examples of OER that would be useful in a course you have taken, tell the instructor about it. You can also refer them to resources or OER repositories (see below), or share stories of other faculty adopting OER at your institution.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="407-1"></span></span></p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Below is a sample script from the <em>Textbook Affordability Toolkit</em> that can be used when talking to an instructor about open textbooks.</p> <blockquote><h2>Sample talking points for meeting with a faculty member</h2> <p><strong>Intro</strong>: Hi, Professor. I’m [Name] from [Student Group]. Thank you for letting me come talk to you about our campaign to make textbooks affordable.</p> <p><strong>Introduce the problem</strong>: Textbook costs are a big issue for students here on campus. Textbooks are expensive—$1200 per student per year for books and supplies, and prices have been rising at three times the rate of inflation. Students are even opting not to buy the books—65 percent of students surveyed reported not buying or renting a required book because of the price. [If relevant, tell a brief personal story about how textbook costs have affected you.]</p> <p><strong>Ask</strong>: Is this a problem that’s come to your attention before?</p> <p><strong>Introduce the solution</strong>: The good news is that affordable alternatives exist that can save students a lot of money. Open textbooks are books that are published under an open licence that allows them to be used and shared for free.</p> <p><strong>Open textbooks are comparable to traditional textbooks</strong>: They are written and reviewed by experts and cover the standard material for a course. Open textbooks have benefits that make them preferable to traditional textbooks because instructors can adapt the text by adding their own content or problem sets or removing unwanted material.</p> <p><strong>Ask</strong>: Have you come across open textbooks before?</p> <p><strong>Call to action</strong>: Open textbooks are a great solution, but the challenge is that not enough professors have the support they need to use them. I wanted to discuss a couple ways you might be able to help.</p> <p><strong>Sample ask</strong>: Would you be willing to talk with a librarian about using open textbooks in your classes?</p> <p><strong>Sample ask</strong>: Would you be willing to share information about open textbooks with your colleagues?</p> <p><strong>Sample ask</strong>: Would you be willing to support our campaign to expand the use of open textbooks?</p> <p><strong>Closing</strong>: Thank you for agreeing to [Action].
