The amount of water in the tank is defined as 1 volt, and the “narrowness” (resistance to flow) of the hose is defined as 1 ohm. Using Ohm’s law, this gives us a flow (current) of 1 amp.</p> <p>Using this analogy, let’s now look at the tank with the narrow hose. Because the hose is narrower, its resistance to flow is higher. Let’s define this resistance as 2 ohms. The amount of water in the tank is the same as the other tank, so, using Ohm’s law, our equation for the tank with the narrow hose is:</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca:3000/latex?latex=%3F%3D%5Cfrac%7B1V%7D%7B2%5Ctext%7B%20ohms%7D%7D&amp;fg=000000&amp;font=TeX&amp;svg=1" alt="?=\frac{1V}{2\text{ ohms}}" title="?=\frac{1V}{2\text{ ohms}}" class="latex mathjax" /></p> <p>But what is the current?

Imagine that you are at home, heating something in the microwave (perhaps a burrito) when all of a sudden all of the lights go out. But not just the lights, the microwave and every electrical device not powered by a battery is dead.</p> <p>Perhaps a tree has fallen across some power lines? Regardless of the cause, the effect is the same: the power is out. This is a common and annoying experience for us all, and often there is nothing to do but light some candles, read a book, and wait.</p> <p>How do we know when the power has been restored? All of a sudden all the lights come back on, and there’s a beep from the microwave letting you know that the clock needs to be reset.</p> <p>The lights are an example of low-voltage release (LVR). The <span class="glossary-term">switches</span> that control the lights were closed when the power went out, stayed closed during the power outage (the period of “low voltage”), and when the power was restored, the switches were all still in their “ON” position. The load was “released” after the period of “low-voltage.”</p> <p>Low-voltage release (LVR) is very useful for circuits where re-energization after a brief or temporary loss of power is safe and desirable. Some examples include lighting circuits, sump pumps, refrigeration circuits, and ventilation circuits. These are examples of circuits where their failure to re-energize after a power disruption could lead to damage of property (sump pump) or endangerment of safety (parkade ventilation).</p> <p>The microwave was an example of low-voltage protection (LVP). The timer controlling the microwave shut off when the power went out, and when the power returned, the <span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span> of the microwave waited for further input from a human operator.</p> <p>Low-voltage protection (LVP) is desirable when the sudden activation of a machine or other electrical load could cause damage or injury. Some examples would include any rotating machinery (table-saws, lathes) or moving conveyor belts. These are examples of circuits where the sudden re-energization could surprise or injure a person working nearby.</p> <p>There are many ways that circuits can be equipped with either low-voltage release (LVR) or low-voltage protection (LVP), but two of the simplest are with <span class="glossary-term">two-wire</span> and <span class="glossary-term">three-wire circuits</span> respectively.</p> <p>As a rule, if a circuit uses a magnetic contactor and a holding contact, it will provide low-voltage protection (LVP).</p> <p>If it uses maintained contacts, then it most likely provides low-voltage release (LVR).</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://streaming.video.ubc.ca/p/122/sp/12200/thumbnail/entry_id/0_wpx9vux0/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;LVR vs LVP&amp;quot;" title="LVR vs LVP" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

As such the motor starts to draw very high values of <span class="glossary-term">current</span>. This current creates a magnetic field that causes the motor shaft to spin, and that spinning action creates a counter-EMF (CEMF), which limits the current to its normal running value.</p> <p>The initial high value of current is called <span class="glossary-term">inrush</span> and can cause severe line disturbances and nuisance tripping if <span class="glossary-term">fuses</span> and <span class="glossary-term">circuit breakers</span> are not sized accordingly.</p> <h1>Overload</h1> <p>The term “<span class="glossary-term">overload</span>” describes a moderate and gradual rise in the value of current over a relatively long period of time. It is caused by excessive amounts of current drawn by a motor, which may be as high as six times the rated current. This is caused by too much load on a motor. Systems are protected by <span class="glossary-term">overload protection relays</span>. While overloads are allowed for a short time (usually minutes), prolonged overloads will use thermal action to cause a protective device to trip.</p> <h1>Overcurrent</h1> <p>The term “<span class="glossary-term">overcurrent</span>” (sometimes called a short circuit or a ground fault) describes a sharp and fast rise in current over a short period of time (fractions of a second). Circuits and equipment are protected from overcurrent situations by fuses or circuit breakers.</p> <p>In these cases, the value of current is far greater than the nominal line current and can indeed be anywhere from six times to many hundreds of times greater the normal rated current value of current.</p> <p>There are several causes of overcurrent situations. For example, when a bolted fault occurs—either a line to ground or a line to line fault. This causes a very large value of current to be drawn because of the inversely proportional relationship between the <span class="glossary-term">resistance</span> of a circuit and the current drawn.</p> <p>Another less intuitive cause of short circuits is when an induction motor starts. When a three-phase induction motor is first energized, the stator windings consist of a very low resistance path. This draws a very large inrush current which is indistinguishable from a standard short circuit, except that it quickly drops down to the rated value of current drawn by the motor. This is due to the CEMF (counter-electromotive force) developed by the rotating shaft of the motor. When the motor is spinning, a CEMF limits the current to safe values. When the motor is not spinning, a very large value of current is drawn from the source. This current is sometimes called <span class="glossary-term">locked-rotor current</span>, and <span class="glossary-term">motor starters</span> and overcurrent devices must be rated to safely handle this value of current.</p> <h2>Effects of short circuits</h2> <p>Two of the main negative outputs of overcurrents are:</p> <ul><li><strong>Thermal energy</strong>: High values of current will create lots of heat, which can damage equipment and wires. Thermal energy can be expressed by I<sup>2</sup>t (current squared times time)—the longer the fault persists, the greater the potential thermal damage.</li> <li><strong>Mechanical forces</strong>: High-fault currents can create powerful magnetic fields and exert huge magnetic stress on busbars and equipment, sometimes warping them out of shape and creating other problems.</li> </ul> <p>Large values of fault current can cause damage very quickly, so overcurrent protective devices must act very quickly to clear the fault. There are two main categories of overcurrent protective devices: fuses and circuit breakers.</p> <h2>Fuses</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_26" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26" style="width: 263px"><img class="wp-image-26" src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-859x1024.jpg" alt="" width="263" height="314" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-859x1024.jpg 859w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-252x300.jpg 252w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-768x915.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-1289x1536.jpg 1289w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-1719x2048.jpg 1719w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-65x77.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-225x268.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609-350x417.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/IMG_2567-scaled-e1580158450609.jpg 1907w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-26">Fuses</div></div> <p>A <span class="glossary-term">fuse</span> is a simple device that protects the conductors and equipment of a circuit from damage due to higher than normal fault values. It is designed to be the weakest link in a circuit.</p> <p>A fuse is an insulated tube containing a strip of conductive metal (fuse-link) that has a lower melting point than either copper or aluminum. The fuse link has narrow, resistive segments that concentrate the current and cause the temperature at those points to rise.</p> <p>In a short circuit, the fuse elements burn open in just a fraction of a second. The higher the values of fault current, the faster the fuse will react.</p> <p>In an overload situation, the fuse elements can take many seconds or even minutes before thermal actions cause the fuse link to melt open.</p> <p>Fuses come in two categories: Fast-acting fuse (Type P) and time-delay fuse (Type D).</p> <p>Fuses used in motor circuits have to withstand the intense inrush current when the motor is started, and so we use time-delay fuses, also known as “dual-element fuses.”</p> <h2>Common ratings</h2> <p>All overcurrent devices must be operated within their rated values. Three of the most important ratings are voltage, current, and interrupting capacity.</p> <h3>Voltage rating</h3> <p>Fuses and circuit breakers must be rated for at least the value of the <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span> of the circuit they are designed to protect.</p> <p>When a fuse or circuit breaker interrupts a fault current, it must safely extinguish the arc and prevent it from reestablishing itself. Therefore, the <span class="glossary-term">voltage rating</span> of a fuse or circuit breaker must be equal to or greater than the system voltage.</p> <p>For example, a fuse rated at 240V RMS will be acceptable for use in a 120V circuit. However, it would exceed the fuse’s voltage rating to use it in a 600V circuit.</p> <h3>Continuous-duty rating</h3> <p><span class="glossary-term">Continuous-duty rating</span> describes the maximum rated value of RMS current that the overcurrent device is designed to handle on a continuous basis without tripping. Generally speaking, the <span class="glossary-term">ampere</span> rating of the fuse or breaker should not exceed the current carrying capacity of the circuit, but there are exceptions, such as certain motor circuits.</p> <h3>Interrupting capacity</h3> <p>When a short circuit or ground fault occurs, the circuit resistance drops to effectively zero <span class="glossary-term">ohms</span>, causing very large values of current to flow. This extremely fast rise in fault current can cause damage to wires and equipment through overheating and must be extinguished as quickly as possible.</p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">interrupting-capacity (IC) rating</span> of an overcurrent device is the maximum fault current that the device can interrupt without damage to itself. Most circuit breakers and fuses have an IC rating of 10,000 amps.</p> <p>For systems capable of larger fault currents, high-rupture capacity (HRC) fuses can interrupt currents up to 200,000 amps by using an arc-quenching filler such as silica sand to help interrupt the fault.</p> </div></div>

The second category is to automatically control the switch via some sort of <span class="glossary-term">process variable</span>.</p> <p>Many processes require automatic switching, independent of human operators for safety, accuracy, and efficiency. For instance, motors are often controlled by what are known as <span class="glossary-term">pilot devices</span> that sense external conditions and provide two-wire control.</p> <p>There are nearly limitless process variables which can be monitored by pilot devices, such as liquid level, proximity, temperature, and pressure.</p> <p>All pilot devices share the same two-step process:</p> <ol><li>Sense external input.</li> <li>Change the state of electrical contacts.</li> </ol> <p>This text will focus mainly on the second of these two stages, as the connection of electrical contacts into our <span class="glossary-term">control circuits</span> is where we will see the most utility for our pilot devices. Indeed an entire textbook could be written about the many types and configurations of various pilot devices, but this is beyond the scope of this book. Instead, we will examine simple control devices that respond to the condition of a process variable such as temperature, pressure, liquid level, flow, position or proximity by activating a set of contacts.</p> <h1>Float Switches</h1> <p>Float switches, also known as liquid-level switches, are pilot devices used primarily in pump-motor applications to respond to changes in liquid level. There are many different types of float switches, but the simplest mechanical arrangement is a pivoted arm that has the electrical contacts fastened at one end and a rod connected to a float at the other. As the water level rises or falls, the float moves with the water level and the contacts change their state accordingly.</p> <p>For typical tank-filling services, float switches close their electrical contacts at a low-liquid level and open at a high level, while for sump pump purposes, the float switch closes the circuit at a high-liquid level and opens the circuit at a low-liquid level.</p> <p><img class="size-large wp-image-47 aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-1024x161.png" alt="" width="1024" height="161" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-1024x161.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-300x47.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-768x121.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-1536x242.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-2048x323.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-65x10.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-225x35.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Float-Switch-e1579563428479-350x55.png 350w" title="" /></p> <h1>Temperature Switches</h1> <p>Temperature switches are used to provide automatic control in heating and cooling systems. Simple thermostats often use a coiled bimetallic element to activate a switch contact. This is sufficient for the simple heating and cooling of rooms.</p> <p>For industrial processes that require monitoring of material temperature, a remote-bulb temperature switch is often used. The bulb is placed inside the medium to be measured and is linked via a capillary tube to a bellows. As the temperature of the fluid in the bulb rises, its volume expands and causes an internal pressure change. This change in pressure results in the movement of the bellows, activating a set of switch contacts.</p> <p><img class="size-large wp-image-48" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-1024x171.png" alt="" width="1024" height="171" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-1024x171.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-300x50.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-768x129.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-1536x257.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-2048x343.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-65x11.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-225x38.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Temperature-Switch-e1579563531594-350x59.png 350w" title="" /></p> <h1>Pressure Switches</h1> <p>A pressure switch is a device that is used to sense a rise or fall in pressure and is usually pipe-connected to the vessel containing the medium (such as water, steam, air, or gas) that operates the switch. Pressure switches are commonly used as safety devices to protect system equipment from either dangerously high pressure or low pressure.</p> <p>When dealing with pressure controls, the term “cut in” refers to the pressure of the system when the switch closes, and this normally applies to decreasing pressure. The term&nbsp;“cut out” refers to the pressure of the system when the switch opens and normally applies to increasing pressure.</p> <p>While the range of a pressure switch describes the overall pressure over which the switch can operate, the sensitivity of its contacts can usually be adjusted and the differential describes the difference between the cut-in and the cut-out pressure of the switch.</p> <p><img class="size-large wp-image-49" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-1024x162.png" alt="" width="1024" height="162" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-1024x162.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-300x47.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-768x122.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-1536x243.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-2048x324.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-65x10.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-225x36.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Pressure-Switch-e1579563586979-350x55.png 350w" title="" /></p> <h1>Flow Switches</h1> <p>A flow switch is activated by the movement of either liquid or air through a pipe or duct.

The operation of a limit switch relies on an external force striking an operating arm or lever, which in turn activates a set of control contacts. Once the force is removed, the operating arm returns to its normal position and the contacts reset.</p> <p>Special types of limit switches can provide a maintained-contact action, whereby the contacts remain in their changed position even after the initial force is removed from the activation arm. These types of limit switches need to be reset between uses, usually by simply moving the operating mechanism in the opposite direction.</p> <p>Limit switch contacts are frequently used in applications where <span class="glossary-term">normally open contacts</span> are mechanically held closed, or <span class="glossary-term">normally closed contacts</span> are mechanically held open. Control schematics usually display symbols to indicate the state of the switch contacts when the system is in the “off” condition. For example, the symbol for a “normally open held closed” limit switch indicates that the contacts have been wired normally open, but when the circuit is put into its normal off state, part of the machine keeps the contact held closed.</p> <p>Other types of pilot devices, such as those used in pressure and flow switches, can be configured in a similar way, but it is seen most often with mechanical-limit switches.</p> <p><img class="size-large wp-image-51" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-1024x233.png" alt="" width="1024" height="233" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-1024x233.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-300x68.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-768x175.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-1536x349.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-2048x466.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-65x15.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-225x51.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Limit-Switch-e1579564114399-350x80.png 350w" title="" /></p> <h1>Proximity Switches</h1> <p>A proximity switch is a type of limit switch that does not require physical contact in order to function but rather senses the presence of particular materials. There are three main styles of proximity switches, each relying on different physical phenomenon to operate.</p> <h2>Inductive-proximity switch</h2> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-52" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon-240x300.png" alt="" width="150" height="188" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon-240x300.png 240w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon-65x81.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon-225x281.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon-350x438.png 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Car-And-Traffic-Light-Icon.png 400w" title="" />Inductive proximity switches detect the presence of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals (ferrous refers to materials containing iron). They rely on the creation and monitoring of an electromagnetic field. An example is traffic sensors embedded into the pavement that sense the presence of the metallic body of the car and control the signal action of the traffic lights.</p> <h2>Capacitive-proximity switch</h2> <p>Capacitive-proximity switches detect the presence of almost any material. They rely on the creation and detection of an electrostatic field. Examples include the interactive touch screen of almost every modern electronic device, including smart phones and tablets.</p> <p>Both inductive and capacitive types of proximity sensors use an oscillator circuit to generate a sensing field and series of solid-state devices to sense any change in the field, which in turn activates a set of external contacts.</p> <h2>Photoelectric switch</h2> <p>Photoelectric switches are proximity switches which emit and detect a beam of light from an infrared LED. If the beam is interrupted or interfered with, this is sensed by the receiver and a signal is sent to another series of solid-state devices, which in turn then operate a set of contacts. Examples include the sensors on automatic doors, including elevator doors, as well as touchless faucets that activate whenever a person places their hands in the sink to be washed.</p> </div></div>

Regardless of its design, all motor starters must be used within their <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span> and <span class="glossary-term">power</span> ratings and must provide overload protection. One of the ways that motor starters provide overload protection is through the use of overload relays (OLR).</p> <h1>Common Ratings</h1> <p>There are three significant electrical ratings for motor starters: voltage, horsepower, and ampacity (current value).</p> <p>The voltage rating of a motor starter must be rated for at least the operating voltage of the motor that it controls. This rating is specified on the motor and starter nameplates.</p> <p>The ampacity rating of a starter usually refers to the overload protection device. The selection of the proper overload heater depends on the FLA (full-load-amps) current drawn by the motor. FLA is usually specified on the motor’s nameplate and most manufacturers supply a table for heater-size selection.</p> <p>Ambient temperature can also have an effect on overload heater sensitivity. Precautions should be taken when operating motor starters in very high or low ambient temperature environments.</p> <p>The horsepower rating of a starter must meet or exceed the horsepower rating of the motor it controls at its listed operating voltage.</p> <p>Horsepower is always given at a specified voltage. For example, a starter rated 3 horsepower at 240 V must not be used to control a 3 horsepower, 120 V. Instead it would most likely be rated for only 1.5 horsepower at 120 V.</p> </div></div>

Most toggle-switch starters are rated at maximum 1 horsepower at 230V. They may be for single-pole or double-pole switching, and the ON and OFF positions are clearly marked on the lever.</p> <p>The switch is similar in appearance to a standard light switch, but the main difference is that the <span class="glossary-term">motor starter</span> has <span class="glossary-term">horsepower-rated contacts</span>, which means that it can safely make and break the current drawn by the motor.</p> <p>It also contains a thermal-overload device to provide overload protection by sensing any higher-than normal currents drawn by the motor. If a motor <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> occurs, the excess current drawn by the motor causes the heater element to heat up, which automatically trips the switch contacts and breaks the circuit. The handle moves to the middle or tripped position, and after a cooling period, the toggle switch can be reset by pushing the lever into the fully off position and then switching it on again.</p> <p>The compact construction of this manual-starter switch allows it to be installed directly on driven machinery and in tight spaces.</p> <h1>Pushbutton</h1> <p>Pushbutton motor starters are used for single-phase motors that are typically rated at a maximum 5 horsepower at 230V. They are similar in operating principle to toggle switches, except that they use two separate buttons to activate contacts. To start the motor, depress the start button so that it moves inward. A <span class="glossary-term">mechanical interlocking device</span> forces the stop button outward. Once activated, these buttons remain in position until the opposite button is pressed.</p> <p>If an overload occurs, the contacts can be reset by pushing firmly on the stop button after allowing for a cooling period.</p> <h1>Drum Switch</h1> <p>The drum switch is a rotary-action selector switch that is commonly used to manually control speed and to change the directions of motors. The handle in the centre at the top can be moved radially to various positions, turning a central shaft. The moving contacts on the shaft connect to a series of contacts on the perimeter of the drum.</p> <p>When used to control single-phase motors, they are typically rated up to 3 horsepower at 240V or 1.5 horsepower at 120V.</p> <p>The drum switch does not provide overload protection. Additional overload protection must be installed when using drum switches.</p> <p>All manual starters have maintained contacts. If the power fails while the contacts are closed, when power is restored, the load will automatically re-energize. As a general rule, manual starters provide two-wire control and <span class="glossary-term">low-voltage release (LVR)</span>.</p> </div></div>

When an electric current is passed through the coil of wire, a magnetic field is created. This field, in turn, draws the armature towards it, causing the movable contacts to bridge the gap of the stationary contacts and thus energizing the motor. A spring is constantly trying to open the contacts but as long as there is a <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span> present at the coil, magnetic forces will overcome the strength of this spring.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-72" src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized.png" alt="" width="500" height="373" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized.png 3934w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-300x224.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-1024x764.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-768x573.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-1536x1146.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-2048x1527.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-65x48.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-225x168.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-De-Energized-350x261.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72">Contactor coil de-energized</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 356px"><img class="" src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Relay-Energized.png" alt="" width="356" height="265" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Contactor coil energized</div></div> <p>When there is a power outage, however, and the current through the coil drops below a threshold, the spring will push open the contacts. If power is restored, the motor load will not re-energize but will instead require further input from the operator. This type of control is called three-wire control and it provides low-voltage protection (LVP).</p> <p>For the control of three-phase motors, contactors are built with three sets of <span class="glossary-term">horsepower-rated contacts</span>. Additional <span class="glossary-term">auxiliary contacts</span> can be included as well. Relay contacts are usually silver-plated to improve their conductivity and although single-break contacts are used, most industrial quality relays use double-break contacts to improve their interrupting capability.</p> <p>Coils are generally designed to activate at approximately 85% of their rated voltage and will not deactivate until the voltage falls below approximately 85% of the rated value. Usually a coil can withstand an overvoltage of up to 10% without damage to the coil.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><strong>Question:</strong> If magnetic coils are power by AC, why don’t their contacts open and close 120 times per second?</p> <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Sometimes they do! If a magnetic contactor is making an unnatural “chattering” sound, it may be caused by a loose or faulty shading coil. Shading coils are simple closed loops of conductive material that, when exposed to the changing magnetic field of an AC circuit, creates its own magnetic field with a slight delay in period. This allows for a constant magnetic attraction between the moveable armature and the coil of the contactor. If a contactor is “chattering,” it may need its shading coils repaired or replaced.</p> </div> <p>The overload relay (OLR) is similar in design to that used in manual motor starters. The key difference is that the <span class="glossary-term">normally closed contacts</span> of the OLR are wired in series with the current that flows through the armature of the contactor coil. This ensures that if an <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> occurs in any of the three power lines supplying the motor, the normally closed contacts of the OLR will open, and the contactor supplying power to the motor is disconnected from the circuit.</p> <p>The key utility comes in separating the control circuit from the power circuit.

These leads are numbered 1–9, and in both Wye and Delta follow a standard numbering convention: starting at the top of the diagram with wire number 1, draw an inwardly descending spiral from each connection point, ascending to the next number at each step.</p> <p>Depending upon the internal construction of the motor, these leads can be hooked up in one of four ways: High- or low-voltage Wye, or high- or low-voltage Delta</p> <h1>Identifying Wye or Delta with an Ohmmeter</h1> <p>It sometimes becomes necessary to test or confirm the configuration of a motor before final connection. If a Wye wound motor is connected as a Delta wound motor or vice versa, the motor will not operate properly.</p> <p>Consider this situation: You have nine leads coming from a motor, but no indication of whether its Wye or Delta wound. By using an <span class="glossary-term">ohmmeter</span> to do a simple continuity check, you can determine the construction type of the motor.</p> <p>If it is Wye wound, each of wires 1, 2, and 3 should only have continuity with one other lead (4, 5 and 6 respectively). The three leads without continuity to wires 1, 2, and 3 should all have continuity with each other.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-116" style="width: 1024px"><img class="wp-image-111 size-large" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-1024x637.png" alt="" width="1024" height="637" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-1024x637.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-300x187.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-768x478.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-1536x956.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-2048x1274.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-65x40.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-225x140.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Wye-Motor-Connection-e1579634366548-350x218.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Wye motor connections</div></div> <p>If it is Delta wound, each of wires 1, 2, and 3 should have continuity with two other leads:</p> <ul><li>T1 has continuity to T4 &amp;T9</li> <li>T2 has continuity to T5 &amp;T7</li> <li>T3 has continuity to T6 &amp;T8</li> </ul> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_400" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-400" style="width: 807px"><img class="wp-image-400" src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3.png" alt="" width="807" height="476" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3.png 688w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3-300x177.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3-65x38.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3-225x133.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Delta-motor-connections_2-3-350x207.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-400">Delta Motor Connections</div></div> <p>It is important to note that these points represent the internal connection of the coils of the motor, not how they are to be hooked up to voltage.</p> <h1>Wye Connections</h1> <h2>Low-voltage Wye</h2> <p>In this configuration, each phase is brought to two coils that are connected in parallel with each other.

The start and stop action of the motor is determined by the <span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span>, which energizes the magnetic motor starter, pulling in or dropping out the <span class="glossary-term">armature</span> that then opens or closes the power contacts.</p> <p>The current that goes to the motor then runs through the heater elements of the <span class="glossary-term">overload relay</span>. If the motor draws too high a current for too long, the heater element causes a <span class="glossary-term">normally closed contact</span> to open, which then interrupts the current to the motor starters coil.&nbsp; This causes the power contacts to automatically open and turn off the motor.</p> <p>This relationship also provides <span class="glossary-term">low-voltage protection (LVP)</span> in the case of a power outage. Motors controlled from magnetic starters need to be manually reset following a period of low <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span>.</p> <p>The motor starters that we will be focusing on are “across-the-line” magnetic motor starters. This refers to them using full-line voltage to start the motor.</p> <p>Across-the-line motor starters draw large <span class="glossary-term">inrush currents</span> when energized. To minimize inrush currents and severe starting torques, some circuits use a variety of “soft-start” devices, but these devices are beyond the scope of this text.</p> <p>Power circuits are identical for most 3-phase motor starters, so it is common not to refer to them in <span class="glossary-term">schematic drawings</span>.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-control-circuits" title="Control Circuit’s Source of Supply"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">27</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Control Circuit’s Source of Supply</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Compared to the <span class="glossary-term">power circuit</span>, the <span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span> is where things get interesting.</p> <p>Control circuits can be simple two-wire on/off devices that energize a <span class="glossary-term">motor starter</span>, or they can be more involved <span class="glossary-term">three-wire circuits</span> with multiple <span class="glossary-term">pushbutton</span> locations and motors that start in sequence.</p> <p>One of the key advantages of control circuits is that they can operate at a lower <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span> than the motor that they control. This allows an operator to push a 120V pushbutton, which then energizes a 120V starter coil whose <span class="glossary-term">contacts</span> then close on a 600V motor. If a dangerous fault occurs, the high-voltage switching happens in a location away from the operator.</p> <p>Since the value of voltage between conductors in a 3-phase system could be as high as 600V and the control circuit is usually a single-phase 120V AC circuit, some form of control-circuit voltage must be available. Power for the control circuit can be supplied in one of three different ways.</p> <h1>A Separate Source</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 243px"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Control-Power-2-e1579638316286.png" alt="" width="243" height="352" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Control Power Separate Source</div></div> <p>This system can provide a lower voltage for the control circuit, but requires additional wires and breakers to be installed at the main-load centre to supply the control circuit.</p> <h1>Direct from the Line</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" style="width: 246px"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/08/Control-Power-1-e1579638399592.png" alt="" width="246" height="342" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Control Power Direct from the Line</div></div> <p>This system does not allow the control circuit to operate at a lower voltage than the power circuit.

Control relays behave just like motor starters but lack overload protection and power contacts. Control relays are loads that must be connected in <span class="glossary-term">parallel</span> with the motor starter to ensure they get their rated <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span>.</p> <p>In any <span class="glossary-term">schematic diagram</span>, the current must find its way from Line 1 to Line 2 and energize only one load along the way. Switches offer either infinite <span class="glossary-term">resistance</span> when they are open or zero resistance when they are closed, so some device must limit the current to prevent short circuits. Notice that the current that passes through the control relay does not pass through the motor starter. This means that they will both get their rated value of voltage and pull in their armatures.</p> <p>As a rule, we NEVER connect loads in series.</p> <p>Under normal conditions, if the start button is pressed, current will be able to complete the circuit and energize the control relay. Once the relay is energized, the two normally open contacts associated with it will change their state and close. This will provide a path for current to energize the motor starter, closing the 2-3 holding contacts and running the motor.</p> <p>The circuit will continue to operate as a standard three-wire circuit providing <span class="glossary-term">low-voltage protection (LVP)</span>&nbsp;until either the stop button is pressed, or an <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> occurs.</p> <p>If the jog button is pressed while the motor is running, there will be no change to the circuit.</p> <p>If, however, the jog button is pressed while the motor is not running, it will provide a path for current to energize the motor starter. The current will not be able to energize the control relay, and so once the jog button is released, the starter drops out and the motor comes to a stop.</p> <ul><li>The advantage of this circuit lies in its safety and reliability. Having two separate buttons for “run” and “jog” functions increases ease of control for the operator.</li> <li>The disadvantage is the additional cost and installation time associated with the control relay and additional current drawn in the <span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span> due to the second coil.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://streaming.video.ubc.ca/p/122/sp/12200/thumbnail/entry_id/0_zbosni9z/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Jog with Control Relay&amp;quot;" title="Jog with Control Relay" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The return paths for both starter coils connect in <span class="glossary-term">series</span> with the <span class="glossary-term">normally closed contacts</span> of the <span class="glossary-term">overload relay</span> so that if an overload occurs in either direction, the starter coils will be de-energized and the motor will come to a stop.</p> <p>Note that the two contactors must be <span class="glossary-term">electrically</span> and <span class="glossary-term">mechanically interlocked</span> so that they cannot be energized simultaneously. If both starter coils became energized simultaneously, a short circuit will occur with potentially hazardous results.</p> <p>Forward / reverse starters will come with two sets of normally open <span class="glossary-term">auxiliary contacts</span> to act as holding contacts in each direction. They will also come with two sets of normally closed auxiliary contacts to act as electrical interlocks.</p> <h1>Mechanical Interlocks</h1> <p>Forward / reverse starters must never close their power contacts simultaneously. The best way to provide this is through electrical interlocks, which prevent the one coil from being energized if the other is engaged. A failure in electrical interlocking can cause both coils to be energized at the same time.</p> <p>If both become energized, some form of mechanical interlock is required to prevent both <span class="glossary-term">armatures</span> from pulling in. Represented on <span class="glossary-term">schematic diagrams</span> as a dotted line between the two coils, a mechanical interlock is a physical barrier that is pushed into the path of one coil’s armature by the movement of the adjacent coil. This means that even if both coils are energized, only one armature will be able to pull in fully. The coil that is prevented from pulling in will make a terrible chattering sound as it tries to complete the magnetic circuit.</p> <p>Mechanical interlocks should be relied on as a last resort for protection.</p> <h1>Electrical Interlocks</h1> <p>Electrical interlocking is accomplished by installing the normally closed contact of one direction’s coil in series with the opposite direction’s coil, and vice versa. This ensures that when the forward coil is energized, pushing the reverse <span class="glossary-term">pushbutton</span> will not energize the reverse coil. The same situation is in effect when the reverse coil is energized. In both situations the stop button will need to be pressed to de-energize the running coil and return all its auxiliary contacts back to their original state. Then the opposite direction coil can be engaged.</p> <h1>Reversing Control Circuit</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158" style="width: 1024px"><img class="size-large wp-image-157" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-1024x407.png" alt="" width="1024" height="407" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-1024x407.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-300x119.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-768x305.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-1536x610.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-2048x814.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-65x26.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-225x89.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Forward-Reverse-e1579710068660-350x139.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Forward/Reverse control circuit</div></div> <p>When designing the control schematic for forward / reverse circuits, we start with the standard <span class="glossary-term">three-wire circuit</span>, add a second normally open pushbutton, and add a holding contact branch for the second coil.

To provide <span class="glossary-term">plugging</span> action, the zero-speed switch must be wired <span class="glossary-term">normally open</span> so that any motion of the motor shaft will cause the <span class="glossary-term">contacts</span> to change their state and close.</p> <p>To <strong>plug</strong> a motor to a stop, the circuit momentarily reverses the motor while it is rotating in the forward direction, but then de-energizes it before it can build up any momentum in the reverse direction.</p> <p>Under normal operating conditions, the motor is started in the forward direction by pressing the start button. This energizes the forward coil and closes the normally open <span class="glossary-term">2-3 holding contact</span> in <span class="glossary-term">parallel</span> with the start button as well as opening the normally open <span class="glossary-term">electrical interlocks</span> in <span class="glossary-term">series</span> with the reverse coil.</p> <p>The motor will continue to run and the circuit will operate as a standard <span class="glossary-term">three-wire circuit</span> providing <span class="glossary-term">low-voltage protection (LVP)</span> until either the stop button is pressed, or an <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> occurs.</p> <p>While the shaft of the motor is spinning, the contacts of the zero-speed switch will change their state, and the forward contact will close. This contact is wired in series with the reverse coil, but cannot energize it so long as the electrical interlock remains open.</p> <p>When the stop button is pushed, the forward coil is de-energized, dropping out its <span class="glossary-term">armature</span>. This causes all the contacts associated with that coil to return to their normal condition, including the normally closed electrical interlock.</p> <p>Since the shaft of the motor is still spinning in the forward direction due to inertia, the normally open zero-speed switch contacts are being held closed. This means that the instant the stop button is pressed, the reverse coil gets energized, momentarily sending the motor in the reverse direction and cancelling out all of its forward momentum, thus bringing the motor to a halt much quicker.</p> <p>The instant that the shaft of the motor begins to move in the reverse direction, the held-closed forward contacts of the zero-speed switch open and the reverse coil is de-energized before the motor can build up any momentum in the reverse direction.</p> <p>The motor has now been plugged to stop.

Nothing however prevents the motor from being sent in the forward direction again, as the timed contacts for TD2 remain closed.</p> <p>If the motor is sent in the reverse direction, then stopped, TD2 will ensure that the operator must wait ten seconds before the motor can be sent in the forward direction.</p> <p>Under normal operation, this circuit will provide <span class="glossary-term">low-voltage protection (LVP)</span>, and the motor will run in either direction until either the stop button is pressed, or an <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> occurs.</p> </div></div>

Troubleshooting motors and the mechanical systems they drive is an extensive topic beyond the scope of this text.</p> <p>A motor may not start for a variety of reasons. Knowing what to check for and where to begin is a valuable skill that can reduce downtime when a fault occurs.</p> <p>Usually, there are two fundamental steps in troubleshooting. The first is a cursory visual inspection, followed by a more in-depth examination with testing equipment and referencing several diagrams</p> <p>Motor control circuits have several protective devices built into them to protect wires and equipment. It is always a good idea to start your visual inspection by checking overload and overcurrent devices. A visual inspection sometimes quickly locates a fault or identifies situations requiring maintenance. For example, you might see a tripped indicator on a <span class="glossary-term">circuit breaker</span>, <span class="glossary-term">switch</span> or <span class="glossary-term">overload relay</span>. Resetting the device might be all the circuit needs to resume working.</p> <p>If an <span class="glossary-term">overload</span> or <span class="glossary-term">overcurrent</span> situation has occurred, it is advisable to find the source of this fault. A visual inspection can identify burnt or heat-discoloured components, loose wires in terminal blocks, or mechanical parts that bind together or cause excessive friction.</p> <p>When there is no obvious cause for the problem(s), it is often necessary to analyze <span class="glossary-term">circuit diagrams</span> and take measurements of <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span> and <span class="glossary-term">resistance</span> at key points of the circuit. To do this, we use <span class="glossary-term">voltmeters</span> and <span class="glossary-term">ohmmeters</span>. A firm understanding of their use and limitations is necessary for their safe operation in circuits.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-meters" title="Using Meters for Troubleshooting"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">45</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Using Meters for Troubleshooting</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h1>Voltmeter</h1> <p>A <span class="glossary-term">voltmeter</span> is designed to be used on a live circuit. When working on live circuits, all safety precautions and PPE (personal protective equipment) requirements should be adhered to.</p> <p>A voltmeter is essentially a very high value of <span class="glossary-term">resistance</span>. When the voltmeter leads are connected to two points in a circuit, that high value of resistance is connected in <span class="glossary-term">parallel</span> with that point and, due to <span class="glossary-term">Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law</span>, experiences the same value of <span class="glossary-term">voltage</span>. By measuring how much current flows across the meter’s internal resistance, it can calculate the voltage value.</p> <p>Voltmeters typically read zero volts when measuring between points of equal potential. Closed <span class="glossary-term">switches</span> and connected wires are examples of components that, when energized, are of equal potential.</p> <p>Voltmeters typically read line voltage when measuring between points of different potential. In a <span class="glossary-term">control circuit</span> this is line voltage. In the <span class="glossary-term">power circuit</span>, this is a phase-to-phase voltage, which is different from their phase-to-ground voltage.</p> <p>Open switches and <span class="glossary-term">contacts</span> are examples of components that a voltmeter would measure line voltage across.</p> <p>When current flows through a circuit, it drops off voltage proportional to the resistance of the device it flows through. Since closed switches and contacts offer nearly zero resistance, there will be no voltage drop measured across them. In every branch of a control schematic, there must be only one load to limit the current, and this device will have line voltage dropped across it when the circuit is operating. The coils of <span class="glossary-term">motor starters</span>, <span class="glossary-term">control relays</span>, and <strong>timer relays</strong> are examples of loads that when energized would have full line voltage dropped across them. <span class="glossary-term">Pilot lights</span> are another example of resistive loads that would experience full line voltage.</p> <h1>Ohmmeter</h1> <p>Disconnect circuit from power supply first! Before using an <span class="glossary-term">ohmmeter</span> in a circuit, use a voltmeter to confirm that power is off and that there is zero potential difference between the two points you wish to measure.</p> <p>An ohmmeter works by using an internal voltage source to push a small DC current through its leads. By measuring the value of current, it can display a calculated value of ohmic resistance. Because it has an internal voltage source, ohmmeters cannot ever be connected in live circuits as they could cause damage to equipment or injury to the operator.</p> <p>When using an ohmmeter in a control circuit, there are three typical readings you can get:</p> <ol><li><strong>Close-to-zero ohms:</strong> This means that the leads of the ohmmeter are connected across two points that are <span class="glossary-term">electrically common</span>. The two terminals of a closed switch or contact would give an ohmmeter reading close to zero <span class="glossary-term">ohms</span>.</li> <li><strong>Very-high-to-infinite ohms:</strong> An open in the circuit would allow zero current to flow and so would read as infinite ohms. The terminals of open switches and contacts would give very high ohmic readings.</li> <li><strong>Some ohms:</strong> An ohmmeter measuring across a load such as a pilot light would read a very high (approximately megaohms), but not infinite, value of ohms. This is one way of confirming that a pilot light is in good working condition. The terminals of a coil should have continuity and a low (approximately tens to hundreds of ohms), but not zero value of resistance. If a coil is shorted and reads zero ohms, it needs to be replaced.</li> </ol> <p>When using an ohmmeter to test <span class="glossary-term">fuses</span>, first confirm they are removed from the circuit. If a fuse is in good condition, it should give a close-to-zero reading of resistance. If the fuse has blown due to a fault, then it should behave as an open and give an infinite resistance reading.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_8ldrgs7t/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Electrical Meter Safety&amp;quot;" title="Electrical Meter Safety" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

If there is voltage at the source of supply, then you have confirmed that the problem is downstream from that point.</p> <p>If the main <span class="glossary-term">overcurrent</span> protection is provided by a <span class="glossary-term">circuit breaker</span>, check that the handle is in the “On” position, and not the “Off” or “Tripped” position. A circuit breaker indicates that it has tripped when the handle is in the centre position. To reset, push the handle fully off, then on. If the handle “trips” again suddenly, then there is likely a short circuit somewhere bypassing a load.</p> <p>If the main overcurrent protection is provided by a fusible disconnect, the status of the <span class="glossary-term">fuses</span> will determine if voltage is present. There are two tests that can confirm if a fuse link is intact: an <span class="glossary-term">ohmmeter</span> continuity test and the <span class="glossary-term">crisscross voltmeter method</span>.</p> </div></div>

Measure across each pair of line terminals (L1–L2; L2–L3; L3–L1). In the diagram below, that would mean using a <span class="glossary-term">voltmeter</span> to check between points 1-3; 3-5; 5-1. If any of these tests give a reading other than the phase-to-phase voltage, then check the incoming voltage upstream. If all three readings give a phase-to-phase voltage, then we know that voltage is present in the power circuit up to the fuses. The next test will confirm if the fuses are in good shape.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_187" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-187" style="width: 1024px"><img class="size-large wp-image-187" src="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-1024x600.png" alt="" width="1024" height="600" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-1024x600.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-300x176.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-768x450.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-1536x901.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-2048x1201.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-65x38.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-225x132.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/basicmotorcontrol/wp-content/uploads/sites/314/2020/01/Fuses-4-2-e1579711101425-350x205.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-187">Three phase fuses, fuse C is blown</div></div> <p>In the diagram above, all three readings give us a line-to-line voltage. To check the condition of the fuses, we measure from the line side of one fuse to the load side of another fuse.</p> <p>Using the diagram above, that would mean using a voltmeter to check between points 1-4; 3-6; 5-2. The readings we get back are:</p> <ul><li>1-4 = line voltage, therefor Fuse B is good</li> <li>3-6 = zero volts, therefor Fuse C is blown</li> <li>5-2 = line voltage, therefor Fuse A is good</li> </ul> <p>Because fuses A and B are in good condition, there is essentially no potential difference between points 1 and 2 and between points 3 and 4 respectively, and that is why the voltmeter reads line voltage on both sides of the fuse.</p> <p>With the power contacts open and fuse C blown, the voltmeter lead connected to point 6 is completely isolated from any other part of the circuit and so experiences zero potential difference.</p> <p>This method is called the crisscross voltmeter method because it is never necessary to check voltage through a fuse. If the fuse is in good condition as fuses A and B are, then we are measuring from points of equal potential, and if the fuse is blown, then our second voltmeter lead is isolated from the circuit, again giving us no potential difference. No useful information can be obtained from these measurements.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_20pae4t3/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Criss Cross&amp;quot;" title="Criss Cross" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.
