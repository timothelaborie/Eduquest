Perhaps you work in industry and want to enhance your skills. Or maybe you’re one of the hundreds of students world-wide who’ve been directed to this resource by an instructor. No matter your background, we’re happy to share this collaborative work that pulls together decades of industry experience and academic know-how.</p> <h1>An Introduction to the Industry</h1> <p>No textbook could cover, in depth, the tourism industry in BC and the global context for its development. This text is a stepping stone for further resources, and is written with a first year college and university audience in mind.</p> <h2>Created Through Collaboration</h2> <p>The book you’re reading was created through a collaborative process. It involved input from educators at multiple institutions, industry leaders, employers, and past graduates of BC’s tourism and hospitality management programs. The first iteration of the text was launched in 2015 by an organization called LinkBC; and in early 2020 a group of intrepid BC instructors rolled up their sleeves and edited the content to reflect the times.</p> <p>In this 2nd edition, all chapters have been revised with updated statistics, revised content and references added providing a more relevant and up to date reading experience.&nbsp; Several chapters such as Chapter 9 Customer Service, Chapter 10 Environmental Stewardship, and Chapter 12 Indigenous Tourism have been substantially rewritten as these areas have transformed considerably over the last several years. Internet links throughout have been reviewed and updated along with several modernized end-of-chapter exercises and case studies throughout the text. Lastly glossary terms have been hyperlinked.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><em><a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_z7zizzgb" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_z7zizzgb">Video: Introduction to 2nd Edition</a> by Wendy Anderson, Hospitality Programs Coordinator and Instructor, Selkirk College</em></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://vodcdn.ca.kaltura.com/p/148/sp/14800/thumbnail/entry_id/0_z7zizzgb/version/100002/width/608/height/402" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Introduction Video&amp;quot;" title="Introduction Video" /> <p>A BCcampus element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This textbook was originally put together in 2015 by a team of post-secondary educators led by Morgan Westcott, at that time with LinkBC. Last forward five years and it was realized that some edits needed to be done to update the information and keep it current. At the same time we started editing, the COVID pandemic hit the globe and Canada, and of course our beloved tourism industry came to a halt. Now tourism has gone through many shocks before, such as World War 2—well both World Wars—we had SARS, 9/11, and the 2008 economic crisis. After each of these shocks in the past, tourism has always rebounded stronger than ever. But as we edit this textbook, we really don’t know what the future will bring. So with that being said, most of the information that you will read is going to be pre-COVID. However, you will notice that many chapters make reference to COVID and its devastating impacts on the industry. You’ll read in Chapter 1 that our industry has several sectors and our text is divided into those sectors within our industry. The focus is on British Columbia and Canada, although we do make reference to some global content as well.</div> <div></div> <div>I’d like to just reach out and thank the 2020 editing team. It was a diverse group, as I said, from across BC’s post-secondary institutions. They included BCIT, Capilano University, College of the Rockies, North Island College, Royal Roads University, Selkirk College, and Vancouver Island University. I’d also like to should out to some industry professionals that helped us do the 2020 edits, including Go2HR and Heiltsuk First Nations. Enjoy reading your textbook, take the opportunity to dig deeper on some of the content. You will see some spotlights on sections of the text that you can click on external links. Please take the opportunity to do that. It will just make your understanding so much deeper. Enjoy your reading.</div> </div> <div class="textbox"><strong>A word on COVID-19:</strong> No crisis in recent memory has affected the global tourism landscape, and BC’s industry, like the pandemic novel coronavirus outbreak. At the time of editing it is early summer 2020 and BC is just starting the Province’s “Restart Plan.” As we re-write this text, we’ve made an effort to address the impacts of COVID-19, while trying to ensure some longevity to the book. We understand the information presented might not apply to your situation, or may be out-of-date as you’re reading, and we appreciate your understanding. Be sure to check with industry associations and local government for the most up-to-date information on the pandemic and other operational guidelines.</div> <h2>Chapter Organization</h2> <p>Each chapter is organized thematically, and moves from a global, to a national, to a provincial context. Some chapters will be quite global in focus while others will concentrate primarily on British Columbia. Chapter content is based on available data and research, and input from collaborators.</p> <h2>Additional Resources</h2> <p>Each chapter features “Spotlight On” textboxes that highlight an organization, business, or other key component of the chapter’s theme. “Take a Closer Look” features encourage students to do further reading on particular subjects.</p> <p>At the end of each chapter, key terms are presented in alphabetical order to help students gain confidence with terminology; these terms are summarized in a Glossary at the end of the textbook. These are followed by chapter exercises and a case study for in-depth exploration of the subject matter.</p> <p>Thanks for reading!</p> <p><em>Morgan Westcott, original lead author and member of the 2020 2nd Edition Update Team</em></p> <p><em>Wendy Anderson, 2nd Edition Update Team Lead<br /> </em></p> <h3>Media Attributions</h3> <ul><li>“<a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/w4nd3rl0st/7258766556/in/photolist-c4r5pw-nfhumW-c7eoJA-cZncgy-cpfEX7-o6YKzw-8nvQkZ-7Kc9qo-7Kc9yb-o8nsDX-axnua6-6G33Jp-9DnPAx-axqdoE-4bx2H6-dCdXaC-e4dxLP-4bEV1C-8vWS6M-4dajkY-4d6h8P-qjiKLj-fCKGsf-br6uHU-abaSWD-4aDw9T-4d64m2-axqdb7-axqctS-fqxcAH-4TWDPn-axnuMg-axnvJD-axqcCy-ddJP4p-axntTM-axnsoM-axnsY8-axq9Ts-axqcbU-axqbC9-axntmD-axntEt-4damHu-4d5PMa-aoWX9f-nnaQL9-aoWWRq-cZnccs-c4UFaw" data-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/w4nd3rl0st/7258766556/in/photolist-c4r5pw-nfhumW-c7eoJA-cZncgy-cpfEX7-o6YKzw-8nvQkZ-7Kc9qo-7Kc9yb-o8nsDX-axnua6-6G33Jp-9DnPAx-axqdoE-4bx2H6-dCdXaC-e4dxLP-4bEV1C-8vWS6M-4dajkY-4d6h8P-qjiKLj-fCKGsf-br6uHU-abaSWD-4aDw9T-4d64m2-axqdb7-axqctS-fqxcAH-4TWDPn-axnuMg-axnvJD-axqcCy-ddJP4p-axntTM-axnsoM-axnsY8-axq9Ts-axqcbU-axqbC9-axntmD-axntEt-4damHu-4d5PMa-aoWX9f-nnaQL9-aoWWRq-cZnccs-c4UFaw">The Lions – Lake Capilano, BC</a>” by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/w4nd3rl0st/" data-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/w4nd3rl0st/">Jason Mrachina</a> is licensed under a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 Licence</a>.</li> </ul> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>7258766556_45079856b7_k </li></ul></div> </div></div>

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-what-is-tourism" title="1.1 What is Tourism?"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">1</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">1.1 What is Tourism?</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Before engaging in a study of <span class="glossary-term">tourism</span>, let’s have a closer look at what this term means.</p> <h1>Definition of Tourism</h1> <p>There are a number of ways tourism can be defined, and for this reason, the <span class="glossary-term">United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)</span> embarked on a project from 2005 to 2007 to create a common glossary of terms for tourism. It defines tourism as follows:</p> <blockquote><div>Tourism is a social, cultural and economic phenomenon which entails the movement of people to countries or places outside their usual environment for personal or business/professional purposes. These people are called visitors (which may be either tourists or excursionists; residents or non-residents) and tourism has to do with their activities, some of which imply tourism expenditure (United Nations World Tourism Organization, 2008).</div> </blockquote> <p>Using this definition, we can see that tourism is not just the movement of people for a number of purposes (whether business or pleasure),&nbsp;but the overall agglomeration of activities, services, and involved sectors that make up the unique tourist experience.</p> <h1>Tourism, Travel, and Hospitality: What are the Differences?</h1> <p>It is common to confuse the terms <span class="glossary-term">tourism</span>, <span class="glossary-term">travel</span>, and <span class="glossary-term">hospitality</span> or to define them as the same thing. While tourism is the all-encompassing umbrella term for the activities and industry that create the tourist experience, the <span class="glossary-term">UNWTO</span> (2020) defines travel as the activity of moving between different locations often for any purpose but more so for leisure and recreation (Hall &amp; Page, 2006). On the other hand, hospitality can be defined as “the business of helping people to feel welcome and relaxed and to enjoy themselves” (Discover Hospitality, 2015, p. 3). Simply put, the hospitality industry is the combination of the accommodation and food and beverage groupings, collectively making up the largest segment of the industry (Go2HR, 2020). You’ll learn more about accommodations and F &amp; B in <a class="internal" href="#part-accommodation" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/accommodation/">Chapter 3</a> and <a class="internal" href="#part-food-and-beverage-services" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/food-and-beverage-services/">Chapter 4</a>, respectively.</p> <h1>Definition of Tourist and Excursionist</h1> <p>Building on the definition of tourism, a commonly accepted description of a <span class="glossary-term">tourist</span> is “someone who travels at least 80 km from his or her home for at least 24 hours, for business or leisure or other reasons” (LinkBC, 2008, p.8). The United Nations World Tourism Organization (1995) helps us break down this definition further by stating tourists can be:</p> <ol><li>Domestic (residents of a given country travelling only within that country)</li> <li class="column">Inbound (non-residents travelling in a given country)</li> <li class="column">Outbound (residents of one country travelling in another country)</li> </ol> <p><span class="glossary-term">Excursionists</span>&nbsp;on the other hand are considered same-day visitors (UNWTO, 2020). Sometimes referred to as “day trippers.” Understandably, not every visitor stays in a destination overnight. It is common for travellers to spend a few hours or less to do sightseeing, visit attractions, dine at a local restaurant, then leave at the end of the day.</p> <p>The scope of tourism, therefore, is broad and encompasses a number of activities and sectors.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO)</strong></p> <p>UNWTO is the United Nations agency responsible “for the promotion of responsible, sustainable and universally accessible tourism” (UNWTO, 2014b). Its membership includes 159 countries and over 500 affiliates such as private companies, research and educational institutions, and non-governmental organizations. It promotes tourism as a way of developing communities while encouraging ethical behaviour to mitigate negative impacts. For more information, visit the <a href="https://www.unwto.org" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.unwto.org">UNWTO website</a>.</p> </div> <h1 id="naics">NAICS: The North American Industry Classification System</h1> <p>Given the sheer size of the tourism industry, it can be helpful to break it down into broad industry groups using a common classification system. The <span class="glossary-term">North American Industry Classification System (NAICS)</span> was jointly created by the Canadian, US, and Mexican governments to ensure common analysis across all three countries (British Columbia Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training, 2013a). The tourism-related groupings created using NAICS are (in alphabetical order):</p> <ol><li>Accommodation</li> <li>Food and beverage services (commonly known as “F &amp; B”)</li> <li>Recreation and entertainment</li> <li>Transportation</li> <li>Travel services</li> </ol> <p>These industry groups (also commonly known as sectors) are based on the similarity of the “labour processes and inputs” used for each (Government of Canada, 2013). For instance, the types of employees and resources required to run an accommodation business whether it be a hotel, motel, or even a campground are quite similar. All these businesses need staff to check in guests, provide housekeeping, employ maintenance workers, and provide a place for people to sleep. As such, they can be grouped together under the heading of accommodation. The same is true of the other four groupings, and the rest of this text explores these industry groups, and other aspects of tourism, in more detail.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The combination of sectors that supply and distribute the needed tourism products, services, and activities within the tourism system is called the Tourism Supply Chain. Often, these chains of sectors and activities are dependent upon each other’s delivery of products and services.

Historically, the ability to travel was exclusive and reserved for royalty and the upper classes. From ancient Roman times to the 17th century, young men of high standing were encouraged to travel through Europe on a “grand tour”&nbsp;(Chaney, 2000). Through the Middle Ages, many societies encouraged the practice of religious pilgrimage, as reflected in Chaucer’s <em>Canterbury Tales</em> and other literature. Prescribed even earlier, the Hajj or the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, has made travel for religious purposes become a default for every believer of Islam.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1477" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1477" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-1728" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/izuddin-helmi-adnan-JFirQekVo3U-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="The night sky over worshippers surrounding a black cube-shaped building in a large courtyard." width="300" height="533" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1477">Figure 1.3 Hajj pilgrimage in Saudi Arabia.</div></div> <p>The word <span class="glossary-term">hospitality</span> predates the use of the word <span class="glossary-term">tourism</span>, and first appeared in the 14th century. It is derived from the Latin <em>hospes</em>, which encompasses the words <em>guest, host</em>, and <em>foreigner</em> (Latdict,&nbsp;2014). The word <em>tourist&nbsp;</em>appeared in print much later, in&nbsp;1772 (Griffiths and Griffiths, 1772). William Theobald suggests that the word&nbsp;<em>tour&nbsp;</em>comes from Greek and Latin words for <em>circle</em> and <em>turn, </em>and that <em>tourism</em> and <em>tourist&nbsp;</em>represent the activities of<em>&nbsp;</em>circling away from home, and then returning (Theobald, 1998).</p> <h1>Tourism Becomes Business</h1> <p>Cox &amp; Kings, the first known travel agency, was founded in 1758 when Richard Cox became official travel agent of the British Royal Armed Forces (Cox &amp; Kings, 2014). &nbsp;Almost 100&nbsp;years later, in&nbsp;June 1841, Thomas Cook opened the first leisure travel agency, designed to help Britons improve their lives by seeing the world and participating in the&nbsp;temperance movement. In 1845, he ran his first commercial packaged tour, complete with cost-effective railway tickets and a printed guide (Thomas Cook, 2014).</p> <p>The continued popularity of rail travel and the&nbsp;emergence&nbsp;of the automobile presented additional milestones in the development of tourism. In fact, a long journey&nbsp;taken by Karl Benz’s wife in 1886 served to kick off interest in auto travel and helped to publicize his budding car company, which would one day become Mercedes Benz (Auer, 2006). We take a closer look at the importance of car travel later in this chapter, and transportation within the tourism industry in <a class="internal" href="#part-transportation" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/transportation/">Chapter 2</a>.</p> <p>Fast forward to 1952, the dawn of the jet age&nbsp;saw the first commercial air flights from London, England to Johannesburg, South Africa and Colombo, Sri Lanka (Flightglobal, 2002) that many also heralded as the start of the modern tourism industry. The 1950s also saw the creation of Club&nbsp;Méditérannée (Gyr,&nbsp;2010) and similar club holiday destinations, the precursor of today’s all-inclusive resorts.</p> <p>The decade that followed is considered to have been a significant&nbsp;period in tourism development, as more travel companies came onto the scene, increasing competition for customers and moving toward “mass tourism, introducing new destinations and modes of holidaying” (Gyr, 2010, p.&nbsp;32).</p> <p>Industry growth has been interrupted at several key points in history, including World War I, the Great Depression, and World War II. At&nbsp;the start of this century,&nbsp;global events thrust international travel into decline including the September 11, 2001 attack on the World Trade Center in New York City&nbsp;(known as 9/11), the&nbsp;war in Iraq, perceived threat of future terrorist attacks, and health scares including SARS, BSE (bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and the West Nile&nbsp;virus (Government of Canada, 2006). But perhaps one of the most debilitating crises that has severely impacted tourism is the more recent COVID-19 pandemic.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1477" style="width: 225px"><img class="wp-image-1477 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A plane passenger wears a face mask and a face shield." width="225" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg 1920w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/camila-perez-dcmPJP8V8jU-unsplash-scaled-1-350x467.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.4 Cautious travel in the time of a pandemic.</div></div> <p>At the turn of the twentieth century, the&nbsp;industry experienced a significant technological shift as increased internet use revolutionized the promotions and distributions of travel products and services.

The first railway was launched in 1836 (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.),&nbsp;and by the onset of World&nbsp;War I in 1914, four railways dominated the Canadian landscape: <span class="glossary-term">Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)</span>, Canadian Northern Railway (CNOR),&nbsp;the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), and the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP). Unfortunately, their rapid expansion soon brought the last three into near bankruptcy (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.).</p> <p>In 1923, these three rail companies were amalgamated into the Canadian National Railway (CNR), and together with the CPR, these trans-continentals dominated the Canadian travel landscape until&nbsp;other forms of transportation became more popular. In 1978, with declining interest in rail travel, the CPR and CNR were forced to combine their passenger services to form VIA Rail (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.).</p> <h2>The Rise of the Automobile</h2> <p>The rising popularity of car travel was&nbsp;partially to blame for the decline in rail travel, although it took time to develop. When the&nbsp;first cross-country road&nbsp;trip took place in 1912, there were only&nbsp;16 kilometres&nbsp;of paved road across Canada&nbsp;(MacEachern,&nbsp;2012). Cars were initially considered&nbsp;a nuisance, and the National Parks Branch banned entry of automobiles,&nbsp;but later slowly began to embrace them. By&nbsp;the 1930s, some parks, such as&nbsp;Cape Breton Highlands National Park, were actually created to provide visitors with scenic drives&nbsp;(MacEachern,&nbsp;2012).</p> <p>It would take decades before a coast-to-coast highway was created, with the Trans-Canada Highway officially opening in Revelstoke in 1962. When it was fully completed in 1970, it was the longest national highway in the world, spanning one-fifth of the globe (MacEachern,&nbsp;2012).</p> <h2>Early Tourism Promotion</h2> <p>As early as 1892, enterprising Canadians like the Brewsters became the country’s first tour operators, leading guests through areas such as Banff National Park (Brewster Travel Canada, 2014). Communities across Canada developed their own marketing strategies as transportation development took hold. For instance, the&nbsp;town of Maisonneuve in Quebec launched a campaign from 1907 to 1915 calling itself “Le Pittsburg du Canada.” By&nbsp;1935, Quebec was spending $250,000 promoting tourism. Other provinces such as Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia followed suit, also enjoying the benefits of establishing provincial tourism bureaus (Dawson, 2004).</p> <h2>National Airlines</h2> <p>Our national airline, Air Canada, was formed in 1937 as Trans-Canada Air Lines. In many ways, Air Canada was a world leader in passenger aviation, introducing&nbsp;the world’s first computerized reservations system in 1963 (<em>Globe and Mail</em>, 2014).&nbsp;Through the 1950s and 1960s, reduced&nbsp;airfares saw increased mass travel.&nbsp;Competitors&nbsp;including&nbsp;Canadian Pacific (which became Canadian Airlines in 1987) began to launch international flights during this time to Australia, Japan, and South America (<em>Canadian Geographic, </em>2000).&nbsp;By 2000, Air Canada was facing&nbsp;financial peril and forced to restructure. A numbered company, owned in part by Air Canada, purchased 82% of Canadian Airline’s shares, with the result of&nbsp;Air Canada becoming the country’s only national airline (<em>Canadian Geographic, </em>2000).&nbsp;The 2000s saw Air Canada experiencing a roller-coaster performance from verging near bankruptcy in 2002, to reorganizations and fleet modernizations up to 2007, and another downturn due to the global recession in 2008 (ACE Aviation, 2011; Air Canada, 2007; CBC News, 2009).&nbsp; Air Canada experienced a number of transformations from interior and interior aircraft redesigns and further fleet upgrades from 2013 to 2017 (Air Canada, 2016).&nbsp; Once a rival airline, Air Transat was subsequently taken over by Air Canada in 2019 (CBC News, 2019).&nbsp; The near halt of the global tourism industry during the pandemic of COVID-19 in 2020 severely affected Air Canada, which posted a whopping $1 billion loss in its first quarter, cutting thousands of jobs, slashing 90% of its flight schedule, and foreseeing a tough and later rebound (Reynolds, 2020).</p> <h2>Parks and Protected Areas</h2> <p>A look at the evolution of tourism in Canada would be incomplete without a quick study of our national parks and protected areas. The official&nbsp;conservation of our natural spaces began around the same time as the railway boom, and&nbsp;in 1885 Banff was established as Canada’s first national park.&nbsp;By 1911, the Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act created the Dominion Parks Branch, the first of its kind in the world (Shoalts,&nbsp;2011).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1482" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1481" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Canoes floating on a pristine blue lake with towering mountains and trees in the background." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/matthew-fournier-ycv7guIlR9c-unsplash-scaled-1-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.6 Moraine Lake in the Canadian Rockies.</div></div> <p>The systemic conservation and celebration of Canada’s parks over the next century would help shape Canada’s identity, both at home and abroad. Through the 1930s, conservation officers and interpreters were hired to enhance visitor experiences. By 1970, the&nbsp;National Park System Plan divided&nbsp;Canada into 39 regions, with the goal of preserving each distinct ecosystem for future generations. In 1987, the country’s first&nbsp;national marine park was&nbsp;established in Ontario,&nbsp;and in the 20 years that followed, 10 new national&nbsp;parks and marine conservation areas&nbsp;were created (Shoalts,&nbsp;2011).</p> <p>The role of parks and protected areas in tourism is explored in greater detail in <a class="internal" href="#part-recreation" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/recreation/">Chapter 5</a> (Recreation) and <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a> (Environmental Stewardship).</p> <h2>Global Shock&nbsp;and Industry Decline</h2> <p>As with the global industry, Canada’s tourism industry was impacted by world events such as the Great Depression, the World Wars, socio-political turmoil, and global outbreak of disease.</p> <p>Global events such as 9/11, the SARS outbreak, the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, and the economic recession of 2008 took their toll on tourism receipts&nbsp;but have successfully seen short-term rebounds. However, nothing has been more impactful to the tourism industry as the corona virus of 2019 (COVID-19), which was first found in China in late 2019 and eventually declared as a pandemic by March 2020 as it spread globally.&nbsp; Tourism was placed in a standstill as global travel restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of infection.

In 1778,&nbsp;Captain James Cook touched down on Vancouver Island,&nbsp;followed by James Douglas in 1842, a British agent who had been sent to find new headquarters for the Hudson’s Bay Company, ultimately choosing&nbsp;Victoria. Through the 1860s, BC’s gold rush attracted prospectors from around the world, with towns and economies springing up along the trail (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).</p> <h2>Railway Travel: Full Steam Ahead!</h2> <p>The&nbsp;development of BC’s tourism industry began in earnest in the late 1800s&nbsp;when&nbsp;the CPR built accommodation properties along its newly completed trans-Canada route,&nbsp;capturing revenues from overnight stays to&nbsp;help alleviate their increasing corporate debt. Following the 1886 construction of&nbsp;small lodges at stops in&nbsp;Field, Rogers Pass, and Fraser Canyon, the CPR&nbsp;opened the Hotel Vancouver in May 1887 (Dawson, 2004).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1488" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1488" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-1485" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A train running through coniferous trees curves around a river beneath snowy mountains." width="300" height="450" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg 1707w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-200x300.jpg 200w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-1366x2048.jpg 1366w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-65x97.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-225x337.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/andy-holmes-oEIFOoC3gi0-unsplash-scaled-1-350x525.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1488">Figure 1.8 A CP freight train passing through the Canadian Rockies.</div></div> <p>As opposed to Atlantic Canada, where tourism promotion centred around attracting hunters and fishermen for a temporary infusion of cash, tourism in British Columbia&nbsp;was seen as a way to lure farmers and settlers to stay in the new province. Industry associations began to form quickly: the Tourist Association of Victoria (TAV) in&nbsp;February 1902, and the Vancouver Tourist Association in June of the same year&nbsp;(Dawson, 2004).</p> <p>Many of the campaigns struck by these and other organizations&nbsp;between 1890 and 1930 centred on the province’s natural assets, as&nbsp;people sought to escape modern convenience and enjoy the environment. A collaborative&nbsp;group called the Pacific Northwest Travel Association (BC, Washington, and Oregon) promoted&nbsp;“The Pacific Northwest: The World’s Greatest Out of Doors,” calling BC “The Switzerland of North America.” Promotions like these seemed to have had an effect: in&nbsp;1928, over 370,000 tourists visited Victoria, spending over $3.5 million&nbsp;(Dawson, 2004).</p> <h2>The Great Depression and World War II</h2> <p>As the world’s economy was sent into peril during&nbsp;the Great Depression in the 1930s, tourism was seen as an economic solution. A&nbsp;newly renamed Greater Victoria Publicity Bureau developed strategies to promote tourism spending, with visitor revenues accounting for around&nbsp;13.5%&nbsp;of BC’s&nbsp;income in&nbsp;1930. By 1935, an organization known as the&nbsp;TTDA (Tourist Trade Development Association of Victoria and Vancouver Island) looked to create a more stable industry through strategies to increase visitors’ length of stay (Dawson, 2004).</p> <p>In 1937, the provincial Bureau of Industrial and Tourist Development (BITD) was formed through special legislation&nbsp;with a goal of increasing tourist traffic. By 1938, the organization changed its&nbsp;name to the <span class="glossary-term">British Columbia Government Travel Bureau (BCGTB)</span> and was granted a budget increase to $105,000. In 1939, Vancouver welcomed the King and Queen of England and celebrated the opening of the Lions Gate Bridge, activities that reportedly bolstered tourism numbers (Dawson, 2004).</p> <p>The December 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii&nbsp;had negative repercussions for tourism in the Pacific Rim and was responsible for&nbsp;an era of decreased visitation to British Columbia, despite attempts by some to market the region as exciting. From 1939 to 1943, US visits to Vancouver dropped from over 307,000 to approximately 183,600. Just two years later, however, that number jumped to 369,250, as a result of campaigns like the 1943 initiative aimed at Americans that&nbsp;marketed BC as “comrades in war” (Dawson, 2004).</p> <h2>Post-War Rebound</h2> <blockquote><div>We, with all due modesty, cannot help but claim that we are entering British Columbia’s half-century, and cannot help but observe that B.C. also stands for BOOM COUNTRY. —Phil Gagliardi, BC Minister of Highways, 1955 (Dawson, 2004, p.190)</div> </blockquote> <p>A burst of post-war spending began in 1946, and although short-lived, was supported by steady government investment in marketing throughout the 1950s. As tourism grew in BC, however, so did competition for US dollars from Mexico, the Caribbean, and Europe. The decade that followed saw an emphasis on promoting BC’s history, its “Britishness,” and the commodification of Indigenous culture. The BCGTB began marketing efforts to extend the travel season, encouraging travel in September during prime fishing season. The bureau also promoted visitors to explore specific areas, including the Lower Fraser Valley, the Okanagan-Fraser Canyon Loop, and the Kamloops-Cariboo region (Dawson, 2004).</p> <p>In 1954, Vancouver hosted the British Empire Games, investing in the construction of Empire Stadium. A few years later, an&nbsp;increased emphasis&nbsp;on events and convention business saw the Greater Vancouver Tourist Association&nbsp;change its&nbsp;name in 1962 to the Greater Vancouver Visitors and Convention&nbsp;Bureau (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).</p> <p>The ski industry was also on the rise: in 1961, the lodge and chairlift on Tod Mountain (now&nbsp;Sun Peaks) opened, and Whistler followed suit five years later&nbsp;(PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009). Ski partners became pioneers of collaborative marketing in the province with the foundation of the Ski Marketing Advisory Committee (SMAC) supported by Tod Mountain and Big White, evolving into today’s Canada’s West Ski Area Association (Magnes, 2010). This pioneer spirit was evident across the ski sector: the entire sport of heliskiing was invented by Hans Gosmer of BC’s Canadian Mountain Holidays. The province also held the title of having 90% of the world’s heliskiing market share back in 2016 (McLeish, 2014).</p> <p>The concept of collaboration extended throughout the province as innovative funding structures saw the cost of marketing programs shared between government and industry in BC. These programs were distributed through regional Destination Marketing Organizations (DMOs) and considered “the most constructive and forward looking plan of its kind in Canada” (Dawson 2004, p.194).</p> <p>Tourism in BC continued to grow through the 1970s. In 1971, the Hotel Room Tax Act was introduced, allowing for a&nbsp;5% tax to be collected on room nights with the funds collected to be put&nbsp;toward marketing and development. By 1978, construction had begun&nbsp;on Whistler Village, with Blackcomb Mountain opening two years later (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009). Funding programs in the late 1970s and early 1980s such as the Canada BC Tourism Agreement (CBCTA) and Travel Industry Development Subsidiary Agreement (TIDSA) allowed communities to invest in projects that would make them more attractive tourism destinations. In the mountain community of Kimberley, for instance, the following improvements were implemented through a $3.1 million forgivable loan: a new road to the ski resort, a covered tennis court, a mountain lodge, an alpine slide, and nine more holes for the golf course (e-Know, 2011).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1488" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1486" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/pamela-saunders-yV8hguKKMq0-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Four snowboarders ride a chairlift high above the ground.

Tourism in the province was about to truly take off.</p> <h2>Expo 86 and Beyond</h2> <p>By the time the world fair Expo 86 came to a close in October 1986, it had played host to&nbsp;20 million guests. Infrastructure developments, including rapid rail (SkyTrain), airport improvements, a new trade and convention centre at Canada Place (with a cruise ship terminal), and hotel construction, had positioned the city and the province for further growth (PricewaterhouseCooopers, 2009). The construction and opening of the Coquihalla Highway through to 1990 enhanced the travel experience and reduced travel times to vast sections of the province (Magnes, 2010).</p> <p>By 2000, Vancouver International Airport (YVR) was named number one in the world by the&nbsp;International Air Transport Association’s survey of international passengers. Five years later, the airport welcomed&nbsp;a record 16.4 million passengers (PricewaterhouseCoopers, 2009).</p> <h2>Going for Gold</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1488" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1487" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland.jpg" alt="A crowd of people dressed in red and white Canadian jerseys cheer from arena seats." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland.jpg 1920w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canada-vs.-Switzerland-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.10 The crowd at the Canada vs. Switzerland men’s hockey game during the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics.</div></div> <p>In 2003, the International Olympic Committee named&nbsp;Vancouver/Whistler&nbsp;as the host city for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games.

Back in September 1933, an article in the <em>Victoria Daily Times</em> argued for more coordination across organizations in order to capitalize on what they&nbsp;saw as Canada’s “largest dividend payer” (Dawson, 2004). Today, more than&nbsp;80 years later, you will often hear BC tourism professionals&nbsp;say the same thing.</p> <p>On the other hand, some experts believe that the industry is simply a model of <span class="glossary-term">diversity</span>, acknowledging that tourism is a compilation of a multitude of businesses, services, organizations, and communities. They see the ways in which these components are working together toward success, rather than focusing on friction between the groups.</p> <p>Many communities are placing a renewed focus on educating the general public and other businesses about the value of tourism and the ways in which stakeholders work together. The following case study highlights this in more detail:</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Tourism Pays in Richmond, BC<br /> </strong></p> <p>The community of&nbsp;Richmond, BC, brings to life the far-reaching positive economic effects of tourism in action.

Proud owner of a working blueberry farm and big-time supporter of promoting tourism. So why does a blueberry farmer care about tourism? Well, let me tell you a little story about John and Jane.</p> <p>John and Jane: Hi!</p> <p>Dave: They thought it would be nice to take a vacation. John had ideas, and Jane had ideas. But as they talked, they couldn’t decide where to go. They knew their perfect place was out there. They just had to find it. Jane flipped through magazines. John started noticing the vacation ads on TV. On his way to work, John saw billboards and heard radio ads.</p> <p><em>[Muffled radio in the background.]</em></p> <p>Dave: And once he got there, he talked to his friends about where they spent their vacations. Jane did some research on the internet, visiting different websites, to see which places had what they were looking for. After seeing all their options, John and Jane came to the same conclusion.</p> <p>John and Jane: We found the Perfect Place!</p> <p>Dave: They were so excited, they started to plan their trip right away. After booking their flights, John was eager to line up some things to do in the Perfect Place. So he visited the Perfect Place’s website, watched a video, checked out the hotels, bought tickets to a ball game, and signed up for the Perfect Place’s e-newsletter especially for visitors. John also downloaded the Perfect Place’s smartphone app so he could get information on the go. Jane liked the Perfect Place’s Facebook page and followed the Perfect Place on Twitter so she could get updates, ideas, and special deals.</p> <p><em>[Beeping from Jane dialing the phone]</em></p> <p>Dave: Jane also called the toll-free number and spoke to a nice lady who told her everything she needed to know about the Perfect Place. Jane also got the visitor’s guide, which helped her learn what theatre productions were in town, where to eat, and other things to do in the Perfect Place. So John and Jane had explored their options, booked their travel, and planned their vacation. They packed their bags and off they went. End of story, right?</p> <p>Actually, this is where the real story begins. Because what do you think John and Jane do when they get to the Perfect Place? Guess what? They spend their money <em>[ca-ching].</em> They spend their money on their rental car, in their hotel, seeing the attractions, enjoying outdoor activities, shopping, and dining out <em>[glasses clink]</em><em>.</em> They’re happy they came to the Perfect Place.</p> <p>John and Jane: Woohoo!</p> <p>Dave: You know who else is happy? The hotel they stayed in, of course, and the bellman at the hotel, the workers at the local company that supplies his uniform, the stores they shop at, and the banks they use. And then there’s the restaurant where John and Jane ate dinner. And the waitress who served them their wine? She’s happy, too. So is the local vineyard who grew the grapes that made the wine, the people who bottled it, and the drivers who brought it into town. And the blueberry farmer who supplied the blueberries for the cobbler that the waitress served John and Jane for dessert.</p> <p>That’s why someone like me cares about tourism in somewhere like the Perfect Place. Yes, I am a farmer, but I am also a business man, and I can draw a lot of conclusions form that story. I bet you can too. Tourism creates jobs. It brings in spending. And tourists pay taxes, which means locals pay less. But tourism in competitive, and without the marketing engine that drives it, John and Jane will take their money to some other destination, where it will benefit some other local economy. Let’s make sure our local economy grows. Let’s feed it, let’s nurture it, help it along, so it becomes strong, healthy, and delicious.</p> <p><em>[Upbeat music]</em></p> <p>Words on the screen: Thanks for visiting the Perfect Place. Thanks for visiting Richmond, British Columbia. Tourism in Richmond:</p> <ul><li>Is the largest industry (retail, accommodations, attractions, transportation).</li> <li>Results in $650 million in economic output.</li> <li>Directly employs more than 7,400 people earning $220 million in wages.</li> <li>Contributes $250 million in non-accommodations spending.</li> <li>Brings in excess of 4 million person nights.</li> <li>Generates $135 million in taxes: $76 million federal, $44 million provincial, and $15 million municipal.</li> <li>Supported an 123% increase in the number of hotel rooms over the last 15 years.</li> </ul> <p>Dave: Tourism is vital to us. Like beef to Alberta, like potash to Saskatchewan, or manufacturing to Ontario. Without marketing funding, many visitors will find the perfect place somewhere else. Tourism pays for everyone.</p> <p>Words on the screen: Brought to you by Tourism Richmond.</p> </div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1488" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1488" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1.jpg" alt="A small airplane statue outside the doorway to a boardroom." width="400" height="266" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-300x199.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-768x511.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-2048x1362.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Canadian-Tourism-College-Boardroom-scaled-1-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 1.11 The doorway to a boardroom in the Canadian Tourism College.</div></div> <p>Throughout the rest of this textbook, you will have a chance to learn&nbsp;more about the history and current outlook for&nbsp;tourism in BC, with in-depth coverage of some of the triumphs and challenges we face as an industry.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-1-x-impacts-of-tourism" title="1.5 Impacts of Tourism"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">5</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">1.5 Impacts of Tourism</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>As you can already see,&nbsp;the&nbsp;impacts of the global tourism industry today are impressive and far reaching. Let’s have a closer look at some of these outcomes.</p> <h1>Tourism Impacts</h1> <p>Tourism can generate positive or negative impacts under three main categories:&nbsp;economic, social, and environmental. These impacts are analyzed using data gathered by businesses, governments, and industry organizations.</p> <h2>Economic Impacts</h2> <p>According to the <a href="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284421152" data-url="https://www.e-unwto.org/doi/book/10.18111/9789284421152">2019 edition of the UNWTO International Tourism Highlights report</a>, international tourist arrivals reached 1.4 billion, a 5% increase in 2018. UNWTO Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili stated that the sheer growth of the industry was driven by a strong global economy, surge of the travel-ready middle class from emerging economies, technological advances, and more affordable travel costs among others (UNWTO, 2019). At the same time, the UNWTO (2019) reported export earnings from tourism, or the sum of international tourism receipts and passenger transport, reached a staggering USD 1.7 trillion. This demonstrates that the industry is a major economic engine of growth and development.</p> <p>Europe has traditionally been the region with the highest tourism dollar spending with USD 570 billion, followed by Asia and the Pacific (USD 435 billion), the Americas (USD 334 billion), Middle East (USD 73 billion), and Africa (USD 38 billion). Asia has shown to have the strongest growths in both arrivals (+7%) and spending (+7%). Africa equally shared a +7% growth in arrivals, suggesting a new interest in travelling to the continent.</p> <p>What are the trends that are motivating people to travel? The six consumer travel trends, according to the UNWTO (2019) include:</p> <ul><li>Travel “to change” or focusing on more authentic travel, transformation, and living like a local.</li> <li>Travel “to show” or capturing “instagramable” moments, experiences, and visiting selfie-worthy destinations.</li> <li>Pursuit of a healthy life or engaging into active travel that involves walking, wellness, and sports tourism.</li> <li>Rise of the “access” economy.</li> <li>Solo travel and multigenerational travel as a result of single households and an aging population.</li> <li>Rising awareness on travel with sustainable advocacies, thoughtful consideration about climate change impacts, and plastic-free travel.</li> </ul> <p><span style="font-family: Helvetica, Arial, 'GFS Neohellenic', sans-serif; font-size: 1em; font-weight: bold;">Social Impacts</span></p> <p>Because tourism experiences also involve human interaction, certain impacts may occur.&nbsp;Generally, social impacts in tourism are related to guest-to-host or host-to-guest influences and changes. Studies of these encounters often relate to the Social Exchange Theory, which describe how tourists and hosts’ behaviours change as a result of the perceived benefits and threats they create during interaction (Nunkoo, 2015).</p> <p>Positive social impacts in tourism include learning about different cultures, increasing tolerance and inclusion through LGBTQ+ travel, increasing amenities (e.g., parks, recreation facilities), investment in arts and culture, celebration of <span class="glossary-term">Indigenous peoples</span>, and community pride. When developed conscientiously, tourism can, and does, contribute to a positive quality of life for residents and a deeper learning and appreciation for tourists.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1491" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1491" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1491" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg" alt="Two women wrapped in rainbow pride flags face a street with their backs to the camera." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1.jpg 2560w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-2048x1366.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/mercedes-mehling-2KSc1toxle8-unsplash-scaled-1-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1491">Figure 1.12 LGBTQ+ travel is gaining momentum.</div></div> <p>Unfortunately, tourism also has its shortcomings and is culpable for some detrimental impacts.&nbsp;However, as identified by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP, 2003a),&nbsp;negative social impacts of tourism can include:</p> <ul><li>Change or loss of indigenous identity and values</li> <li>Culture clashes</li> <li>Physical causes of social stress (increased demand for resources)</li> <li>Ethical issues (such as an increase in sex tourism or the exploitation of child workers)</li> </ul> <p>Some of these issues are explored in further detail in <a class="internal" href="#part-indigenous-tourism" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/indigenous-tourism/">Chapter 12</a>, which examines the development of Indigenous tourism in British Columbia.</p> <h2>Environmental Impacts</h2> <p>Tourism relies on, and greatly impacts, the natural environment in which it operates. In many cases, the environment is an essential resource that outdoor recreation and ecotourism cannot exist without. Even though many areas of the world are conserved in the form of parks and protected areas, tourism development can still have severe negative impacts from misuse, overuse, and neglect. According to UNEP (2003b), these can include:</p> <ul><li>Depletion of natural resources (water, forests, etc.)</li> <li>Pollution (air pollution, noise, sewage, waste and littering)</li> <li>Physical impacts (construction activities, marina development, trampling, loss of biodiversity)</li> </ul> <p>The environmental impacts of tourism knows no boundaries and can reach outside local areas and have detrimental effects on the&nbsp;global ecosystem. One example is increased emissions from necessary tourism elements such as transportation. Air travel for instance, is a major contributor to climate&nbsp;change. <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a> looks at the environmental impacts of tourism in more detail.</p> <p>A overview of the negative and positive impacts:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

It encompasses domestic, inbound, and outbound travel for business, leisure, or other purposes. And because of this large scope, tourism development requires participation from all walks of life,&nbsp;including private business, governmental agencies,&nbsp;educational institutions, communities, and citizens.</p> <p>Recognizing the diverse nature of the industry and the significant contributions tourism makes toward economic and social value for British Columbians is important. There remains a great deal of work to better educate members of the tourism industry, other sectors, and the public about the ways tourism contributes to our province.</p> <p>Given this opportunity for greater awareness, it is hoped that students like you will help share this information as you learn more about the sector. So let’s begin our exploration in Chapter 2 with a closer look at a critical sector: transportation.

Read the <a href="http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_orig.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.icao.int/publications/Documents/7300_orig.pdf">1944 Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation [PDF]</a>.</p> </div> <p>Canada’s approach to open skies is&nbsp;the <span class="glossary-term">Blue Sky Policy</span>, first implemented in 2006.&nbsp;The&nbsp;National Airlines Council of Canada (NACC) and Canadian Airports Council (CAC) support the Blue Sky Policy.</p> <p>While opening up air transport agreements (ATAs) with other jurisdictions is important, the Canadian government does not provide blanket arrangements, instead, negotiating “when it is in Canada’s overall interest to do so” (Government of Canada, 2014a). Some suggest the government should be more liberal with air access so more competitors can enter the market, potentially attracting more visitors to the country (Fu, Oum, &amp; Zhang (2010); Gill &amp; Raynor, 2003).</p> <h2>Taxes and Fees</h2> <p>For years, the aviation industry has argued that the high level of taxes and fees are unsustainable for the sector. According to a 2012 Senate study on issues related to the Canadian airline industry, Canadian travellers are being grounded by airline fees, fuel surcharges, security taxes, airport improvement fees, and other additional costs. Airports are charged rental fees by the Canadian government ($4.8 billion from 1992 to 2004), which they pass on to the airlines, who in turn transfer the costs to travellers. Some think eliminating rental fees would make Canadian airports more competitive, and view rental and other fees as the reason 5 million Canadians went south of the border for flights in 2013, where passenger fees are 230% lower than in Canada (Hermiston &amp; Steele, 2014).</p> <h1>Profitability</h1> <blockquote><div>Running an airline is like having a baby: fun to conceive, but hell to deliver.<br /> —C. E. Woolman, principal founder of Delta Air Lines (<em>The Economist</em>, 2011).</div> </blockquote> <p>As the quote above suggested, airlines are faced with many challenges. In addition to operating in a strict regulatory environment, airlines yield extremely small profit margins. Passenger growth in 2017 was supported by a broad-based improvement in global economic conditions and by lower airfares, mainly earlier in the year. Lower fares have been a tailwind for passenger demand since late 2014 and have helped to drive the RPK/GDP multiplier above its long-term median level for three years in a row. In 2017 the industry accumulated $&nbsp; billion worldwide in revenues, although global profit margins were just 1.5% (IATA, 2014a). To put that into perspective, while the average airline earned 1.5%, Amazon’s profit margins were almost 14 times that at 20.15% (YCharts, 2014).</p> <h2>Passenger Load Factor</h2> <p>Key to airline profitability is the <span class="glossary-term">passenger load factor</span><em>, </em>which relates how efficiently planes are being used. The load factor for a single flight can be determined by dividing the number of passengers by the number of seats. Demand grew faster than capacity, increasing the passenger load factor by 0.7 percentage points in 2019.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1499" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1499" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800.jpg" alt="A two-decker plane picks up speed on a runway." width="400" height="225" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800.jpg 1920w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-300x169.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-768x432.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-65x37.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-225x127.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Airbus-380-800-350x197.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2.2 An Airbus 380-800 takes off.</div></div> <p>Passenger load factors in the airline industry reached a high of 80.3% in 2019, which was attributed to increased volumes and strong capacity management in key sectors (IATA, 2104a). One way of increasing capacity is by using larger aircraft. For instance, the introduction of the Airbus A380 model has allowed up to 40% more capacity per flight, carrying up to 525 passengers in a three-class configuration, and up to 853 in a single-class configuration (Airbus, 2014). Some carriers are now retiring the A380 model from their fleet (Airbus, 2020).</p> <h2>Ultra Low-Cost Carriers</h2> <p>Another key factor in profitability is the airline’s business model. In 1971, Southwest Airlines became the first <span class="glossary-term">low-cost carrier (LCC)</span>, revolutionizing the industry. The LCC model involved charging for all extras such as reserved seating, baggage, and on-board service, and cutting costs by offering less legroom and using non-unionized workforces. Typically, an LCC has to run with 90% full planes to break even (Owram, 2014). The high-volume, lower-service system is what we have become used to today, but at the time it was introduced, it was groundbreaking. Over the past several years, the model is now called an <strong>Ultra Low Cost Carrier</strong> (<strong>ULCC</strong>) with extremely low costs and unbundled services. Examples of Canadian ultra low-cost carriers include Swoop and Flair.</p> <h2>Ancillary Revenues</h2> <div><p>The LCC and ULCC models, combined with tight margins, led to today’s climate where passengers are charged for value-added services such as meals, headsets, blankets, seat selection, and bag checking. These are known in the industry as <span class="glossary-term">ancillary revenues</span>. Profits from these extras rose from $36 billion in 2012 to $42 billion in 2013, or more than $13 a passenger.&nbsp;An average net profit of only $3.39 per passenger was retained by airlines (IATA, 2014a).</p> <p>As you can see, airlines must strive to maintain profitability, despite thin margins, in an environment with heavy government regulation. But at the same time, they must be responsible for the safety of their passengers.</p> <h1>Air Safety and Security</h1> <p>IATA encourages airlines to view safety from a number of points, including&nbsp;reducing operational risks such as plane crashes, by running safety audit programs. They&nbsp;also advocate for improved infrastructure such as runway upgrades and training for pilots and other crew. Finally, they strive to understand&nbsp;emerging safety issues, including the outsourcing of operations to third-party companies (IATA, 2014a).</p> <p>In terms of security, coordination between&nbsp;programs such as the Interpol Stolen and Lost Travel Documents initiative and other databases is critical (IATA, 2014a). As reservations and management systems become increasingly computerized, cyber-security becomes a top concern for airlines, who must protect IT (information technology) because their&nbsp;databases contain information about&nbsp;flights and passengers’ personal&nbsp;information. Unruly passengers are also a cause of concern, with over 8,000 incidents reported worldwide every year (IATA, 2014a).</p> <p>Now that we have a better sense of the complexities of the industry, let’s take a closer look at&nbsp;air travel in Canada and the regional air industry.</p> <h1>Canada’s Air Industry</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1500" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1500" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1500" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz.jpg" alt="An airplane sits on a runway." width="400" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz.jpg 1280w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Air-Canada-Jazz-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1500">Figure 2.3 An Air Canada Jazz plane readies for takeoff.</div></div> <p>In 1937, Trans-Canada Air Lines (later to become Air Canada) was launched with two passenger planes and one mail plane. By the 1950s,<b>&nbsp;</b>Canadian Pacific Airlines (CP Air) entered the marketplace, and an economic boom led to more affordable tickets. Around this time CP Air (which became Canadian Airlines in 1987) launched&nbsp;flights to Australia, Japan, and South America (Canadian Geographic, 2000). In 2001, Canadian Airlines International was acquired by Air Canada (Aviation Safety Network, 2012).</p> <p>In 1996, the marketplace changed drastically&nbsp;with the entry of an Alberta-based LCC&nbsp;called WestJet. &nbsp;By 2014, WestJet had grown to become Canada’s second major airline with more than 9,700 staff&nbsp;flying to 88 destinations across&nbsp;domestic and international networks (WestJet, 2014).</p> <p>As it grew, WestJet began to offer services such as premium economy class and a frequent-flyer program, launched a regional carrier, and introduced transatlantic flights with service to Dublin, Ireland, evolving away from the LCC model (Owram, 2014). With those changes, and in the absence of a true low-cost carrier, in 2014, some other companies, added ULCC such as Swoop in 2019 and Flair Airlines.</p> <p>However, outside of Air Canada and WestJet, airlines in Canada have found it very challenging&nbsp;to survive, and some examples of LCC startups like Harmony Airways and Jetsgo have fallen by the wayside.</p> <h2>Challenges to Canada’s Air Industry</h2> <p>When looking at these failed airlines in Canada, three key challenges to success can be identified&nbsp;(Owram, 2014):</p> <ol><li>Canada’s large geographical size and sparse population mean relatively low demand for flights.</li> <li>Canada’s higher taxes and fees compared with other jurisdictions (such as the United States) make pricing less competitive.</li> <li>Canada’s two dominant airlines are able to price new entrants out of the market.</li> </ol> <p>In addition to these factors, the European debt crisis, a slow&nbsp;US economic recovery, more cautious spending by Canadians, and fuel price increases led to&nbsp;a $900 million industry loss in 2011 (Conference Board of Canada, 2012) prior to the industry returning to profitability&nbsp;in 2013.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: One Size Doesn’t Fit All</strong></p> <p>In 2013, a special report to the Canadian Senate explored the concept that one size doesn’t fit all when it comes to competitiveness in the country’s airline industry. The report contains general observations about the industry as well as a number of recommendations to stakeholders, including airport managers. Read the report: <a href="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/trcm/rep/rep08apr13-e.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.parl.gc.ca/Content/SEN/Committee/411/trcm/rep/rep08apr13-e.pdf">“One Size Doesn’t Fit All: the Future Growth and Competitiveness of Canadian Air Travel” [PDF]</a>.</p> </div> <p>Today, the Canadian airline industry directly employs roughly 141,000 people and is worth $34.9 billion in gross domestic product. It supports 330 jobs for every 100,000 passengers and contributes over $12 billion to federal and provincial treasuries, including over $7 billion in taxes (Gill and Raynor, 2013). In 2019, Canadian airlines carried over 80 million passengers and are a critical component of Canada’s overall air transport and tourism sector and support over 630,000 jobs (NACC, 2019).</p> <p>Let’s now turn our attention to the regional air&nbsp;market, focusing on British Columbia.</p> <h2>Regional Airlines</h2> <p>Transportation in BC has&nbsp;always been difficult: incomplete road systems and rugged terrain historically made travel between communities almost impossible.&nbsp;In&nbsp;1927, a number of businessmen promised to change all that when they opened&nbsp;British Columbia Airways in Victoria with the purchase of a commercial airliner (Canadian Museum of Flight, 2014).</p> <p>As commercial flying became more popular, and the province grew, regional airports started to&nbsp;spring up around BC as a means of delivering surveying equipment, forestry supplies, and workers. Many of these airports were legacies of Canada’s strategic position for the military. Fort Nelson’s airport, for instance, was established so&nbsp;the US Air Force could&nbsp;fuel aircraft bound for Russia in World War II (Northern Rockies Regional Airport, 2014).</p> <p>In 1994, Transport Canada&nbsp;transferred all 150 airports under its control to local authorities under the <span class="glossary-term">National Airports Policy (NAP)</span>. This policy is considered to have been a turning point in the&nbsp;privatization of the airline industry in Canada.&nbsp;A 2004 study showed that after 10 years, 48% of these airports were not able to cover annual costs of operation, leading&nbsp;to concerns about the viability of small local airports in particular (InterVISTAS, 2005).</p> <p>In 2012, the BC government released its aviation strategy, entitled <em>Connecting with the World</em>, which acknowledged the economic challenges for&nbsp;airports large and small. These range from Vancouver International Airport (YVR), which supports more than 61,000 jobs and creates&nbsp;more than $11 billion in economic activity each year, through to regional and local airports. The&nbsp;strategy outlined a framework to remove barriers to aviation growth including potentially eliminating the two-cent-per-litre International Aviation Fuel Tax (British Columbia Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, 2012).</p> <p>Given a&nbsp;highly complex regulatory environment, razor-thin profit margins, and intense competition, the airline industry is constantly changing and evolving at global, national, and regional levels. But one thing is certain: air travel is here to stay.</p> <p>On the other hand, the rail industry has been faced with significant declines since air travel became accessible to the masses.

That’s because in many places, including Canada and British Columbia, trains were an unprecedented way to move people across vast expanses of land. With the Canadian Pacific company opening up hotels in major cities, BC’s hospitality sector was born and rail travel emerged.</p> <h1>Profitability</h1> <p>However, starting in the 1940s and 1950s, the passenger rail industry began to decline sharply. In 1945, Canadian railways carried 55.4 million passengers, but just 10 years later passenger traffic had dropped to 27.2 million. The creation of VIA Rail in 1977 as a Canadian Crown corporation was an attempt by the government to ensure rail travel did not disappear, but in the years since its founding, VIA has struggled, relying heavily on federal subsidies in order to continue operations.</p> <p>Between 1989 and 1990, VIA lost over 45% of its ridership when&nbsp;it cut unprofitable routes, focusing&nbsp;on areas with better potential for revenue and passenger volumes. From there, annual ridership has stabilized at around 3.5&nbsp;million to 4.0&nbsp;million passengers per year, slowly increasing throughout the 1990s and 2000s (Dupuis, 2011).</p> <p>Despite this slight recovery, there are a number of challenges for passenger rail in Canada, which will likely require continued government support to survive. Three key challenges to a successful passenger rail industry are:</p> <ol><li>Passenger rail must negotiate with freight for the right-of-use of tracks.</li> <li>There is a limited potential of routes (with the highest volume existing in the Quebec-Windsor corridor).</li> <li>Fixed-cost equipment is ageing out, requiring replacement or upgrading.</li> </ol> <p>High-speed rail seems like an attractive option, but would be expensive to construct as existing tracks aren’t suitable for the reasons given above. It’s also unlikely to provide high enough returns to private investors (Dupuis, 2011). This means the Canadian government would have to invest heavily in a rapid rail project for it to proceed. As of 2020, no such investment was planned.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Rocky Mountaineer Rail Tours</strong></p> <p>Founded in 1990, Rocky Mountaineer offers three train journeys through BC&nbsp;and Alberta to Banff, Lake Louise, Jasper, and Calgary, and one train excursion from Vancouver to Whistler.&nbsp;In 2013, Rocky Mountaineer introduced Coastal Passage, a new route connecting Seattle to the Canadian Rockies that can be added to any two-day or more rail journey (Rocky Mountaineer, 2014).&nbsp;For more information, please visit the <a href="http://www.rockymountaineer.com" data-url="http://www.rockymountaineer.com">Rocky Mountaineer website</a>.</p> </div> <p>While the industry overall has been in a decline, touring companies like Rocky Mountaineer have found a financially successful model by shifting the focus from transportation to the sightseeing experience. The company has weathered financial storms by refusing to discount their luxury product, instead, focusing on unique experiences. The long planning cycle for scenic rail packages has helped the company stand their ground in terms of pricing (Cubbon, 2010). The product-experience is stratified into two “World-Class Service” guest experience choices, namely the Silver Leaf and the Gold Leaf for their three rail routes.</p> <h1>Rail Safety</h1> <p>In Canada, rail safety is governed by the <span class="glossary-term">Railway Safety Act</span>,&nbsp;which ensures safe railway operation and amends other laws that relate to rail safety (Government of Canada, 2014b). The Act is overseen by the Minister of Transport. It covers grade crossings, mining and construction near railways, operating certifications, financial&nbsp;penalties for infractions, and safety management.</p> <p>The Act was revised&nbsp;in late 2014 in response to the massive rail accident in July 2013 in Lac-Mégantic, Quebec. A&nbsp;runaway oil train exploded, killing&nbsp;47 people, and subsequently MM&amp;A Railway and three employees, including the train’s engineer, were charged with criminal negligence (CBC News, 2014).</p> <p>In addition to freight management issues, a key rail safety concern is that of crossings. As recently as April 2014, Transport Canada had to issue orders for improved safety measures at crossings in suburban Ottawa after a signal malfunctioned in the area (CTV News, 2014a). According to Operation Lifesaver Canada (2014), in&nbsp;2011, there were 169 crossing collisions across Canada, with 25 fatalities and 21 serious injuries. In general, however,&nbsp;Canada’s&nbsp;73,000 kilometres&nbsp;of railway tracks safely transport both people and goods.&nbsp;And while railways in&nbsp;Canada, and elsewhere, are&nbsp;being forced to innovate, companies like Rocky Mountaineer (see Spotlight On above) give the industry glimmers of hope.</p> <p>The rail industry shares some common history with the cruise sector. Let’s now turn our focus&nbsp;to the water and learn about the evolution of&nbsp;travel on the high seas.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Mount-Stephen-House </li></ul></div> </div></div>

However, the industry as&nbsp;we know it began when&nbsp;Thomas Newcomen invented the&nbsp;steam engine in 1712. The first crossing of the Atlantic by steam engine took place in&nbsp;1819 aboard the SS <em>Savannah</em>, landing in Liverpool, England,&nbsp;after 29 days at sea. Forty years later,&nbsp;White Star Lines began building ocean liners including the&nbsp;<em>Olympic</em>-class ships&nbsp;(the <em>Olympic, Britannic</em>, and <em>Titanic</em>), expanding on previously utilitarian models by adding&nbsp;luxurious amenities (Briggs, 2008).</p> <p>A boom in passenger ship travel toward the end of the 1800s&nbsp;was aided by a growing influx of immigrants from Europe to America, while more affluent passengers travelled by&nbsp;steamship for pleasure or business. The industry grew over time but, like rail travel, began to decline after the&nbsp;arrival of airlines. Shipping companies were forced to change their business model from pure transportation to “an experience,” and the modern cruise industry was born.</p> <h1>The Cruise Sector</h1> <p>We’ve come a long way since the <em>Olympic</em> class of steamship. Today, the&nbsp;world’s largest cruise ship, MS&nbsp;<em>Oasis of the Seas</em>, has an outdoor park with 12,000 plants, an 82-foot zip wire, and a high-diving performance venue. It’s 20 storeys tall and can hold 5,606 passengers and a crew of up to 2,394 (Magrath, 2014). A crew on a cruise ship will include the captain, the chief officer (in charge of training and maintenance), staff captain, chief engineer, chief medical officer, and chief radio officer (communication, radar, and weather monitoring).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On:&nbsp;Cruise Lines International Association</strong></p> <p><strong>Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA)</strong> is the world’s largest cruise industry trade association with representation in North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Australasia. CLIA represents the interests of cruise lines and travel agents in the development of policy. CLIA is also engaged in travel agent training, research, and marketing communications (CLIA, 2014). For more information on CLIA, the cruise industry, and member cruise lines and travel agencies, visit&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.cruising.org/" data-url="http://www.cruising.org/">Cruise Lines International Association website</a>.</p> </div> <h2>Cruising the World</h2> <p>According to CLIA, 30 million passengers were expected to travel worldwide on 63 member lines in 2019. Projections for 2020 were 32 million passengers expected to cruise (CLIA, 2020). Given increased demand, 24 new ships were expected in 2014–15, adding a total capacity of over 37,000 passengers.</p> <p>Over 55% of the world’s cruise passengers are from&nbsp;North America, and the leading destinations (based on ship deployments), according to CLIA, are:</p> <ul><li>The Caribbean (37%)</li> <li>The Mediterranean (19%)</li> <li>Northern Europe (11%)</li> <li>Australia/New Zealand (6%)</li> <li>Alaska (5%)</li> <li>Asia (4%)</li> <li>South America (3%)</li> </ul> <h2>River Cruising</h2> <p>While mass cruises to destinations like the Caribbean remain incredibly popular, river cruises are emerging as another strong segment of the industry. The key differences between river cruises and ocean cruises are (Hill, 2013):</p> <ol><li>River cruise ships are smaller (400 feet long by 40 feet wide on average) and can navigate narrow passages.</li> <li>River cruises carry fewer passengers (about 10% of the average cruise, or 200 passengers total).</li> <li>Beer, wine, and high-end cuisine are generally offered in the standard package.</li> </ol> <p>The price point for river cruises is around the same as ocean trips, with the typical cost ranging from&nbsp;$2,000 to $4,000, depending on the itinerary, accommodations, and other amenities.</p> <p>From 2008 to 2013, river cruises saw a&nbsp;10% annual passenger increase. Europe leads the subcategory, while&nbsp;emerging destinations include a&nbsp;cruise route along China’s Yangtze River. As the on-board experience differs greatly from a larger cruise (no play areas, water parks, or on-board stage productions), the target demographic for river cruises is 50- to 70-year-olds. According to Torstein Hagen, founder and chairman of Viking,&nbsp;an international river cruising company, “with river cruises, a destination is the destination,”&nbsp;although many&nbsp;river cruises are themed around cultural or historical events (Hill, 2013).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1508" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1507" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany.jpg" alt="A river cruise ship." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/River-Beatrice-in-Passau-Germany-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2.6 Uniworld’s River Beatrice in Passau, Germany.</div></div> <h2>Cruising in Canada</h2> <p>According to a study completed for the North West &amp; Canada Cruise Association (NWCCA) and its partners, in 2012, approximately 1,100 cruise ship calls were made at Canadian cruise ports generating slightly more than 2 million passenger arrivals throughout the six-month cruise season (BREA, 2013). The&nbsp;study found three key cruise itineraries in Canada:</p> <ol><li>Canada/New England</li> <li>Quebec (between Montreal and Quebec City and US ports)</li> <li>Alaska (either departing from, or using, Vancouver&nbsp;or another BC city as a port of call)</li> </ol> <p>These generated $1.16 billion in direct spending. Cruising also generated almost 10,000 full- and part-time jobs paying $397 million in wages and salaries. The international cruise industry also generated an estimated $269 million in indirect business and income taxes in Canada, and the majority of this spending was in British Columbia (BREA, 2013).</p> <h2>Cruising in BC</h2> <p>BC’s rail history and cruise history are intertwined. As early as 1887, Canadian Pacific Railway began offering steamship passage&nbsp;to destinations such as Hawaii, Shanghai, Alaska, and Seattle. Ninety-nine&nbsp;years later,&nbsp;Vancouver’s Canada Place was built, with its cruise ship terminals, allowing the province&nbsp;to attract large ships and capture its share of the growing international cruise industry (Cruise BC, 2014).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Cruise BC</strong></p> <p><strong>Cruise BC</strong> is a partnership between BC port destinations designed to provide a vehicle for cooperative marketing and development of BC’s cruise sector.&nbsp;Their vision is that the&nbsp;West Coast and British Columbia’s coastal communities&nbsp;are recognized and sought out&nbsp;globally by cruise lines and passengers as&nbsp;a destination of choice. For more information, visit&nbsp;the Cruise BC website</p> </div> <p>This potential continues to grow as Nanaimo, Prince Rupert, Victoria, and Vancouver accounted for 57% of the Canadian cruise passenger traffic with 1.18 million passengers in 2012 (BREA, 2013).</p> <p>Cruising isn’t the only way for visitors to experience the waters of BC. In fact, the vast majority of our water travel is done by ferry. Let’s take a closer look at this vital component of BC’s transportation infrastructure.</p> <h1>Ferries</h1> <p>Ferry service in British Columbia&nbsp;dates back to the mid-1800s when the Hudson’s Bay Company ran ships&nbsp;between Vancouver Island and the Mainland. Later, CP Rail and Black Ball ferries ran a private service, until 1958 when&nbsp;Premier W.A.C. Bennett announced the BC&nbsp;Ferry Authority would consolidate&nbsp;the ferries under a provincial mandate.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1508" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1508" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island.jpg" alt="A ferry cruises the ocean." width="400" height="268" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island-300x201.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island-768x515.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island-225x151.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Spirit-of-Vancouver-Island-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 2.7 BC Ferries’ <em>Spirit of Vancouver Island</em>.</div></div> <p>The MV <em>Tsawwassen</em> and the MV <em>Sidney</em> began regular service on June 15, 1960, and BC Ferries was officially launched with two terminals and around 200 employees. Today, there are 37 vessels, 47 destinations, and more than 5,000 employees in the summer peak season (BC Ferries, 2019). In late 2019, BC Ferries introduced the world’s most advanced electric battery hybrid ferries to serve inter-island routes.</p> <p>BC isn’t the only destination where ferries make up part of the transportation&nbsp;experience. In 2011, <i>Travel + Leisure Magazine</i> profiled several notable ferry journeys in the article <a href="http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/worlds-most-beautiful-ferry-rides" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.travelandleisure.com/articles/worlds-most-beautiful-ferry-rides">“World’s Most Beautiful Ferry Rides,”</a> including:</p> <ul><li>An 800-mile&nbsp;ferry voyage through&nbsp;Chile’s&nbsp;Patagonian fjords</li> <li>A three-mile trip&nbsp;from the Egyptian Spice Market to Istanbul, Turkey</li> <li>Urban ferry rides including Hong Kong’s Victoria Harbour, Australia’s Sydney Harbour, and New York City’s Staten Island Ferry</li> </ul> <p>The article also featured the 15-hour trip from Port Hardy to Prince Rupert on British Columbia’s coast&nbsp;(Orcutt, 2011).</p> <p>While cruising is often a pleasant and relaxing experience, there are a number of safety concerns for vessels of all types.</p> <h1>Cruise and Ferry Safety</h1> <p>One of the major concerns on cruise lines is disease outbreak, specifically the norovirus (a stomach flu), which can spread quickly on cruise ships as passengers are so close together. <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/default.htm" data-url="http://www.cdc.gov/nceh/vsp/default.htm">The US Centers for Disease Control’s (CDC) vessel sanitation program</a> is designed to help the industry prevent and control the outset, and spreading, of these types of illnesses (Briggs, 2008).</p> <p>Accidents are also a concern. In 2006, the BC Ferries vessel MV <em>Queen of the North</em> crashed and sank in the&nbsp;Inside Passage, leaving two passengers missing and presumed dead. The ship’s navigating officer was charged with criminal negligence causing their deaths (Keller, 2013). More recently, a “hard landing” at Duke Point terminal&nbsp;on Vancouver Island&nbsp;caused over $4 million in damage. BC Ferries launched a suit against a German engineering firm in late 2013, alleging&nbsp;a piece of equipment failed, making a smooth docking impossible. The Transportation Safety Board found that staff aboard the ship didn’t follow proper docking procedures, however, which contributed&nbsp;to the crash (Canadian Press, 2013).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: The Transportation Safety Board&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The <strong>Transportation Safety Board (TSB)</strong> investigates&nbsp;marine, pipeline, rail, and air incidents.

For more information on one of the biggest trends in tourism, online travel agencies (<span class="glossary-term">OTAs</span>), and how online bookings&nbsp;impact the transportation sector, please see <a class="internal" href="#part-travel-services" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/travel-services/">Chapter 7</a>.</p> <h1>Fuel Cost</h1> <p>When it comes to moving people, fuel cost is critical. The cost of jet fuel is one of the single highest factors in airline profitability. In 2013, the average cost&nbsp;was&nbsp;around $125 per barrel, which was $5 less than the previous year (IATA, 2014a). Cruise ships consume a lower grade of diesel than do land vehicles, but they consume a lot of it. The <em>QE2</em>, for example, consumes roughly 380 tonnes of fuel every day if travelling at 28.5 knots&nbsp;(Briggs, 2008).</p> <h1>Labour</h1> <p>As in all tourism-related sectors, cyclical labour shortages can significantly impact the transportation industry. In the aviation sector, a forecast found that by 2032 the world’s airlines will need 460,000 additional pilots and 650,000 new maintenance technicians to service current and future aircraft. The drive to find employees also extends to the maritime sector, where the International Maritime Organization (IMO) launched a “Go to sea!” campaign to attract more workers to the field (PWC, 2012).</p> <h1>Environmental Impacts</h1> <p>In addition to fuel and labour costs, and regulations we’ve covered already, the transportation sector has a significant impact on the natural environment.</p> <h2>Air Impacts</h2> <p>According to the David Suzuki Foundation (2014), the aviation industry is responsible for 4% to 9% of climate change impacts, and greenhouse gas emissions from flights have risen 83% since 1990. Airline travel has a greater emissions impact than driving or taking the train per passenger kilometre, which caused&nbsp;a bishop in the UK to famously declare that “Making selfish choices such as flying on holiday [is]&nbsp;a symptom of sin” (Barrow, 2006).</p> <h2>Rail Impacts</h2> <p>Rail&nbsp;travel is widely regarded as one of the most environmentally friendly modes of&nbsp;transportation due to its low carbon dioxide emissions. Railways come under fire outside of the tourism realm, however, as freight shipping can produce hazards to resident health including an increased risk of developing cancer and noise pollution (The Impact Project, 2012).</p> <h2>Cruise Impacts</h2> <p>Cruise ships can generate significant pollution from black water (containing human waste), grey water (runoff from showers, dishwashers, sinks), bilge water (from the lowest compartment of the ship), solid waste (trash), and chemical waste (cleaners, solvents, oil). One ship can create almost a million litres&nbsp;of grey water, over&nbsp;113,000 litres&nbsp;of black water, and over 140,000 litres of bilge water every day. Depending on the regulations in the operating areas, ships can simply dump this waste directly into the ocean. Ballast tanks, filled to keep the ship afloat, can be contaminated with species which are then transported to other areas, disrupting sensitive ecosystems (Briggs, 2008).</p> <h2>Land Impacts</h2> <p>A recent study found that the impact of travel on land is highly dependent on the number of passengers. Whereas travelling alone in a large SUV&nbsp;can have high emissions per person (as high as flying), increasing the number of passengers, and using a smaller vehicle, can bring the impact down to that of train travel (<em>Science Daily</em>, 2013).</p> <p>For more information on the environmental impacts of the transportation sector, and how to mitigate these, read <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a>.</p> <h1>Weather</h1> <p>As you’ve learned, the transportation sector can have an effect on climate change, and changes in weather have a strong effect on transportation. According to Natural Resources Canada (2013), some of these include:</p> <ul><li>More drastic freeze-thaw cycles, destroying pavement and causing ruts in asphalt</li> <li>Increased precipitation causing landslides, washing out roads, and derailing trains</li> <li>Effects and costs of additional&nbsp;de-icing chemicals deployed on aircraft and runways (over 50 million litres were used worldwide in 2013)</li> <li>Delayed flights and sailings due to increased storm activity</li> <li>Millions of dollars of infrastructure&nbsp;upgrades required as sea levels increase and flood structures (replacing or relocating bridges, tunnels, ports, docks, dykes, helipads and airports)</li> </ul> <p>The threat of climate change could significantly impact sea-level airports such as YVR, and some 50 additional registered airports across Canada that sit at five metres or less above sea&nbsp;level (Natural Resources Canada, 2013).</p> <p>For this reason, it’s important that the sector continue to press for innovations and greener transportation choices, if only to ensure future financial costs are kept at bay.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1511" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1511" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009.jpg" alt="An airplane on a wet runway with lightning in the background." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Baltimore-Airport-June-2009-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1511">Figure 2.9 A flight grounded at Baltimore Airport due to severe weather.</div></div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Baltimore-Airport-June-2009 </li></ul></div> </div></div>

This section briefly explores these options.</p> <h1>Scenic and Sightseeing Travel</h1> <p>It’s common for visitors to want to explore a community and appreciate the sights. We’ve already learned a little about the rail-based sightseeing company, Rocky Mountaineer. Many destinations also offer short-term, hop-on-hop-off bus and trolley tours. Others feature trams and trolleys. Outside of impromptu&nbsp;excursions, sightseeing tours are often put together by inbound tour operators. You can learn more about tour operators, and the sightseeing sector, in <a class="internal" href="#part-travel-services" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/travel-services/">Chapter 7</a>.</p> <h1>Transit and Destination Infrastructure</h1> <p>Vancouver’s Tourism Master Plan acknowledges the importance of transportation infrastructure for the tourism industry. Priorities for future development by the city include (Tourism Vancouver, 2013):</p> <ul><li>Improving accessibility for people with disabilities</li> <li>Creating a transit loop between downtown attractions</li> <li>Supporting ferries in False Creek</li> <li>Providing late-night transit</li> <li>Investigating and implementing a public bike share</li> <li>Developing more transit options along the Broadway corridor</li> <li>Working with taxi companies to explore a strategic plan for taxi operations</li> <li>Enhancing walkability by implementing recommendations from the Pedestrian Safety Study and Action Plan</li> </ul> <p>These action items were developed in consultation with industry stakeholders as well as residents, and reflect the interrelated elements that make up&nbsp;a destination’s transportation infrastructure.</p> <h2>Rentals and Taxis</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1514" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1514" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1514" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Lincoln-Town-Car.jpg" alt="A silver car in a parking lot.

One of the reasons that brands have&nbsp;consolidated over time is the high fixed cost of operation as vehicles are purchased, maintained, and disposed of. Fierce competition means prices are checked and updated thousands of times a day. The business is also highly seasonal, with high traffic in summer and spring, and so fleet management is critical for profitability. Rental companies tend to use enplanements&nbsp;(the numbers of passengers travelling by air), as a measurement of market trends that influence rental usage&nbsp;(DBRS, 2010).</p> <h3>Taxis</h3> <p>In BC, taxi licences are issued by the BC Passenger Transportation Board. In Vancouver, the right to operate a taxi is based on a permit system, and each permit costs the original holder $100. But because of the limited number of permits available, those who hold one are able to auction it off for over&nbsp;$800,000 and keep the profit. As a result, passengers in Vancouver paid&nbsp;an average&nbsp;of 73% more for the equivalent trip in Washington, D.C. Drivers from&nbsp; areas outside the city depositing passengers in Vancouver are&nbsp;also not permitted to pick up fares on the return trip, having to drive across their boundaries (Proctor, 2014).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Ridesharing apps</span>like Uber, which allow people to find a ride using their mobile phone, have emerged to exert influence on car travel in key destinations. In most major cities where ridesharing is available, these apps have rapidly undercut the taxi industry. In SanFransico for example, according to the city’s transit authority, per month, trips by taxi have plummeted from 1,424 in 2012 to 504 in 2014, even though taxi operators maintain a monopoly over rides from the airport (Kuittinen, 2014). In New York City, however, the price of medallions (similar to Vancouver’s taxi permits) continues to hover above $950,000. In large markets like Manhattan, passengers continue to hail cabs on the street at the moment, with e-hails (electronic taxi hails) at 0.17% of the market (Brustein &amp; Winter, 2014). The City of Vancouver opted to force Uber to roll back after its initial release, and in 2014 placed the app on a six-month moratorium after pressure from taxi operators who cited threats to the values of their licences as well as safety and monitoring concerns (CTV News, 2014b). However, in January 2020, Uber and Lyft ride-hailing was launched in Vancouver. The Passenger Transportation Board announced on Jan. 23, 2020 that it had approved Uber’s application to operate in the Lower Mainland and Whistler, as soon as the company secures the appropriate insurance. Ride-hailing began in Vancouver shortly thereafter (Vancouver Sun, January 23, 2020). As well, the Passenger Transportation Board announced in early February 2020, that it had approved Kabu’s application to operate in the Lower Mainland, Whistler and the Greater Victoria area, as soon as the company secures the appropriate insurance. Kabu is based out of Richmond, B.C. and had been operating across the Greater Vancouver area since 2016 but paused operations in September 2019 when the company submitted its PTB application.</p> <p>Uber is available in hundreds of cities internationally so you may already be familiar with the app, or may even already have it downloaded to your phone. Uber offers a variety of vehicles, with UberX being the most affordable, standard sedan option all the way up to Select which includes more stylish rides. As this and other examples illustrate,&nbsp;the transportation sector is vulnerable to regulatory, technological, operational, and business trends. Let’s look at these in more detail.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Lincoln-Town-Car </li></ul></div> </div></div>

In 2012, Air North surpassed one million passengers carried. Employing over 200 people, the airline is owned in significant part by the Vuntut Development Corporation, the economic arm of the Vuntut Gwitchin First Nation (VGFN). In fact, one in 15 Yukoners owns a stake in the airline (Air North, 2015).</p> <p>The ownership model has meant that economic returns are not always the priority for shareholders. As stated on its website, “the maximization of profit is not the number one priority,” as air service is a “lifeline” to the VGFN community.

The history of Canada’s grand hotels is also the story of Canada’s ocean liners and railways. Until the&nbsp;use of personal cars became widespread in the 1920s and 1930s, and taxpayer-funded all-weather highways were created, railways were the only long-distance land transportation available in Canada.</p> <p>Both&nbsp;of Canada’s&nbsp;railway companies established hotel divisions: Canadian Pacific Hotels and Canadian National Hotels (Canada History, 2013). The first hotels were small and included Glacier House in Glacier National Park, BC, and Mount Stephen House in Field, BC. The hotel business was firmly established when both companies recognized the business opportunity in the growth of tourism, and they soon&nbsp;became rivals, building grand hotels in select locations close to railway stops.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Canadian Pacific Hotels</strong></p> <p>Under the guidance of Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) chief engineer and visionary William Cornelius Van Horne, a hotel empire was born (Canada History, 2013). Van Horne was a pioneer of tourism, and like Thomas Cook in the UK, he saw the potential for tourism that was made possible by the railway. Van Horne was famously quoted in 1886, “If we can’t export the scenery, we’ll import the tourists.” In 1999, many historic CPR properties joined the Fairmont brand when Canadian Pacific Resorts and Hotels bought the Fairmont Brand.

These hotels remain in operation today and are landmarks in their destinations, functioning as accommodations&nbsp;and as local attractions due to their historic significance and outstanding architecture.</p> <p>Through the 1950s and 1960s, an increase in motor traffic saw the rise of the <span class="glossary-term">motel</span>. The word <em>motel,</em> used less commonly today, comes from the term “motorist’s hotel,” used to denote a hotel that provides ample parking and rooms that are easily accessible from the parking lot. Traditionally, these structures were designed with all the rooms facing the parking lot, and relied heavily on motor traffic from nearby highways (Diffen, 2015).</p> <p>Today, there are a number of hotel types, which can be classified in multiple ways. Let’s explore these classifications in more detail.</p> <h1>Hotel Types</h1> <p>Hotels are typically referred to by <span class="glossary-term">hotel type</span> or category.

Budget hotels were first developed in the United States and built along the interstate highway system. The first Holiday Inn opened in the United States in 1952; the first&nbsp;Quality Motel followed in 1963.</p> <p>In Europe, Accor operates the predominant European-branded budget rooms. The Accor Economy brand includes: Breakfree, ibis, ibis Styles, ibis budget, greet, JO&amp;JOE and hotelF1. These budget brands offer comfort, modern design, and breakfast on site; ibis Styles is all inclusive, with one price for room night, breakfast, and internet access (Accor, 2020).</p> <p>The budget brands by Accor are an example of a shift toward the budget boutique hotel style. A relatively new category of hotel, budget boutique is a no-frills boutique experience that still provides style, comfort, and a unique atmosphere.</p> <h2>Boutique Hotels</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1529" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1524" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Magnolia-Hotel-2013.jpg" alt="A note reads, &amp;quot;Raul, Welcome back to The Magnolia!

These include having less than 100 rooms and featuring a distinctive design style and on-site food and beverage options (Boutique Hotel Association, n.d.). As a reflection of the size of the hotel, a boutique hotel is typically intimate and has an easily identifiable atmosphere, such as&nbsp;classic, luxurious, quirky, or funky.</p> <p>According to Bill Lewis, general manager for the Magnolia Hotel and Spa in Victoria “Boutique hotels are all about their smaller size, sense of style, and personalized nature.”&nbsp; He further notes that “the individual style of boutique hotels really provides a differentiated experience than that of the larger branded properties which have seen considerable consolidation in the last number of years.&nbsp; Our guests really appreciate this luxurious and intimate experience which our size and staffing levels allow us to achieve” (personal communication, 2020).</p> <h2>Resorts</h2> <p>A resort is a full-service hotel that provides access to or offers a range of recreation facilities and amenities. A resort is typically the primary provider of the guest experience and will generally have one signature amenity or attraction (Brey, 2009).</p> <p>Examples of signature amenities include skiing and mountains, golf, beach and ocean, lakeside, casino and gaming, all inclusiveness, spa and wellness, marina, tennis, and waterpark. In addition, resorts also offer secondary experiences and a leisure or retreat-style environment.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Condé Nast Best Hotels and Resorts in Canada<br /> </strong></p> <p><em>Condé Nast Traveler</em> has many well-regarded “best of” lists, one of which is the Best Hotels and Resorts in the US and Canada.

This section explains each of these in more detail and provides examples of each.</p> <h2>Independent</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1529" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1525" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel.jpg" alt="The entrance to a hotel restaurant called Bacchus, shaded by trees lining the street." width="400" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wedgewood-Hotel-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.5 The exterior of the Wedgewood Hotel in downtown Vancouver.</div></div> <p>An independent hotel is financed by one individual or a small group and is directly managed by its owners or third-party operators. The term <em>independent</em> refers to a management system that is free from outside control.</p> <p>There are a number of very well-established independently branded hotels. These hotel companies have developed their own standards, support systems, policies and procedures, and best practices in all areas of the business. Independent hotels have the flexibility to customize or adjust their systems to position their property for success, and the location, product, service, experience, sales and marketing, and brand are all necessary for that success (Cabañas, 2014). An example of an independent hotel is the Wedgewood Hotel and Spa in Vancouver, founded by Eleni Skalbania, and currently co-owned by her youngest daughter, Elpie Markinakis Jackson (Wedgewood, 2020).</p> <h2>Management Contract</h2> <p>Another business model is a management contract. This is a service offered by a management company to manage a hotel or resort for its owners. Owners have two main options for the structure of a management contract. One is to enter into a separate franchise agreement to secure a brand and then engage an independent third-party hotel management company to manage the hotel. SilverBirch Hotels is an example of a hotel management company that manages independent hotels and hotels operating under different major franchise brands, such as Marriott International (SilverBirch Hotels, 2020).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1529" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1526" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress.jpg" alt="A grand, old-style hotel with brick walls and gables." width="450" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress.jpg 1600w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-768x511.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Empress-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.6 The iconic Fairmont Empress Hotel, purchased in 2014 by Nat and Flora Bosa.</div></div> <p>A slightly different&nbsp;option is for owners to select a single company to provide the brand and the expertise to manage the property. Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and Fairmont Hotels and Resorts are companies that provide this option to owners. In 2014, the iconic&nbsp;Fairmont Empress hotel was purchased by Vancouver developer Nat Bosa and his wife Flora, who continued to retain Fairmont as the management company after the purchase (Meiszner, 2014).</p> <p>Selecting a brand affiliation is one of the most significant decisions hotel owners must make (Crandell, Dickinson, &amp; Kante, 2004). The brand affiliation selected will largely determine the cost of hotel development or conversion of an existing property to meet new brand standards. The affiliation will also determine a number of things about the ongoing operation including the level of services and amenities offered, cost of operation, marketing opportunities or restrictions, and the competitive position in the marketplace. For these reasons, owners typically consider several branding options before choosing to operate independently or selecting a brand affiliation.</p> <h2>Chains and Franchise Agreements</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1529" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1527" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel.jpg" alt="A hotel room with a large bed, an armchair, a chaise, and a large window overlooking the ocean." width="450" height="272" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel.jpg 2047w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-300x181.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-1024x619.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-768x464.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-1536x928.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-65x39.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-225x136.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Coast-Bastion-Hotel-350x212.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.7 A room at the Coast Bastion Hotel in Nanaimo.</div></div> <p>Another managerial and ownership structure is franchising. A hotel <span class="glossary-term">franchise</span> enables individuals or investment companies (the <span class="glossary-term">franchisee</span>) to build or purchase a hotel and then buy or lease a brand name to operate a business and become part of a chain of hotels using the <span class="glossary-term">franchisor</span>’s hotel brand, image, goodwill, procedures, controls, marketing, and reservations systems (Rushmore,&nbsp;2005).</p> <p>A well-known franchise in BC is Coast Hotels. A franchisee with Coast Hotels becomes part of a network of properties that use a central reservations system with access to electronic distribution channels, regional and national marketing programs, central purchasing, and brand operating standards (Coast Hotels, 2020). A franchisee also receives training, support, and advice from the franchisor and must adhere to regular inspections, audits, and reporting requirements.</p> <p>Selecting a franchise structure may reduce investment risk by enabling the franchisee to associate with an established hotel company. Franchise fees can be substantial and a franchisee must be willing to adhere to the contractual obligations with the franchisor (Migdal, n.d.; and Rushmore,&nbsp;2005).&nbsp; Franchise fees typically include an initial fee paid with the franchise application, and then continuing fees paid during the term of the agreement. These fees are sometimes a percentage of revenue but can be set at a fixed fee. Franchise fees generally range from 4% to 7% of gross rooms revenue (Crandell et al.,&nbsp;2004).</p> <h2>Fractional Ownership</h2> <p>In a <span class="glossary-term">fractional ownership</span> model, developers finance hotel builds by selling units in one-eighth to one-quarter shares. This financing model was very popular in BC from the late 1990s to 2008 (Western Investor, 2012).&nbsp;Examples of fractional ownership include the <a href="https://www.sunpeaksresort.com/" data-url="https://www.sunpeaksresort.com/">Sun Peaks Ski Resort</a> in Kamloops and the <a href="https://www.pentictonlakesideresort.com/" data-url="https://www.pentictonlakesideresort.com/">Penticton Lakeside Resort</a>.</p> <p>In this model, owners have an ownership interest, owning a ‘fraction’ of the unit they purchased.&nbsp; Owners can place their unit in a rental pool. The investment return for owners is based on the term of the contract they have for their unit, the strata fees, and the hotel’s occupancy. Managing fractional ownership can be very time consuming for hotel owners or management companies as each hotel unit can have up to eight owners. If occupancy rates are too low, an owner may not be able to cover the monthly strata fees. For the hotel management company, attaining occupancy rate targets is necessary to ensure that the balance of revenue is sufficient to cover the hotel’s operating expenses.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1529" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1528" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort.jpg" alt="A large hotel at the bottom of a ski hill in winter." width="450" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Sun-Peaks-Resort-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.8 The Sun Peaks Resort hotel.</div></div> <p>Developers now anticipate that fractional ownership will not be used to finance new hotel builds in the future due to poor performance.

If the hotel costs $125,000 per [room], the room has to rent for $125 per night on average and you need 60% to 70% occupancy to break even” (McDonald, 2011).</p> <p>Several terms and formulas&nbsp;are used to evaluate revenue management strategies and operational efficiency:</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Occupancy</span> is a term that refers to the&nbsp;percentage of all guest rooms in the hotel that are occupied at a given time.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Average daily rate (ADR)</span> is a calculation&nbsp;that states the&nbsp;average guest room income per occupied room in a given time period. It is determined by dividing the total room revenue by the number of rooms sold.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Revenue per available room (RevPAR)</span> is&nbsp;a calculation that combines both occupancy and ADR in one metric. It&nbsp;is calculated by multiplying a hotel’s ADR by its occupancy rate. It may also be calculated by dividing a hotel’s total room&nbsp;revenue by the total number of available rooms and the number of days in the period being measured.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Costs per occupied room (COPR)</span> is a figure that states all the costs associated with making a room ready for a guest (linens, cleaning costs, guest amenities).</p> <p>These terms and measurements allow hotel staff and management to track the success of the operation and to compare against competitors and regional averages.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Regardless of their role in the operation, all employees must do their part to ensure&nbsp;that each guest’s needs, preferences, and expectations are met and satisfied.</p> <p>In some cases, such as in a luxury hotel, resort hotel, or an all-inclusive property, the guest services may represent a person’s entire vacation experience. In other cases, the service might be less significant, for example, in a budget airport hotel where location is the key driver, or a campground where guests primarily expect to take care of themselves.</p> <p>In all cases,&nbsp;operators and employees must recognize and understand guest expectations and also what drives their&nbsp;satisfaction and loyalty. When the key drivers of guest satisfaction are understood, the hotel can ensure that service standards and business practices and policies support employees to deliver on these needs and that guest expectations are satisfied or exceeded.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: 4Hoteliers</strong></p> <p>4Hoteliers&nbsp;compiles world news for hotel, travel, and hospitality professionals.

Division heads oversee various departments including managers, administrative staff, and line-level supervisors. The general manager’s role is to provide strategic leadership and planning to all departments so revenue is maximized, employee relations are strong, and guests are satisfied.</p> <p>The director of operations is responsible for overseeing the food and beverage and rooms division. This role is also responsible for providing guidance to department heads to achieve their targets and for directing the day-to-day operations of their respective departments. The director of operations also assumes the responsibilities of the general manager when he or she is absent from the property.</p> <h1>Accounting</h1> <p>The controller is responsible for overall accounting and finance-related activities including accounts receivable, accounts payable, payroll, credit, systems management, cash management, food and beverage cost control, receiving, purchasing, food stores, yield management, capital planning, and budgeting.</p> <h1>Engineering and Maintenance</h1> <p>The chief engineer is the lead for the effective operation and maintenance of the property on a day-to-day basis, typically including general maintenance, heating, ventilation and air conditioning, kitchen maintenance, carpentry, and electrical and plumbing (Fairmont Hotels and Resorts, 2020). The chief engineer is also responsible for preventive maintenance and resource management programs.</p> <h1>Food and Beverage Division</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1537" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1536" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver.jpg" alt="A woman in a bathrobe sips coffee at a small breakfast table next to a huge window." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Scott-and-Tina-Visit-the-Pan-Pacific-Vancouver-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.12 A guest enjoys breakfast in her room at the Pan Pacific Hotel in Vancouver.</div></div> <p>The food and beverage director is responsible for catering and events, in-room dining, and stand-alone restaurants and bars. The executive chef, the director of banquets, and the assistant managers responsible for each restaurant report to the director of food and beverage. The director assists with promotions and sales, the annual food and beverage budget, and all other aspects of food and beverage operations to continually improve service and maximize profitability.</p> <h1>Human Resources</h1> <p>The human resources department provides guidance and advice on a wide range of management-related practices including recruitment and selection, training and development, employee relations, rewards and recognition, performance management, diversity and inclusion and health and safety.</p> <h1>Rooms Division</h1> <h2>Front Office</h2> <p>Reporting to the director of rooms, the front office manager, sometimes called the reception manager,&nbsp;controls the availability of rooms and the day-to-day functions of the front office. The front desk agent reports to the front office manager and works in the lobby or reception area to welcome the guests to the property, process arrivals and departures, coordinate room assignments and pre-arrivals, and respond to guest requests.</p> <h2>Housekeeping</h2> <p>Reporting to the director of rooms, the executive housekeeper manages and oversees housekeeping operations and staff including the housekeeping manager, supervisor, house persons, and room attendants. An executive housekeeper is responsible for implementing the operating procedures and standards. He or she also plans, coordinates, and schedules the housekeeping staff. Room audits and inspections are completed regularly to ensure standards are met (go2HR, 2020a).</p> <p>Reporting to the housekeeping supervisor, room attendants complete the day-to-day task of cleaning rooms based on standard operating procedures and respond to guest requests. Reporting to the housekeeping supervisor, house persons clean public areas including hallways, the lobby, and public restrooms, and deliver laundry and linens to guest rooms.</p> <h2>Reservations</h2> <p>Large full-service hotels typically have a reservations department, and the reservations manager reports directly to the front office manager. The guest’s experience starts with the first interaction a guest has with a property, often during the reservation process. Reservations agents convert calls to sales by offering the guest the opportunity to not only make a room reservation but also book other amenities and activities.</p> <p>Today, with online and website reservations available to guests, there is still a role for the reservations agent, as some guests prefer the one-to-one connection with another person. The extent to which the reservations agent position is resourced will vary depending on the hotel’s target market and business strategy.</p> <h1>Sales and Marketing</h1> <p>The sales and marketing director is responsible for establishing sales and marketing activities that maximize the hotel’s revenues. This is typically accomplished by increasing occupancy and revenue opportunities for the hotel’s accommodation, conference and catering space, leisure facilities, and food and beverage outlets. The sales and marketing manager is responsible for coordinating marketing and promotional activities and works closely with other hotel departments to ensure customers are satisfied with all aspects of their experience (go2HR, 2020b).</p> <h1>Catering and Conference Services</h1> <p>In larger full-service hotels with conference space, a hotel will have a dedicated catering and conference services department. The director of this department typically reports to the director of sales and marketing. The catering and conference services department coordinates all events held in the hotel or catered off-site. Catering and conference events and services range from small business meetings to high-profile conferences and weddings.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1537" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1537" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus.jpg" alt="A chef sets plates of gourmet food onto the passthrough in a busy kitchen." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cafe-Pacifica-Restaurant-2013-Winter-Menus-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.13 The culinary team at Café Pacifica in the Pan Pacific prepares food for a special event.</div></div> <p>Now that we have a sense of the building blocks of a typical hotel operation, let’s look at some trends affecting the sector.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Businesses must be flexible to meet the needs of their different markets and evolving trends.&nbsp;These trends affect all hotel types, regions, and destinations differently. However, overall, hoteliers must respond to these trends in a business landscape that is increasingly competitive, particularly in markets where the supply base is growing faster than demand (<em>Hotelier</em>, 2018).&nbsp; As the digital revolution continues to change the way we work and spend our free time, hoteliers are adapting to respond to what guests expect in their interactions with a hotel, from the booking experience right through to leaving guest reviews and sharing their experience with others.</p> <h1>The Sharing Economy: Airbnb</h1> <p><a href="https://www.airbnb.ca" data-url="https://www.airbnb.ca">Airbnb</a> began in 2008 when the founders rented their air mattresses to three visitors in San Francisco (Fast Company, 2012). In fact, the name Airbnb is derived from “air mattress bed and breakfast.” However, Airbnb is not only for couch surfers or budget-conscious travellers; it includes a wide range of spaces in locations all over the world. Since 2008, the Airbnb online marketplace has grown rapidly.&nbsp; In 2014 Airbnb had more than 1 million listings worldwide and 30 million guests who used the service (Melloy, 2015). By 2019, Airbnb was widely considered the world’s largest lodging brand reporting over 7 million listings worldwide, in 100,000 cities, in over 220 countries (Airbnb, 2020).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1541" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1540" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb.jpg" alt="Hands hold a smartphone with the Airbnb app open." width="450" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Airbnb-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1541">Figure 3.14 Airbnb has transformed the short-term rental industry.</div></div> <p>This and other innovations have changed the accommodation landscape as never before. Ten to 15 years ago online travel agents were a major innovation that changed the distribution and sale of rooms. But they still had to work with existing hotels, whereas Airbnb has enabled new entrants into the industry and thus increased supply.</p> <p>On the supply side, Airbnb enables individuals to share their spare space for rent; on the demand side, consumers using Airbnb benefit from increased competition and more choice. In 2008, an unanswered question was to what extent Airbnb would impact the hospitality industry and tourism destinations. A study completed in 2014 in Austin, Texas, indicated that lower-end hotels, and hotels not catering to business travellers, were more vulnerable to increased competition from rentals enabled by firms like Airbnb than were hotels without these characteristics (Zervas, Preserpio, &amp; Byers, 2015).</p> <p>Airbnb is an example of a shift to the sharing economy, an economic model in which people rent beds, cars, boats, and other underutilized assets directly from each other, all coordinated via the internet (<em>The</em> <em>Economist</em>, 2013). Airbnb is the most prominent example of this model. It provides a platform for travellers and manages all aspects of the relationship using digital platforms that include the Airbnb app, mobile and website.</p> <p>When hosts create an account, they set the price and write the descriptions to advertise the space to guests (Airbnb, 2020). At Airbnb, the host who rents out the space controls the price, the description of the space, and the guest experience. The host also makes the house rules and has full control over who books the space.&nbsp; Airbnb provides the digital platforms for all aspects of the host and guest interaction and for these services charges hosts a 3.5% service fee. As well, both hosts and guests can rate each other and write reviews (Airbnb, 2020).</p> <p>One criticism of Airbnb from the hospitality industry is that Airbnb does not follow the same operating regulations as those required for hotels.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another comes from homeowners in apartment complexes who object to neighbours repeatedly renting out their homes to short-term Airbnb guests. Airbnb rentals have also created pressure on the rental housing marketing in popular tourism destinations leading to less long-term rental inventory and higher rental prices.</p> <p>In February, 2018, the BC provincial government and Airbnb reached an agreement that Airbnb would collect municipal (MRDT) and provincial (PST) taxes, and remit these to the province generating a reported $42.9 million for 2018 (CBC, 2018).</p> <h1>Distribution and Online Travel Agents</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Online travel agents (OTAs)</span> are a valuable marketing and third-party distribution resource for hotels and play a significant role in online distribution (Inversini &amp; Masiero, 2014).&nbsp; In 2020, OTAs (for example, Expedia, Hotels.com, Kayak.com) had a 24% share of transient reservations in North American markets.</p> <p>OTAs offer global distribution so that each hotel and chain can be available to anyone. Smaller independent hotels that do not have the global marketing and sales resources of a larger chain are able to gain exposure, sell rooms, and build their reputation through online guest ratings and reviews. OTAs also help hotels offer combined value and packaging options that are attractive to many consumers (for example, booking and search options for hotels, car rentals, air fare, attractions, and travel packages). Customized searches, travel guidance, and rewards points are also available when booking through an OTA. If a hotel or chain has an exceptional product and service, OTAs share guest ratings, which can increase the number of reservations and referrals.</p> <p>The general industry guidance for hotels using OTAs is to ensure that this distribution channel is part of a broader sales strategy, coupled with sound customer relationship management practices.&nbsp; Some large chains have also improved supplier direct bookings. In 2016, Hilton launched a loyalty program and a book direct campaign “Stop clicking around” (TravelClick, n.d.).&nbsp; Commissions for OTAs are in the region of 15% and hoteliers will continue to advance their capabilities to offer online supplier direct bookings (TravelClick, n.d.). This will require investment in streamlined apps and improved mobile sites to simplify and improve the user experience and booking process (Berelowitz, 2018).</p> <p>Table 3.3 provides an overview of some of the distribution channels that are available to hoteliers.</p> <table style="width: 100%;"><caption>Table 3.3 Distribution channels and benefits</caption> <thead><tr><td style="text-align: center;" colspan="2"><a class="internal" href="#table3.4" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/3-trends-and-issues/#table3.4">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr><th scope="col">Distribution Channel</th> <th scope="col">Benefits</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>Hotel website or brand website (e.g., HotelName.com)</td> <td><ul><li>Consumers prefer to book directly with the property</li> <li>Instills&nbsp;consumers with the trust to book</li> <li>Reduces or eliminates booking fees</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr><td>Online travel agent (OTA)</td> <td><ul><li>Generates a&nbsp;billboard effect</li> <li>Works well when&nbsp;OTAs are the most&nbsp;relevant channel to the hotel’s target market</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr><td>Central reservations office (CRO)</td> <td><ul><li>Centralised reservation requests by phone</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr><td>Global distribution system (travel agents)</td> <td><ul><li>Increases exposure to bookings through travel agents</li> <li>Helps capture&nbsp;consumers who continue to use traditional channels</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr><td>Direct to the hotel</td> <td><ul><li>Walk-ins</li> <li>Phone reservations</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id="table3.4">For more on marketing in the services sector, see <a class="internal" href="#part-services-marketing" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/services-marketing/">Chapter 8</a>.</p> <h1>Mobile Devices &amp; Smart Technologies</h1> <p>Mobile devices have placed everything at our fingertips.&nbsp; Guest are booking stays on their smart phones and the traditional touch points in hotels are changing.&nbsp; Guests are looking for ‘frictionless’ check in and check out, digital locking systems and ‘smart’ automated energy saving devices. Smart technology can now not only improve guest experiences but also reduce operational costs.&nbsp; For example, with smart reserved parking, hotels can use smart sensors and hotel apps to give guests the choice of reserving their parking space in advance of their arrival, reducing the cost of operating a manual parking inventory (Attala, 2019).</p> <p>No longer seeking the same ‘touch points’ the hotel and lodging industry must continue to find ways to connect with their guests through mobile devices, touch screens, voice activated technologies and more.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1541" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1541" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Waiting-at-baggage-claim-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.15 A group of travellers on their mobile phones at baggage claim in an airport.</div></div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Airbnb </li><li>Waiting-at-baggage-claim </li></ul></div> </div></div>

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-food-and-beverage-sector-performance" title="4.1 Food and Beverage Sector Performance"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">18</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">4.1 Food and Beverage Sector Performance</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>According to Statistics Canada, the <span class="glossary-term">food and beverage</span> sector comprises “establishments primarily engaged in preparing meals, snacks and beverages, to customer order, for immediate consumption on and off the premises” (Government of Canada, 2012). This sector is commonly known to tourism professionals by its initials as <span class="glossary-term">F&amp;B</span>.</p> <p>The food and beverage sector grew out of simple origins: as people travelled from their homes, going about their business, they often had a need or desire to eat or drink. Others were encouraged to meet this demand&nbsp;by&nbsp;supplying food and drink. As the interests&nbsp;of the public became&nbsp;more diverse, so too did the offerings of the food and beverage sector.</p> <p>In 2014, Canadian food and beverage businesses accounted for 1.1 million employees and more than 88,000 locations across the country with an estimated $71 billion in sales, representing around 4% of the country’s overall economic activity. Many students are familiar with the sector through their workplace, because Canada’s restaurants provide one in every five youth jobs in the country — with 22% of Canadians starting their career in a restaurant or foodservice business. Furthermore, going out to a restaurant is the number one preferred activity for spending time with family and friends (Restaurants Canada, 2014a).</p> <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">For a perspective on how sales are distributed across the country by province, and how different foodservice operations perform in terms of </span><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="glossary-term">revenue</span> (sales dollars collected from guests), look at Tables 4.1 and 4.2. A&nbsp; key factor in the below results is the higher population base in Ontario and Quebec. Economic growth or decline also impacts results and vary from province to province year over year.</span></p> <p id="table4.2"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">In terms of sales (Table 4.2), Ontario is the leader with almost $28 billion. Quebec, BC, and Alberta occupy the next three spots with revenues ranging from $9 billion to $13 billion, and the other provinces had sales of $2 billion apiece or less. </span>Over the last five years, BC has shown greater growth in revenues along with third more units (restaurants) than neighbouring Alberta, leading to identical average sales per unit.</p> <p>Foodservice sales in British Columbia rose by a solid 7.9% in 2018 over 2017. Alberta boasts the highest average unit volume at $838,666 per year, more than $100,000 over the national average due to greater disposable income and no provincial sales tax on meals. In BC, improved economic growth lifted total foodservice sales by a healthy 7.9% for the strongest annual growth since 2006 (Restaurants Canada, 2019). Since 2018 Alberta has seen a significant decline in its economy due to the energy sector collapse tied to the price of crude oil.</p> <table style="width: 100%; height: 269px;"><caption>Table 4.1 Performance by province for commercial foodservice — units</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 99.9274%; text-align: center;" colspan="3"><a class="internal" href="#table4.1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/food-and-beverage-sector-performance/#table4.1">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><th style="height: 64px; width: 35.3154%;" rowspan="2">Province</th> <th style="height: 64px; width: 32.0522%;" rowspan="2">Foodservice Units Totals</th> <th style="height: 64px; width: 32.5598%;" rowspan="2">Average Volume/Unit ($)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Newfoundland and Labrador</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">1,168</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">737,301</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Prince Edward Island</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">413</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">663,259</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 29px;"><td style="height: 29px; width: 35.3154%;">Nova Scotia</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 32.0522%;">2,260</td> <td style="height: 29px; width: 32.5598%;">750,458</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">New Brunswick</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">1,708</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">714,521</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Quebec</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">22,736</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">594,147</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Ontario</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">38,317</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">747,468</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Manitoba</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">2,621</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">794,425</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Saskatchewan</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">2,673</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">717,449</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Alberta</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">11,277</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">838,666</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">British Columbia</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">14,550</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">838,444</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td style="height: 16px; width: 35.3154%;">Canada</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.0522%;">97,939</td> <td style="height: 16px; width: 32.5598%;">735,915</td> </tr> <tr style="height: 16px;"><td class="source" style="height: 16px; width: 99.9274%;" colspan="3">Data source: Statistics Canada, Restaurants Canada 2019</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>Table 4.2 below indicates the profit margins per province. <span class="glossary-term">Profit</span> is the amount left when expenses (including corporate income tax) are subtracted from sales revenue.

The following sections explore the types of food service operations in Canada.</p> <p>There are two key distinctions: <span class="glossary-term">commercial foodservice</span>, which comprises&nbsp;operations whose primary business is food and beverage, and <span class="glossary-term">non-commercial foodservice</span>&nbsp;establishments where food and beverages are served but are not the primary business.</p> <p>Let’s start with the largest segment of F&amp;B operations, the commercial sector.</p> <h1>Commercial&nbsp;Operators</h1> <p>Commercial operators make up the largest segment of F&amp;B in Canada with just over 80% market share (Restaurants Canada, 2019). It is made up of quick-service restaurants, full-service restaurants, catering, and drinking establishments. Let’s look at each of these in more detail.</p> <h2>Quick-Service Restaurants</h2> <p>Formerly known as fast-food restaurants, <span class="glossary-term">quick-service restaurants</span>, or QSRs, makeup 44.4% of total food sales in Canada (Restaurants Canada, 2019). This prominent portion of the food sector generally caters to both residents and visitors and is represented in areas that are conveniently accessed by both. Brands, chains, and franchises dominate the QSR landscape. While the sector has made steps to move away from the traditional fast-food image and style of service, it is still dominated by both fast food and food fast; in other words, food that is prepared and purchased quickly, and generally consumed quickly.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The First McDonald’s In Canada</strong></p> <p>The first McDonald’s restaurant in Canada opened in Richmond, BC, in 1967. Located on No. 3 Road, it featured a sleek almost space-age design. To see a picture of the location, visit&nbsp;<a href="http://www.richmond.ca/cityhall/archives/exhibits/thenandnow/then_now_set_7.htm" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.richmond.ca/cityhall/archives/exhibits/thenandnow/then_now_set_7.htm">McDonald’s: Then and Now</a>.</p> </div> <p>Convenience and familiarity are key in this sector. Examples of <span class="glossary-term">QSRs</span> include:</p> <ul><li>Drive-through locations</li> <li>Stand-alone locations</li> <li>Locations within retail stores</li> <li>Kiosk locations in shopping centres</li> <li>High-traffic areas, such as major highways or commuter routes</li> </ul> <h2>Full-Service Restaurants</h2> <p>With 44.2% of the market share (Restaurants Canada, 2019), <span class="glossary-term">full-service restaurants</span> are perhaps the most fluid of the F&amp;B operation types, adjusting and changing to the demands of the marketplace. Consumer expectations are higher here than with QSRs (Parsa, Lord, Putrevu, &amp; Kreeger, 2015). The menus offered are varied, but in general, reflect the image of the restaurant or consumer’s desired experience. Major segments include fine dining, family/casual, ethnic, and upscale casual.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1551" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova.jpg" alt="A dessert of pink ice cream served on top of strawberries, rhubarb, and meringue." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-768x513.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/North-Arm-Farm-Strawberry-Rhubarb-Pavlova-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.2 A rhubarb pavlova with local Pemberton strawberries is served at Araxi Restaurant + Bar, a fine dining establishment in Whistler.</div></div> <p><span class="glossary-term">Fine dining restaurants</span> are characterized by highly trained chefs preparing complex food items, exquisitely presented. Meals are brought to the table by experienced servers with sound food and beverage knowledge in an upscale atmosphere. The concept of fine dining has evolved over the years.&nbsp; It was once mandatory to have table linens, fine china, crystal stemware, and silver-plate cutlery in order to be referred to as a fine dining establishment. Service was often very formal and reserved with minimal personal interaction between guests and servers. The table was often embellished with fresh flowers and candles as well. Today the best restaurants focus on the quality of preparation, presentation, and flavor of the food utilizing the best and where possible local ingredients. Servers who are engaged, customer-centric, and well informed are sought after by the best restaurants.</p> <p>In British Columbia, many of the finest restaurants feature wine lists heavily showcasing British Columbia food and wine. Tablescapes are kept simple, with excellent quality flatware and stemware and minimal fuss with centerpieces and generally no linen tablecloths.</p> <p>In these businesses, the <span class="glossary-term">average cheque</span>, which is the total sales divided by the number of guests served, is quite high (often reviewed with the cost symbols of three or four dollar signs- $ $ $ or $ $ $ $).</p> <p>Bishop’s in Vancouver is one of BC’s best known and longest operating fine dining restaurants. Since opening in 1985, this 45-seat restaurant has served heads of state including Bill Clinton and Boris Yeltsin and has won awards including the Best of Vancouver.

These operations offer affordable menu items that span a variety of customer tastes. They also have the operational flexibility in menu and restaurant layout to welcome large groups of diners. An analysis of menus in family/casual restaurants reveals a high degree of operational techniques such as menu item <span class="glossary-term">cross-utilization</span>, where a few key ingredients are repurposed in several ways. Service is often very casual and friendly. Both chain and independent restaurant operators flourish in this sector. Popular chain examples in BC include White Spot, Ricky’s All Day Grill, Boston Pizza, and The Old Spaghetti Factory. Independents include the Red Wagon Café in Vancouver, the Bon Voyage Restaurant near Prince George, and John’s Place in Victoria.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1552" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory.jpg" alt="Restaurant interior with many stained glass windows and stained glass light fixtures." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/The-Old-Spaghetti-Factory-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.3 The interior of the Old Spaghetti Factory, a popular family chain, in Gastown, Vancouver.

The growth and changing nature of this sector reflect the acceptance of various ethnic foods within our communities. Ethnic restaurants generally evolve along two routes: toward remaining authentic to the cuisine of the country of origin, or toward larger market acceptance through modifying menu items (Mak, Lumbers, Eves, &amp; Chang, 2012).&nbsp; Food is often the medium for this sense of belonging (Koc &amp; Welsh, 2001; Laroche, Kim, Tomiuk, &amp; Belisle, 2005). The authenticity of the experience often drives the customer’s decision.&nbsp; The driving force behind these operations is the Chef’s background, their commitment to the quality of the product, innovative preparation mixed with exceptional technique, and knowledgeable service staff to bring it to the consumer.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The 38 Essential Vancouver Restaurants<br /> </strong></p> <p>Vancouver is widely regarded as one of the great food cities of the world, peppered with exceptional restaurants lead by outstanding Chefs.

Consumers began to want the experience of a fun social evening at a restaurant with good value (but not cheap), in contrast to the perceived stuffiness of fine dining at that time. These restaurants are typically dinner houses, but they may open for lunch or brunch depending on location. Examples in BC include the Keg, Earls, Cactus Club, Brown’s Social House, and Joey Restaurants. A closer examination of popular restaurant menus will show many items suitable for sharing amongst groups of people. Family style sharing platters that are passed back and forth between multiple diners. This adds to the desire for patrons to feel relaxed and comfortable while dining out with family or friends.</p> <h2>Catering and Banqueting</h2> <p>Catering makes up only 7.9% of the total share of F&amp;B in Canada (Restaurants Canada, 2019) and comprises food served by catering companies at banquets and special events at a diverse set of venues. Note that <em>banqueting</em> pertains to catered food served on-premise, while <em>catering</em> typically refers to off-premise service. At a catered event, customers typically eat at the same time, as opposed to restaurant customers who are served individually or in small groups. The catering and banqueting experience has evolved tremendously to the point where guests who attend events expect restaurant-quality food and service. In keeping with this concept, the event planner will coordinate with the catering establishments that guests who attend the planned events have a choice of options for each course served. While surcharges may apply to meals because of the option choices the expectation is every bit as high from the customer.</p> <p>Catering businesses (whether on-site or at special locations) are challenged by the episodic nature of events and the issues of food handling and food safety with large groups. Catering businesses include:</p> <ul><li>Catering companies</li> <li>Conference centres</li> <li>Conference hotels</li> <li>Wedding venues</li> <li>Festival food coordinators</li> </ul> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Diner en Blanc</strong></p> <p>An interesting public event with a dining focus is Diner en Blanc, which is held in cities around the globe including Vancouver and Victoria. The Vancouver event has been running since 2011. The original concept was developed in Paris in 1988. Diners wear all white and bring their table, chair, and place settings with them to a secret location announced only hours before. Participants have the option to bring their own food or purchase a catered meal. Alcoholic beverages are also available for purchase on-site.</p> <p>For more information, visit the <a href="https://vancouver.dinerenblanc.com/" data-url="https://vancouver.dinerenblanc.com/">Dîner en Blanc website</a>.</p> </div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-2503" src="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/introtourismedits/wp-content/uploads/sites/980/2020/04/Dîner-en-Blanc-Vancouver-2012.jpg#fixme#fixme#fixme" alt="Hundreds of people dressed all in white dine outdoors at small tables crowded together." width="500" height="333" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.5 Dîner en Blanc Vancouver’s first event at Jack Poole Plaza.</div></div> <p>While beverages make up part of almost every dining experience, some establishments are founded on beverage sales. Let’s look at these operations next.</p> <h2>Alcohol and Cannabis</h2> <p>With a 3.5% market share (Restaurants Canada, 2019), the drinking establishment sector comprises bars, wine bars, cabarets, nightclubs, and pubs.&nbsp;&nbsp;In British Columbia, all businesses and premises selling alcohol must adhere to the BC Liquor Control and Licensing Act. At the time this chapter was written, significant changes were taking place in the regulations governing drinking establishments, but some general conditions have remained stable.</p> <p>In BC, liquor licenses are divided into <span class="glossary-term">liquor primary</span> and <span class="glossary-term">food primary</span>. As the name suggests, a liquor primary license is needed to operate a business that is in the primary business of selling alcohol. Most pubs, nightclubs, and cabarets fall into this category. A food primary license is required for an operation whose primary business is serving food. Some operations, such as pubs, will hold a liquor primary license even though they serve a significant volume of food. In this case, the license allows for diverse patronage.</p> <p>One noteworthy change to the licensing of pubs in BC is that children are permitted in them if they are&nbsp;accompanied and attended by responsible adults.&nbsp;While not universally adopted by pubs to date, this change in legislation is an&nbsp;example of the fluctuating&nbsp;social norms to which the sector must respond.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1554" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile.jpg" alt="Front of a Tudor-style pub." width="450" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile.jpg 1600w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Six-Mile-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.6 The Six Mile Pub in Victoria.

The Cannabis Act is in place to regulate such activities. In the 2019 Chef Survey Results conducted by Restaurants Canada Cannabis/CBD infused drinks ranked #1 and Cannabis/CBD infused food ranked #2 as the items Chef’s felt would be the next big thing in the restaurant business (Restaurants Canada, 2019).</p> <div class="textbox shaded">The Cannabis Act was put into place on October 17th, 2018.

Now let’s look at the other 20% of businesses, which fall under the non-commercial umbrella.</p> <h1>Non-Commercial</h1> <p>The following non-commercial entities earn just under 20% share of the foodservice earnings in Canada (Restaurants Canada, 2019b). While these make up a smaller share of the market, there are some advantages inherent in these business models. Non-commercial operations cater predominantly to consumers with limited selection or choice given their occupation or location. This type of consumer is often referred to as a <span class="glossary-term">captured patron</span>. In a tourism capacity such as in airports or on cruise ships, the accepted price point for these patrons is often higher for a given product, increasing profit margins.</p> <h2>Institutional</h2> <p>Often run under a predetermined contract, this sector includes:</p> <ul><li>Hospitals</li> <li>Universities, colleges, and other educational institutions</li> <li>Prisons and other detention facilities</li> <li>Corporate staff cafeterias</li> <li>Cruise ships</li> <li>Airports and other transportation terminals and operations</li> </ul> <h2>Accommodation Foodservice</h2> <p>These include hotel restaurants and bars, room service, and self-serve dining operations (such as a breakfast room).&nbsp; Hotel restaurants are usually open to the public and reliant on this public patronage in addition to business from hotel guests. Collaborations between hotel chains and restaurant chains have seen the reliable pairing of hotels and restaurants, such as the combination of Sandman Hotels and Moxie’s Grill and Bar.</p> <h2>Vending and Automated Foodservices</h2> <p>While not&nbsp;generally viewed as part of the food and beverage sector, automated and vending services do account for significant sales for both small and large foodservice and&nbsp;accommodation providers. Vending machines are located in motels, hotels, transportation terminals, sporting venues, or just about any location that will allow for the opportunity for an impulse or convenient purchase.</p> <h1>Business Performance for Types of Food and Beverage Operators</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1555" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1555" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Market-Share-by-Restaurant-Segment.jpg" alt="Market share by restaurant segment.

Figure 4.9 illustrates the difference between the share of traffic and the share of dollars for each sub sector. We know that QSRs are much more economical and generally much busier than full-service restaurants. How do that traffic and low prices translate into market share for the different segments?</p> <p>Figure 4.9 shows that QSRs attract two-thirds of all the traffic while earning less than half of the total dollars. Family/midscale and casual dining each attract half the dollars of QSR, but they do that from much lower shares of the traffic. Meanwhile, fine dining is patronized by less than 1% of the total restaurant traffic but earns 4.2% of the dollars. The growing force of convenience stores, department stores, and other retail establishments obtain a respectable 11.5% of traffic and 10.6% of the restaurant dollar.</p> <p>As you can see, while QSRs attract the greatest number of guests, the ratio of dollars earned per transaction is significantly less than that of the fine-dining sector. This makes sense, of course, because the typical QSR earns relatively little per guest but attracts hundreds of customers, while a fine dining restaurant charges high prices and serves a select few guests each day.</p> <h2>Sales Per Segment</h2> <table style="width: 100%;"><caption>Table 4.3a Commercial sector sales and market shares for 2017–2018</caption> <thead><tr><td style="text-align: center;" colspan="5"><a class="internal" href="#table4.3b" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/types-of-food-and-beverage-providers/#table4.3b">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr><th scope="col">Type of Restaurant</th> <th scope="col">2017 Final ($ millions)</th> <th scope="col">Segment Market Share (%)</th> <th scope="col">2018 Projected ($ millions)</th> <th scope="col">Segment Market Share (%)</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><th scope="row">QSR</th> <td>30,464.2</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>32,027.8</td> <td>44.4</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row">Full-service</th> <td>30,206.0</td> <td>44.1</td> <td>31,863.3</td> <td>44.2</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row">Caterers</th> <td>5,400.5</td> <td>7.8</td> <td>5,688.2</td> <td>7.9</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row">Drinking Places</th> <td>2,438.5</td> <td>3.5</td> <td>2,495.5</td> <td>3.5</td> </tr> <tr><th scope="row">Total Commercial</th> <td>$68,509.2</td> <td>N/A</td> <td>$72,074.8</td> <td>N/A</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table id="table4.3b" style="width: 100%;"><caption>Table 4.3b Non-commercial sector sales and market shares for 2017–2018</caption> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 149.25px; text-align: center;" colspan="5"><a class="internal" href="#table4.3" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/types-of-food-and-beverage-providers/#table4.3">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="col">Type of Restaurant</th> <th style="width: 132.133px;" scope="col">2017 Final ($ millions)</th> <th style="width: 157.533px;" scope="col">Segment Market Share (%)</th> <th style="width: 153.833px;" scope="col">2018 Projected ($ millions)</th> <th style="width: 166.583px;" scope="col">Segment Market Share (%)</th> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="row">Accommodation</th> <td style="width: 132.133px;">6,934.0</td> <td style="width: 157.533px;">40.8</td> <td style="width: 153.833px;">7,508.0</td> <td style="width: 166.583px;">40.5</td> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="row">Institutional</th> <td style="width: 132.133px;">4,735.0</td> <td style="width: 157.533px;">27.9</td> <td style="width: 153.833px;">5,125.0</td> <td style="width: 166.583px;">27.6</td> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="row">Retail</th> <td style="width: 132.133px;">2,569.9</td> <td style="width: 157.533px;">15.1</td> <td style="width: 153.833px;">2,936.3</td> <td style="width: 166.583px;">15.8</td> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="row">Other</th> <td style="width: 132.133px;">2,748.6</td> <td style="width: 157.533px;">16.2</td> <td style="width: 153.833px;">2,972.9</td> <td style="width: 166.583px;">16</td> </tr> <tr><th style="width: 149.25px;" scope="row">Total Non-Commercial</th> <td style="width: 132.133px;">$16,987.5</td> <td style="width: 157.533px;">N/A</td> <td style="width: 153.833px;">$18,542.2</td> <td style="width: 166.583px;">N/A</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id="table4.3">The sales revenues for the various segments&nbsp;are shown in Table&nbsp;4.3.&nbsp;Note that QSRs and full-service restaurants are almost equal in their sales and almost completely dwarf the other commercial sectors of caterers and drinking places.

The first way to classify customers is to divide them into two key markets: residents and visitors.</p> <p>The first of these, the resident group, can be further divided based on their&nbsp;purpose for&nbsp;visiting an F&amp;B operator. &nbsp;For one group, food or drink is the primary purpose for the visit. For example, think of a group of friends getting together at a local&nbsp;restaurant to experience their signature sandwich. For another group, food and drink is the&nbsp;secondary purpose, added spontaneously or as an ancillary activity.&nbsp;For example, think of time-crunched&nbsp;parents whisking their kids through a drive-through on their way from one after-school activity&nbsp;to the next. Here the&nbsp;food and beverage providers offer an&nbsp;expedient way to access a meal.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1558" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1558" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1558" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete.jpg" alt="" width="450" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Life-goal-5-complete-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1558">Figure 4.8 A visitor to Nanaimo eats a signature “Nanaimo bar” in front of a Nanaimo bar, the Jingle Pot Pub.</div></div> <p>Foodservice providers also service the visitor market, which&nbsp;presents unique challenges as guests will bring with them the tastes and eating habits of their home country or region.&nbsp;Most establishments&nbsp;generally follow one of two directions. One is to cater completely to visitors from the day the doors&nbsp;open, with an&nbsp;operational and market focus on tourists. The other is to cater primarily to residents.</p> <p>Sometimes a&nbsp;local foodservice provider&nbsp;can continue&nbsp;to cater to the resident market over time. In other cases, often because of financial pressures, the business shifts its focus away from the&nbsp;residents&nbsp;to better cater to&nbsp;visitors’ tastes. These changes, when they do occur, generally happen over time and can lead to questions of authenticity of the local offerings (Smart,&nbsp;2003; Heroux,&nbsp;2002;&nbsp;Mak, Lumbers, Eves, &amp; Chang, 2012).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The Science of Addictive Food&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>For some time, one secret recipe for success in the food sector, particularly the fast-food portion of the sector, was simple: salt, sugar, and fat — and lots of it. There is a science behind these additives and why consumers keep coming back to satisfy their cravings. To view a CBC special on the science of addictive food, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cpdb78pWl4" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cpdb78pWl4"><i>The Science of Addictive Food</i></a>.</p> </div> <p>It is clear that the food and beverage sector must remain responsive to consumers’ needs and desires. This is made evident by the emergence of health-concious eating in North America over the last two decades. The influence of books such as <em>Fast Food Nation</em>&nbsp;(Schlosser, 2012) and documentaries such as <em>Super Size Me</em>&nbsp;have created mainstream awareness about what goes into our food and our bodies. As many developed nations, including&nbsp;Canada, struggle with health-care concerns including hypertension, diabetes, and obesity, food operators are taking note and developing new health-conscious&nbsp;menus. Programs like BC’s Informed Dining initiative are helping consumers understand their options (see the Spotlight On below).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Informed Dining</strong></p> <p>The Informed Dining program was created by Healthy Families BC to help consumers gain a better understanding of the ingredients in their food and their role in daily healthy eating habits and guidelines. For more information, visit&nbsp;the <a href="https://www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca/home/informed-dining-health-care-facilities" data-url="https://www.healthyfamiliesbc.ca/home/informed-dining-health-care-facilities">Informed Dining web page</a>.</p> </div> <p>This awareness, coupled with an increasing interest and desire for more authentic&nbsp;foods produced without using herbicides and pesticides, free of genetically modified ingredients, and even free of carbohydrates or gluten, has placed pressure on the sector to respond, and many have (Frash, DiPietro, &amp; Smith, 2014). Consumers are more aware of the plight of farmers and producers from faraway places and the support for&nbsp;fair trade practices. At the same time, there is&nbsp;a heightened desire for more locally grown products, and a general awareness of nutrition and the quality of products that are harvested in season and closer to home.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Cittaslow Designation for Cowichan Bay</strong></p> <p>The community of Cowichan Bay on Vancouver Island was awarded the Cittaslow Designation, which helps acknowledge its focus on sustainable practices and local food harvesting best practice. For more information on the designation and community efforts, watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ-Cnh-v5Q" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JQ-Cnh-v5Q">Cittaslow Cowichan Bay</a>.</p> </div> <p>Consumer consciousness regarding the source and distribution of food has created a movement that champions sustainable and locally grown foods.&nbsp;While this trend does have its extremes, it is founded on the premise that eating food that has been produced nearby&nbsp;leads to better food quality, sustainable food production processes, and increased enjoyment. This has led to a number of restaurants that incorporate these concepts in their menu planning and marketing.</p> <p>In addition to this trend toward “conscious consumerism” (LinkBC, 2014, p.4), F&amp;B professionals must be highly aware of the importance of special diets including gluten-free, low-carb, and other dietary restrictions (LinkBC, 2014).</p> <p>All of these influences are continuously shaping the food and beverage sector. Before we explore additional trends and issues in the sector, let’s review the core considerations for profitability in foodservice operations.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1558" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-740" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program.jpg#fixme#fixme" alt="People smile around fresh produce and a sign saying &amp;quot;BC Association of Farmers' Markets.&amp;quot;" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program.jpg 2047w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/New-funding-for-farmers’-market-program-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.9 Officials announce more funding for B.C. farmers’ markets, which have become increasingly popular due to changing consumer tastes.</div></div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Life-goal-5-complete </li><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/14868822381/in/photolist-oDUASz-onFHYt-P9UPcQ-fEsKPs-P9UPGC-S6aEeZ-PjrJvy-S3yyEL-S6aAPT-PjrK11-P9UPyb-S3yKYs-S7d5Zj-S6aJm6-S3yzXL-RpyB6w-S7d729-ShhBri-SCpuZh-RpyA3Q-RpyzHG-ShhLn4-yGSZD7-ShhER4-ShhFFk-RGxapC-SuHJXV-SCpxXS-SCpGqJ-SCpz7A-SuHMTK-SuHRok-Rs4vWx-ShhHSV" data-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/14868822381/in/photolist-oDUASz-onFHYt-P9UPcQ-fEsKPs-P9UPGC-S6aEeZ-PjrJvy-S3yyEL-S6aAPT-PjrK11-P9UPyb-S3yKYs-S7d5Zj-S6aJm6-S3yzXL-RpyB6w-S7d729-ShhBri-SCpuZh-RpyA3Q-RpyzHG-ShhLn4-yGSZD7-ShhER4-ShhFFk-RGxapC-SuHJXV-SCpxXS-SCpGqJ-SCpz7A-SuHMTK-SuHRok-Rs4vWx-ShhHSV">New funding for farmers’ market program</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/" data-url="https://www.flickr.com/photos/bcgovphotos/">Province of British Columbia</a> is licensed under a <a rel="license" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/">CC BY-NC-ND (Attribution NonCommercial NoDerivatives)</a> license</li></ul></div> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-4-operations" title="4.4 Operations"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">21</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">4.4 Operations</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h1>Profitability</h1> <p>While many factors influence the profitability of foodservice operations, key considerations include type of business, location, cost control, and profit margin, sales and marketing strategies, and human resources management. We’ve already examined the different types of operations and their relative profit margins. Let’s look at the other profitability considerations in more detail.</p> <p>Key statistics show that operating revenues grew by 31% nationally from 2012 to 2017. Conversely, operating expenses rose by 31%, during the same period. The average pre-tax profit in 2017 was $30,370 or 4.3% of operating revenue. By many industry standards, this is a dangerously low profit as a percentage of revenues. Any number of situations could easily erode this profit including rent increases, unexpected maintenance repairs, and increased taxes. The cost of goods and the minimum wage increases were contributing factors in impacting operating expenses in all regions of the country. Economic slowdowns in Alberta and Newfoundland, directly linked to the Energy Sector were major contributors to substandard growth in these two provinces.</p> <p>Full-service restaurants remain the least profitable category of food service on average. Caterers remain the most profitable sector with a pre-tax profit margin of 7.2% nationally, despite having the highest labor costs as a percentage of operating revenue (Restaurants Canada, 2019).</p> <h2>Location</h2> <p>The selection of the correct location for a restaurant is often cited as the most critical factor in an operation’s success (or failure) in terms of profitability. Prior to opening, site analysis is required to determine the amount of traffic (foot traffic and vehicle traffic), proximity to competing businesses, visibility to patrons, accessibility, and presence (or absence) of desired patrons (Ontario Restaurant News, 1995).</p> <h2>Cost Control</h2> <p>According to Restaurants Canada, QSRs have the highest profit margin at 5.1%, while full-service restaurants have a margin of 3.5%. There will be significant variances from these percentages at individual locations even within the same brand (2014b).</p> <p>A number of costs influence the profitability of a food and beverage operation. Key operating expenses in the restaurant business <span class="glossary-term">food cost </span> are food cost, beverage cos<span style="background-color: #ffffff;">t </span><span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="glossary-term">beverage costs</span> </span></span>and payroll. These are commonly known as prime costs. Managing the prime costs <span style="background-color: #ffff00;"><span style="background-color: #ffffff;"><span class="glossary-term">primary costs</span>.&nbsp;</span></span> <span style="background-color: #ffffff;">to an appropriate and agreed upon level is critical to the success of any operation. Other expenses include property rental, utilities,</span> maintenance costs, advertising, legal fees, insurance and depreciation of equipment <span class="glossary-term">assets</span>. In addition to these big-ticket items, there is the cost of reusable products <span class="glossary-term">operating supplies</span> such as&nbsp;cutlery, glassware, china, and linen in full-service restaurants. The percentages of expenses to revenue will vary greatly by sector, location, and province.</p> <p>Given that most operations have both a service side (interacting directly with the consumer) and the production side (preparing food or drink to be consumed), the primary costs incurred during these activities often determine the feasibility or success of the operation. This is especially true as the main product (e.g., food and drink) is perishable; ordering the correct amount requires skill and experience. Managing your inventory once on site is of equal importance.</p> <h1>Sales and Marketing</h1> <p>The two principal considerations for sales and marketing in this sector are market share and revenue maximization. Most F&amp;B operations are constrained by finite time and space, so management must constantly seek ways to increase revenue from the existing operation or increase the share of the available market. Examples of revenue maximization include upselling existing consumers (e.g., asking if they want fries with their meal; offering dessert, specialty drinks pre and post-dinner), and using outdoor or patio space (even using rain covers and heaters to extend the outdoor season). Examples of increasing market share in the fast-food sector include extending special offers to new, first-time customers through social media or targeted direct mail.</p> <p>In today’s cluttered marketplace, being noticed is a constant goal for most companies. Converting that awareness into patronage is a challenge for most operators. Restaurant reviews have been a part of the food and beverage sector for a long time. With the increase of online reviews by customers at sites like Yelp, Urbanspoon, and TripAdvisor, and sharing of experiences via social media, operators are becoming increasingly aware of their web presence (Kwok &amp; Yu, 2013). For this reason, all major food and beverage operators carefully monitor their online reputation and their social media presence.</p> <blockquote><p>The digital marketplace for food is creating a world of ways to drive incremental business while leveraging fixed costs and creating new ways for restaurateurs to think out of the box about their business.<br /> —Dan Park, General Manager and Head of Uber Eats Canada (Restaurants Canada Food Service Facts 2019)</p></blockquote> <p>One of the keys to a strong reputation, both in-person and online, is the management of human resources.</p> <h1>Staffing and Human Resources</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1561" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1561" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1561" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cactus-Club-Cafe-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1561">Figure 4.10 Winner of Top Chef Canada Matthew Stowe and patron at a new Cactus Club restaurant opening.</div></div> <p>Appropriately staffing an food and beverage operation involves attracting the right people, hiring them, training them, and then assigning them to the right tasks for their skills and abilities. Many businesses operate outside the traditional work-week hours; indeed, some operate on a 24-hour schedule. Creating the right team, employing them in accordance with legal guidelines, and keeping up with the demands of the businesses are challenges that can be addressed by a well-thought-out and implemented human resources plan.</p> <p>People who have long-lasting careers&nbsp;in the sector find the fluctuating conditions appealing; no two days are the same, and the fast-paced and energetic social environment can be motivating.&nbsp;Many positions provide meaningful rewards and compensation that can lead to long-term careers.</p> <p>One topic of discussion in food and beverage human resources is that of gratuities (tipping). In Canada, restaurants are obligated to pay staff minimum wage, and gratuities are paid by the customer as an expression of their gratitude for service. This is not the model in countries like Australia, where service staff is paid a higher professional wage and prices are raised to accommodate this.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Tipping and Its Alternatives</strong></p> <p>In 2008, Michael Lynn and Glenn Withiam wrote a paper discussing the role of tipping and potential alternatives. While the paper focuses particularly on the United States (where wages are structured differently from Canada), it raises some good questions about consumer preference and impact on businesses (Lynn &amp; Withiam, 2008). For instance, do tips actually improve service? These questions can apply to food and beverage businesses but also other tourism operations within the service context. It also offers some suggestions for further research. Read the paper <a href="http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=articles" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://scholarship.sha.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&amp;context=articles">Tipping and Its Alternatives [PDF]</a>.</p> </div> <p>In British Columbia, tips are considered income for tax purposes but are not considered wages as they are not paid by the employer to the employee. A restaurant owner cannot use tips to cover business expenses (e.g., require an employee to use his or her tips to cover the cost of broken glassware). Employers are also not permitted to charge staff for the cost of diners who do not pay (known as a <span class="glossary-term">dine-and-dash</span>). They can, however, require front-of-house staff pool their gratuities, or pay individually, to ensure back-of-house staff receives <span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">a percentage of the tips (British Columbia Ministry of Jobs, Tourism and Skills Training, n.d.). This is also commonly known as a </span><span class="glossary-term">tip-out</span><span style="text-align: initial; font-size: 14pt;">.</span></p> <p>The Ministry of Labour’s website explains what constitutes a tip pool: “A tip pool is a collection of employees’ tips that is redistributed among some or all of the employer’s employees. This includes tip outs, which are payments from one employee to other employees because it is required by their employer’s policy. An employer may withhold, make a deduction or require an employee to give them a portion of their tips and other gratuities if the amount that is collected will be redistributed as part of a tip pool.” However, employers are prohibited from sharing in the tip pool (Restaurants Canada, 2019).</p> <p>There have been experiments with gratuity models in recent years. One example is a restaurant on Vancouver Island, which tried an all-inclusive pricing model upon opening in 2014 but reverted three months later to the traditional tipping model due to consumer demand and resistance to higher prices (Duffy, 2014). While many in the industry would prefer to operate with a no-tip policy, the consumers are not prepared to pay the higher menu price required to facilitate the process.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Cactus-Club-Cafe </li></ul></div> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-slug-4-trends-and-issues" title="4.5 Trends and Issues"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">22</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">4.5 Trends and Issues</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>In addition to having to focus on the changing needs of guests and the specific challenges of their own businesses, food and beverage operators must deal with trends and issues that affect the entire industry.&nbsp;Let’s take a closer look at these.</p> <h2>Industry Influencers</h2> <ul><li>Plant-based diets, healthy options</li> <li>Sustainable practices</li> <li>Evolution of home delivery</li> <li>Government influence</li> <li>Health and safety</li> <li>The power of technology</li> <li>Changing venues</li> </ul> <h2>Plant-Based Diets, Healthy Options</h2> <p>Plant-based diets are neither trend nor fad, they are viable, sustainable dietary options based on environmental practices, well being, nutrition, and personal choice.</p> <blockquote><p>For a combination of environmental, ethical, and health reasons plant-based foods have surged in popularity in Canada. A study by Dalhousie University found that 6.4 million Canadians are following a diet that either limits animal products intake (often termed flexitarian), or eliminates it altogether (Restaurants Canada, 2019).</p></blockquote> <p>The desire for plant-based foods will continue to grow driven by concern for the environment. Further proof of this is the number of quick-service restaurants now featuring plant-based products on their menus.</p> <h2>Sustainable Practices</h2> <p>In hand with plant-based diets is the continued drive to reduce our impact on the environment, through recycling, composting, donating leftover food, or water and energy conservation. In a survey of Restaurants Canada’s members, 80% said that environmental practices are important to the success of their businesses.</p> <blockquote><p>When incorporating environmental practices into your business, the planet is only one of the beneficiaries. When we are talking about sustainability we’re essentially talking about reducing-energy, water, waste-which also means lower operating costs and keeping dollars in your pocket.<br /> —Janine Windsor, President Leaders in Environmentally Accountable Foodservice (Restaurants Canada 2019 Food Service Facts)</p></blockquote> <h2>Evolution of Home Delivery</h2> <p>The mention of home food delivery ten years ago would have been about pizza delivery and Asian food. Arguably the hottest trend in foodservice has nothing to do with ingredients or regional cuisine. Instead, it’s the explosive growth of in-home delivery. Consumers are demanding variety and selection and delivery apps give them access to their favourite restaurants at home.</p> <blockquote><p>Delivery foodservice sales by digital (online and mobile apps) or traditional telephone totalled more than $4.3 billion in 2018, a staggering 44% increase over 2017 (Restaurants Canada).</p></blockquote> <p>While the popularity and accessibility of home delivery from your favourite restaurant has grown tremendously not all operators are enthusiastic over this growth. Many say home delivery has impacted the number of guests in their restaurants, which makes sense. The main concern lies with the profitability, with the majority believing the profit margin is slight. Regardless operators will need to figure out how to make this work and give the consumer what they want.</p> <h3>Examples of home delivery options:</h3> <ul><li>Skip the Dishes</li> <li>Hello Fresh</li> <li>Chef’s Plate</li> <li>makegoodfood.ca</li> </ul> <h1>Government Influence</h1> <p>Each level of government affects the sector in different ways.&nbsp;The federal government and its agencies have influence through&nbsp;income tax rates, costs of employee benefits (e.g., employer share of Canada Pension Plan and Employment Insurance deductions), and support for specific agricultural producers such as Canadian dairy and poultry&nbsp;farmers, which can lead to an increase in the price of ingredients such as milk, cheese, butter, eggs, and chicken compared to US prices (Findlay, 2014; Chapman, 1994).</p> <p>Provincial governments also impact the food and beverage sector, in particular with respect to employment standards; minimum wage; sales taxes (except Alberta); liquor, wine, and beer wholesale pricing (Smith, 2015); and corporate income tax rates.</p> <p>Municipal governments have&nbsp;an ever-increasing impact through property and business taxes, non-smoking bylaws, zoning and bylaw restrictions, user fees, and operating hours restrictions.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Restaurants Canada</strong></p> <p>When Restaurants Canada was founded in 1944, it was&nbsp;known as the&nbsp;Canadian Restaurant Association, and later the Canadian Restaurant and Foodservices Association.

In doing so, all food and beverage operators must adhere to standardized public safety regulations. Each province has regulations and legislation that apply in their jurisdiction. In BC, this is addressed by the FoodSafe and Serving It Right programs, and compliance with the Occupiers Liability Act. These regulations and legislation are enacted in the interest of public health and safety.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Health and Safety Training</strong></p> <p>Food and beverage professionals are strongly encouraged to take both FoodSafe and Serving It Right courses. These certifications are necessary to advance into specific and leadership roles in the industry. For instance, Serving It Right is required by all licensees, managers, sales staff, and servers in licensed establishments. In addition, individuals may require Serving It Right for a special occasion license.

Serving It Right is a mandatory course that is completed through self-study and is required for anyone serving alcohol in a commercial setting. Its goal is to ensure that licensees, managers, and servers know their legal responsibilities and understand techniques to prevent over-service and related issues (go2HR, 2014).</p> <p>In broad terms, BC’s Occupiers Liability Act covers the&nbsp;responsibilities of the occupier of a property to ensure the safety of visitors.&nbsp;Additional local health bylaws set standards of operation for health and safety under the direction of the medical officers of health. Public health inspectors regularly visit food and beverage operations to evaluate compliance. In some communities, these inspection results are posted online.</p> <p>Collectively, the food and beverage industry in BC has an excellent reputation for ensuring the health and safety of its patrons, the general public, and its employees.</p> <h1>The Power of Technology</h1> <p>Technology continues to play an ever-increasing role in the sector. It is most noticeable&nbsp;in QSRs where many functions are automated in both the <span class="glossary-term">front of house</span>&nbsp;and <span class="glossary-term">back of house</span>. In the kitchen, temperature sensors and alarms determine when fries are ready and notify kitchen staff. Out front, remote printers or special screens ensure the kitchen is immediately notified when a server rings in a purchase. WiFi enables credit/debit card hand-held devices to be brought directly to the table to process transactions, saving steps back to the serving station.</p> <blockquote><p>Canadians are interacting with restaurants using their smartphones and tablets in a variety of ways.

Many attribute the emergence of these spaces to the popularity of coffee shops such as Starbucks. In the third space, operators must create a comfortable venue for customers to “hang out” with comfortable seating, grab and go F&amp;B options, WiFi, and a relaxed ambience. Providing these components has been shown as a way to increase traffic and customer loyalty (Mogelonski, 2014).</p> <h2>Taking It to the Street</h2> <p>Street food has always been a component of the foodservice industry in most big cities. These operations are often run by a single owner/operator or with minimal staff and serve hot food that can be eaten while standing. According to research firm IBISWorld, in 2011 the “street food business — which includes mobile food trucks and nonmechanized carts, is a $1 billion industry that has seen an 8.4 percent growth rate from 2007 to 2012” (<em>Entrepreneur,</em> 2011) with 78% of owners having no more than four employees.</p> <p>Recently, in North America, where climate and weather allow, there has been a noticeable increase in both the number and type of street food vendors. In the city of Vancouver alone there are over 100 permitted food cart businesses, searchable by an app and sortable list — and the city uses the terms <em>street</em> <em>food vendor</em>, <em>food cart</em>, and <em>food truck</em> interchangeably (City of Vancouver, 2014).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1565" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1565" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day.jpg" alt="Dozens of people lined up to patronize food trucks on a busy city street." width="500" height="375" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.12 Tacofino (closest), Pig on the Street, and Mom’s Grilled Cheese food trucks welcome crowds to their portable kitchens in downtown Vancouver.</div></div> <p><span class="glossary-term">Pop-up restaurants</span> have also emerged, facilitated in part by the prevalent use of social media for marketing and location identification. Pop-ups are temporary restaurants with a known expiry date, which also tend to have the following in common (Knox, 2011):</p> <ul><li>A well-known or up-and-coming chef at the helm</li> <li>An interesting, but stationary, location (a warehouse, a park, the more unusual the better)</li> <li>Staff who are adept at promotion and word-of-mouth</li> <li>Strong local <span class="glossary-term">foodie</span> (food and beverage enthusiast) population-based in the area</li> <li>Involvement from local artists or musicians to add to the experience</li> </ul> <p>As popular they are with consumers, the ways in which pop-ups deviate from restaurants has aggravated some critics, causing <em>Bon Appétit</em> magazine to declare that “pop-ups are not supposed to be restaurants,” and that “pop-up restaurants are over” (Duckor, 2013). Statements like these are further evidence that food and beverage services trends are dynamic and ever-changing.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Must-Wash-Hands </li><li>Vancouver-food-carts-on-a-sunny-day </li></ul></div> </div></div>

While the claim has not been verified, it certainly rings true for a number of F&amp;B professionals who have experienced this phenomenon. The story is as follows: A busy New York City restaurant kept getting bad reviews for slow service, so they hired a firm to investigate. When they compared footage from 2004 to footage from 2014, they made some pretty startling discoveries. So shocking, in fact, that they ranted about it in an anonymous post on Craigslist:</p> <blockquote><div><p>We are a popular restaurant for both locals and tourists alike. Having been in business for many years, we noticed that although the number of customers we serve on a daily basis is almost the same as ten&nbsp;years ago, the service seems very&nbsp;slow. One of the most common complaints on review sites against us and many restaurants in the area is that the service was slow and/or they needed to wait too long for a table. We’ve added more staff and cut back on the menu items but we just haven’t been able to figure it out.</p> <p>We hired&nbsp;a firm to help us solve this mystery, and naturally the first thing they blamed it on was the employees needing more training and the kitchen staff not being up to the task of serving that many customers.</p> <p>Like most restaurants in NYC we have a surveillance system, and unlike today where it’s digital, 10 years ago we still used special high capacity tapes to record all activity. At any given time we had 4 special Sony systems recording multiple cameras. We would store the footage for 90 days just in case we needed it for something.</p> <p>The investigators&nbsp;suggested we locate some of the older tapes and analyze how the staff behaved ten&nbsp;years ago versus how they behave now. We went down to our storage room but we couldn’t find any tapes at all.</p> <p>We did find the recording devices, and luckily for us, each device has 1 tape in it that we simply never removed when we upgraded to the new digital system!</p> <p>The date stamp on the old footage was Thursday July 1, 2004. The restaurant was very busy that day. We loaded up the footage on a large monitor, and next to it on a separate monitor loaded up the footage of Thursday July 3 2014, with roughly the same amount of customers as ten years before.</p> <p>We carefully looked at over 45 transactions in order to determine what has been happening:</p> <p><strong>Here’s a typical transaction from 2004:</strong></p> <p>Customers walk in.&nbsp;They are&nbsp;seated and are given menus. Out of 45 customers 3&nbsp;request to be seated elsewhere.</p> <p>Customers spend 8 minutes on average before closing the menu to show they are ready to order.</p> <p>Waiters shows up almost instantly and takes the order.</p> <p>Appetizers are fired within 6 minutes; obviously the more complex items take longer.</p> <p>Out of 45 customers 2 sent their&nbsp;items back.</p> <p>Waiters keep an eye on&nbsp;their tables so they can respond quickly if the customer needs something.</p> <p>After guests are done, the check is delivered, and within 5 minutes they leave.</p> <p>Average time from start to finish: 1 hour, 5 minutes.</p> <p><strong>Here’s what happened in 2014:</strong></p> <p>Customers walk in.&nbsp;Customers get seated and are given menus, and out of 45 customers 18 request to be seated elsewhere.</p> <p>Before even opening the menu most customers&nbsp;take their phones out, some are taking photos while others are texting or browsing.</p> <p>Seven of the 45 customers had waiters come over right away, they showed them something on their phone and spent an average of five minutes of the waiter’s time. Given this is recent footage, we asked the waiters about this and they explained those customers had a problem connecting to the WIFI and demanded the waiters try to help them.</p> <p>After a few minutes of letting the customers review the menu,&nbsp;waiters return&nbsp;to their tables. The majority of customers have not even opened their menus and ask the waiter to wait a bit.</p> <p>When customers do&nbsp;open their menus, many place&nbsp;their phones on top and continue using their activities.</p> <p>Waiters return to see if they are ready to order or have any questions. Most&nbsp;customers ask for more time.</p> <p>Finally a table is ready to order.&nbsp;Total average time from when a&nbsp;customer is&nbsp;seated until they place their order is 21 minutes.</p> <p>Food starts getting delivered within 6 minutes; obviously the more complex items take way longer.</p> <p>26 out of 45 customers spend an average of 3 minutes taking photos of the food.</p> <p>14 out of 45 customers take pictures of each other with the food in front of them or as they are eating the food. This takes on average another 4 minutes as they must review and sometimes retake the photo.</p> <p>9 out of 45 customers sent their food back to reheat. Obviously if they didn’t pause to do whatever on their phone the food wouldn’t have gotten cold.</p> <p>27 out of 45 customers asked their waiter to take a group photo. 14 of those requested the waiter retake the photo as they were not pleased with the first photo. On average this entire process between the chit chatting and reviewing the photo taken added another 5 minutes and obviously caused the waiter not to be able to take care of other tables he/she was serving.</p> <p>Given in most cases the customers are constantly busy on their phones it took an average of 20 more minutes from when they were done eating until they requested a check.</p> <p>Furthermore once the check was delivered it took 15 minutes longer than 10 years ago for them to pay and leave.</p> <p>8 out of 45 customers bumped into other customers or in one case a waiter (texting while walking) as they were either walking in or out of the restaurant.</p> <p>Average time from start to finish: 1:55</p> <p>We are grateful for everyone who comes into our restaurant, after all there are so many choices out there. But can you please be a bit more considerate?</p> </div> </blockquote> <p>Now it’s your turn.

Defining recreation as it pertains to tourism, however, is more challenging.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1572" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1572" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1572" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over.jpg" alt="Two people climb a rock face." width="400" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Up-and-Over-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1572">Figure 5.1 Climbers in Squamish, B.C.</div></div> <p>Let’s start by exploring some recreation-based terms that are common in the tourism industry.&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">Outdoor recreation</span> can be defined as “outdoor activities that take place in a natural setting, as opposed to a highly cultivated or managed landscape such as a playing field or golf course” (Tourism BC, 2013, p. 47).&nbsp; This term is typically applied to outdoor activities that individuals engage in and that are located close to their community.&nbsp;When these activities are further away, and people must travel some distance to participate in them, they are often described as&nbsp;adventure tourism.</p> <p>According to the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), <span class="glossary-term">adventure tourism</span> is “a trip that includes at least two of the following three elements: physical activity, natural environment, and cultural immersion” (UNWTO,&nbsp;2014, p.12).&nbsp; Examples of adventure tourism in BC include river rafting, helicopter skiing, and rock climbing.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Adventure Travel Trade Association</strong></p> <p>The Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA) actively engages in research about the Adventure Tourism industry. More information and industry reports can be found at the <a href="https://www.adventuretravel.biz/research/" data-url="https://www.adventuretravel.biz/research/">Adventure Travel Trade Association website</a>.</p> </div> <p>Adventure tourism can be “soft” or “hard.” Differentiating between the two is somewhat subjective, but is loosely based on the level of experience required, the level of fitness required, and the degree to which the participant is exposed to risk (UNWTO, 2014).&nbsp; Examples of soft adventure include wildlife viewing or moderate hiking, whereas river rafting or outdoor rock climbing would usually be considered hard adventure.</p> <p>Another term that is used, one that overlaps with the definitions of&nbsp;outdoor recreation and adventure tourism, is&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">nature-based tourism</span>, which refers to “those tourism experiences that are directly or indirectly dependent on the natural environment” (Tourism BC, 2005b, p.6).&nbsp; This term is often used to describe activities that are closely connected to nature, such as whale watching, birding, or self-propelled travel such as hiking and kayaking. Nature-based tourism can be either hard or soft adventure tourism.</p> <p>As you can see, there are challenges in classifying recreation in tourism. For instance, if people kayak near their home or community, it may be considered <span class="glossary-term">outdoor recreation</span>. If they travel afar for that same activity, it likely is designated as <span class="glossary-term">adventure tourism</span>. If the kayaking is done in protected, mild conditions, it would be considered soft adventure, but if done in a challenging and risky river descent, it may be classified as hard adventure. Generally, the further away from established infrastructure and medical assistance, the harder the adventure activity.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

They value natural beauty and rank this as the highest factor when choosing a destination, and the most cited reasons for their travel are relaxation “relaxation, exploring new places, time with family, and learning about different cultures” (UNWTO, 2014, p.15).</p> <p>Globally, it is estimated that the continents of Europe, North America, and South America account for 69% of adventure tourism, or US$263 billion in adventure travel spending. Adventure tourists tend to be seen as high-value visitors, with as much of 70% of their expenditures remaining in the communities visited (UNWTO, 2014).</p> <p>The size, extent, and economic contribution of recreation, outdoor recreation, and adventure tourism in British Columbia is also substantial.

Golf also directly employs more than 155,000 people and contributes more than $11 billion directly to Canada’s gross domestic product. BC has over 300 golf course facilities, and with over $2 billion annually in direct economic activity, the golfing industry in the province is the fourth largest in Canada (Strategic Networks Inc., 2009).</p> <p>Golf is a significant tourism attraction in BC; in 2007 the province was chosen as the “Best Golf Course Destination in North America” by the International Association of Golf Tour Operators (Destination BC, 2014c).&nbsp; Part of the draw is the diverse environment; golfers can choose from lush coastal forests to desert environments, and many courses have a viewscape of mountains or the ocean.</p> <p>A 2006 study by Destination Canada formally the Canadian Tourism Commission (CTC) detailed both demographic and economic factors related to the Canadian golf industry. Significant findings included that there were more than 3.4 million golf travellers in Canada annually, and that of those travellers, approximately 34% travelled to BC. In addition, the Canadian golf participation rate (for the total Canadian population) was 21.5%, which is among the highest golf participation rates of any country in the world. Golfing provides an opportunity to attract significant tourism revenue as the average golf traveller has a much higher than average income level, with up to 50% of all golf travellers earning $100,000 or more per annum (Tourism BC, 2009b).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: British Columbia Golf Marketing Alliance</strong></p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">British Columbia Golf Marketing Alliance</span> is a strategic alliance that represents 58 regional and destination golf resorts in BC.

Many of mountain resorts have diversified to offer summer operations, including mountain bike parks, hiking, and sight seeing. Mountain resorts in BC can be separated into two principal categories: destination resorts and regional resorts. <span class="glossary-term">Destination mountain resorts</span> are often significantly larger and offer a greater range of amenities such as on mountain accommodation and food services; they are also generally marketed to out-of-area and international visitors. Examples of a destination resort would include <a href="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/" data-url="https://www.whistlerblackcomb.com/">Whistler Blackcomb Ski&nbsp;Resort</a>. On the other hand, <span class="glossary-term">regional mountain resorts</span> are usually smaller in size and capacity, have fewer amenities, and often cater more directly to the local community (Tourism BC, 2011c) such as <a href="https://www.skiwhitewater.com" data-url="https://www.skiwhitewater.com">Whitewater Ski Resort</a> in the Kootenay Rockies.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Canada West Ski Areas Association</strong></p> <p>Ski areas in Western Canada (Alberta and BC) are represented by the <span class="glossary-term">Canada West Ski Areas Association (CWSAA)</span>, which has a diverse mandate that includes marketing, advocacy, environmental stewardship, and risk management.&nbsp;For more information, visit&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.cwsaa.org" data-url="http://www.cwsaa.org">Canada West Ski Areas Association website</a>.</p> </div> <p>The aggregate economic value of destination mountain resorts is significant; one&nbsp;study by Tourism BC found that 13 of these resorts&nbsp;were responsible for generating approximately 1.1 billion in revenue, or 8% of the total provincial tourism revenues in 2008.&nbsp;Additionally, they provided the equivalent of 14,267 full-time equivalent jobs (Tourism BC, 2011c). Furthermore,&nbsp;BC’s top mountain resorts have received many prestigious awards (Tourism BC, 2011c, p. 11):</p> <ul><li>Whistler Blackcomb has consistently been named the #1 ski resort in North America.</li> <li>In 2009, Sun Peaks was named one of the “Top 20 Ski Resorts in North America” by  Condé Nast Traveler.</li> <li>Big White Ski Resort was recognized in 2009 as a “Top 5 Family Resort” by the UK-based <em>Sunday Times.</em></li> </ul> <p>The publicity that these resorts receive has undoubtedly reflected positively on the rest of the BC tourism industry.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Hello BC Skiing and Snowboarding in BC</strong></p> <p>Destination BC offers a specific mountain resort marketing website for destination resorts in BC.

Trail networks have been developed in both stand-alone environments, as well as in partnership with large mountain resorts such as Silver Star in Vernon, Sun Peaks in Kamloops, Cypress Mountain above Vancouver, and Rossland in the Kootenays. Many of these trail networks offer both groomed and track-set trails, and many are lit for night skiing.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Silver Star’s Sovereign Lake Nordic Centre<br /> </strong></p> <p>Located just outside Vernon, Sovereign Lake is Canada’s largest daily groomed trail network that includes 105 kilometres of trails varying from green (easy) to black diamond (most difficult); a further trail expansion is planned for 2015.

BC is regarded as a world-class destination for backcountry access, and has seen considerable and sustained growth in this sector (Porteus, 2013). The motivator for pursuing this activity for most people is primarily the lure of fresh, untracked snow in a beautiful mountain setting. Some backcountry skiers and snowboarders combine this activity with helicopter or snowcat skiing.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Backcountry Lodges of British Columbia Association</strong></p> <p>The Backcountry Lodges of British Columbia Association (BLBCA) represents backcountry lodges in the province.

During the winter of 2015, there were 11 established snowcat skiing operations in BC (HeliCat Canada, n.d.).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Avalanche Canada</strong></p> <p>This organization provides public avalanche forecasts and education for any backcountry travellers venturing into avalanche terrain.&nbsp;This vital service is provided to the public free of charge, as&nbsp;Avalanche Canada is a not-for-profit society dedicated to a vision of eliminating avalanche injuries and fatalities in Canada.

These operators typically offer accommodation in a ranch-type environment, and include as part of the experience the opportunity to participate in ranch activities such as horse riding and cattle wrangling.&nbsp;Other&nbsp;services and activities may also be available, such as&nbsp;spa treatments, hiking, canoeing, and fishing (BC Guest Ranchers Association, n.d.).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: The British Columbia Guest Ranchers Association</strong></p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">British Columbia Guest Ranchers Association (BCGRA)</span> represents guest and dude ranch operators in the province.&nbsp;It&nbsp;serves and represents its members through&nbsp;cooperative marketing, advertising, development of operational standards, and member pricing on liability insurance plans (BCGRA, n.d.). For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.bcguestranches.com/" data-url="http://www.bcguestranches.com/">British Columbia Guest Ranchers Association website</a>.</p> </div> <p>A 2011 study of guest ranches by Tourism BC found that there were 57 operating ranches in the province.&nbsp;Most of these were small operations with one to five employees and serving fewer than 1,000 clients per year (Tourism BC, 2011a). There are also large operations such as the Hills Health Guest Ranch located near 100 Mile House, which can accommodate hundreds of guests at one time. The ranch features a full on-site spa and two dining rooms, and hosts a multitude of special events each year. Two other examples of unique guest ranch operations are the Siwash Lake Ranch in south-central BC, a “high-end” exclusive resort featuring executive-chef prepared meals, and the Echo Valley Ranch and Spa in the BC interior, offering an alternative therapy spa and gold-panning excursions.</p> <h3>Hunting Outfitters</h3> <p>Hunting is a traditional recreational activity in BC, and it is also one of the original tourism products in the province (GOABC, n.d.). BC is fortunate to have a vast amount of wilderness available for hunting activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;The exact size of the hunting market is difficult to quantify, but in 2003, a study found that 5,000 non-resident hunting licences were sold in BC, contributing $46 million to the provincial economy (CTC, 2012).</p> <p>Some people choose self-guided hunting activities, but to hunt certain species, a guide outfitter must be hired. Guide outfitters are licensed by the BC Government to provide commercial hunting services for non-residents. This commercial hunt service directly employs more than 2,000 BC residents and generates approximately $116 million in economic activity annually (GOABC, n.d.). Many of these outfitters are small family operations &nbsp;based in rural areas; they are a source valuable economic activity in areas with limited resources (GOABC, n.d.).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Guide Outfitters Association of BC<br /> </strong></p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Guide Outfitters Association of BC (GOABC)</span> was established in 1966 to promote and preserve the interests of guide outfitters who take hunters out into wildlife habitat. GOABC is also the publisher of <em>Mountain Hunter</em> magazine. Its website outlines a code of conduct and standards for guide outfitters as well as a wildlife DNA collection program to help provide insight into animal populations. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.goabc.org" data-url="http://www.goabc.org">Guide Outfitters Association of BC website</a>.</p> </div> <h2>Cycling</h2> <p>Cycling is a popular recreational activity in BC thanks to a variety of terrain, spectacular scenery, and favourable weather conditions, with approximately 44% of residents participating&nbsp;each year (Tourism BC, 2013).&nbsp;Cycling also attracts out-of-province visitors. One study&nbsp;from 2008 reported that out of 5.6 million Canadians who travelled to BC over a two-year period, almost one million (17%) had participated in a cycling activity (Tourism BC, 2009).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Cycling Destinations</strong></p> <p>Several BC destinations have developed cycling as a key tourism product. For example, the Salt Spring Island group Island Pathways helped make the island more bike-friendly in recent years by installing bike racks, developing a map with bike routes, encouraging local transportation to accommodate bikes, and establishing local bike rentals and service. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.saltspringtourism.com/cycling/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.saltspringtourism.com/cycling/">Salt Spring Island Cycling</a>.</p> <p>Another great example of cycling tourism is the Kettle Valley Railway in the Okanagan, built on an abandoned rail bed. This 600-kilometre trail network includes a multitude of tunnels and trestles, and is most often travelled by cycling. Sections of the trail system are also now included in the Trans Canada Trail. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.kettlevalleyrailway.ca/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.kettlevalleyrailway.ca/">Kettle Valley Railway website</a>.</p> </div> <p>Cycling can be generalized into two styles: road cycling and mountain biking.</p> <p>Road cycling appeals to those who want to travel on paved roads on bikes designed for&nbsp;travelling long distances efficiently and effectively. Road cycling may&nbsp;refer to racing, both&nbsp;recreational and professional, or cycle touring, where cyclists travel by bike on single- or&nbsp;multi-day trips. Given the multitude of rolling hills,&nbsp;mountain passes, and stunning vistas, BC is regarded as a premier cycle touring destination (Destination BC, 2014b).</p> <p>Mountain biking generally involves riding on unpaved routes and trails either specially designed for biking or for multipurpose use. BC’s reputation as a prime mountain biking destination&nbsp;has grown because of the&nbsp;unique array of trails available, ranging from the steep, challenging routes of Vancouver’s North Shore, to the high alpine cross-country routes found in the South Chilcotin Mountains (Tourism BC, 2011b).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Western Mountain Bike Tourism Association<br /> </strong></p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">Western Mountain Bike Tourism Association (MBTA)</span> is a valuable resource for operators or communities seeking to develop or promote mountain biking tourism in their area. It can be found at <a href="https://www.mbta.ca/" data-url="https://www.mbta.ca/">Mountain Bike Tourism Association website</a>.</p> </div> <p>Over the years,&nbsp;mountain biking has grown from being a fringe activity to a mainstay of the tourism economy.&nbsp;In fact, the growth potential of mountain biking is so highly regarded that the BC Government now considers it as one of the top growth areas in the outdoor adventure sector (Tourism BC, 2011b).</p> <p>Indeed, numerous mountain winter resorts such as Whistler Blackcomb, Silverstar, and Kicking Horse have developed mountain biking trail infrastructure and lift-accessed biking to provide off-season activities. World-class mountain biking races such as the BC Bike Race bring thousands of riders through small communities for mountain biking. The economic impact of these events is significant. Over the course of a single four-month season in the Sea-to-Sky Corridor in 2016 (including the communities of North Vancouver, Squamish, Whistler and Pemberton), the economic contribution of mountain biking to local economies was $70.6 million (Western Canada Mountain Bike Tourism Association, 2016).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: GranFondo Whistler</strong></p> <p>The GranFondo Whistler is a road biking race from Vancouver to Whistler that now attracts upward of 7,000 participants each year.

Of these visitors, 2.3 million were overnight campers, generating $15.5 million in user fees, with an average guest satisfaction rating of 82% (BC Parks, 2012). As discussed in <a class="internal" href="#part-accommodation" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/accommodation/">Chapter 3</a>, there are also a number of private camping providers in the province.</p> <h2>Wildlife Viewing</h2> <p>Given the diversity and richness of our natural environment, it is not surprising that there is a thriving wildlife viewing industry in BC. This includes whale, bird, and bear watching as well as travelling to view the northern lights or alpine flowers (CTC, 2007). One study conducted by the Destination BC established that within BC, approximately 37% of tourists took part in wildlife viewing while visiting. Significantly, for 13% of visitors, the primary motivation for their travel to BC was wildlife viewing (CTC, 2007).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Wilderness Tourism Association of British Columbia </strong></p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">Wilderness Tourism Association of British Columbia (WTA)</span> provides industry support and advocacy for those operators offering nature-based tourism products.&nbsp;For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.wilderness-tourism.bc.ca/" data-url="http://www.wilderness-tourism.bc.ca/">Wilderness Tourism Association of BC website</a>.</p> </div> <p>Whale watching occurs along the coast of BC, with tours sometimes leaving from major urban centres, but more commonly from smaller communities such as Telegraph Cove on northern Vancouver Island.&nbsp;Tours are typically by boat, on&nbsp;vessels ranging from open, 10-passenger Zodiacs, to comfortable cabin cruisers with inside seating.&nbsp;The most commonly observed whale is the orca, one of the province’s most distinctive animals.&nbsp;Other whales like the humpback, minke, and Pacific grey are also frequently encountered.&nbsp;The province’s vast diversity of marine life is a key attraction of the tours; in addition to whale watching, a typical tour may encounter bald eagles, sea lions, porpoises, and a variety of sea birds (Destination BC, 2014,d).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Mammal Viewing Guidelines</strong></p> <p>Marine mammal viewing in Canada has grown in popularity to the point where the federal government has established marine wildlife viewing guidelines. These establish parameters such as safe viewing distances and time limits and are enforceable by law when breached. In addition, the ‘see a blow, go slow” campaign, developed by the Marine Education and Research Society (MERS) has been promoted to recreational boaters and commercial whale watchers alike.

Black bears are common across all regions of BC. Grizzly bears are more likely to be found in remote and mountainous regions; they have an estimated population in the province of approximately 16,000. Kermode bears, also called spirit bears, are a subspecies of black bears with a genetic trait that produces white fur instead of black. They are found primarily in the Great Bear Rainforest of the Central Coast, and figure prominently in the spiritual traditions of BC’s Coastal First Nations. The spirit bear is also BC’s official animal (Destination BC, 2014a).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1578" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1578" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1575" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet.jpg" alt="A bear walking along the water's edge." width="400" height="500" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet.jpg 960w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-240x300.jpg 240w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-819x1024.jpg 819w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-768x960.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-65x81.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-225x281.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Grizzly-on-Bute-Inlet-350x438.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1578">Figure 5.2 A bear in Bute Inlet, B.C.</div></div> <p>Tourism operators that offer bear viewing typically operate in remote regions of BC.&nbsp;They may utilize raised viewing areas or operate from a boat-based platform, and offer accommodation at night.&nbsp;The season is typically limited to May through October, with the highest chances of viewing success during the salmon spawning season in the fall.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Commercial Bear Viewing Association of BC</strong></p> <p>Bear viewing is a complex activity with potential for physical risk to visitors and impacts to the bears.

For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.diveindustryassociation.com/" data-url="http://www.diveindustryassociation.com/">Dive Industry Association of BC website</a>.</p> </div> <h2>Sport Fishing and Lodges</h2> <p>There is a long and rich history of sport fishing in BC. Anglers are drawn to the province’s tidal waters (for salmon and halibut) and to freshwater rivers and lakes (for trout, steelhead, and sturgeon). The annual rate of recreational participation is significant; a 2009 study estimated that there are nearly 600,000 anglers (either fresh or saltwater) in any given year in BC (Tourism BC, 2009). Furthermore, non-resident anglers contributed almost $6 million by way of licensing fees, and an additional $46 million in non-fishing expenditures to the economy of BC. The <a href="http://bcfroa.ca/" data-url="http://bcfroa.ca/">British Columbia Fishing Resorts and Outfitters Association (BCFROA)</a> represents commercial freshwater resorts and outfitters and delivers advocacy, conservation, and marketing efforts on behalf of its members (BCFROA, n.d.).</p> <h2>Paddle Sports</h2> <p>River rafting, canoeing, sea kayaking, and standup paddle boarding (SUP) are common activities for both recreationists and tourists alike in BC.&nbsp; Collectively, these sports fall under the paddle sports category, which encompasses any activity that takes place in small boats propelled by paddles (Education Scotland, n.d.).&nbsp; Although all paddle sports are popular recreational activities, two of the more sizable and commercially productive paddle sports subsectors are river rafting and sea kayaking.</p> <p>River rafting operators can be found on many rivers across BC. Product offerings may range from a three-hour adrenaline-fueled tour on the famous Fraser River to a 14-day wilderness exploration down the UNESCO World Heritage Tatshenshini-Alsek Rivers in northern BC.&nbsp; These trips consist primarily of three types of rafting: paddle rafting, motorized rafting, and float trips (Destination BC, n.d.).</p> <p>Commercial rafting in BC is represented by the <a href="http://www.bcroa.com/" data-url="http://www.bcroa.com/">British Columbia River Outfitters Association (BCROA)</a>, which acts as a regulatory and marketing organization for river rafting in the province. Guides are required to be certified at one of three levels: guide, senior guide, or trip leader.&nbsp; Each river in BC that is commonly rafted has an extensive set of safety requirements called “provisions” listed by the BCROA. These provisions set out the minimum level of guide required, acceptable water levels ranges, and type of equipment needed for each river excursion (BCROA, n.d.).</p> <div class="mceTemp"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1578" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1577" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure.jpg" alt="Rafters pose with their paddles, standing in a raft on a river." width="600" height="450" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rafting-Adventure-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.4 A rafting trip with Canadian Outback Adventures and Events near Squamish, B.C.</div></div> <p>A 2005 study conducted by Tourism BC identified 59 operators offering river rafting trips in the province.&nbsp;With an average of 5.5 employees, these operations are typically small in comparison to other industry subsectors.&nbsp;Collectively, however, they provided services to 216,000 customers and contributed almost $15 million in gross revenues to the BC economy in 2005.&nbsp;The same study also indicated that up to 75% of participants had travelled to join in the activity, indicating that they can predominantly be classified as adventure tourists (Tourism BC, 2007a).</p> <p>Sea kayaking in BC has grown into a sizable recreational and commercial industry in recent years. The province is highly regarded internationally for its long coastline punctuated by many inlets and fjords.&nbsp;Kayaking trips&nbsp;may be as short as an afternoon harbour tour, or as long as a seven-day wilderness exploration to the remote regions of Vancouver Island.&nbsp;Noteworthy areas for sea kayakers include Pacific Rim National Park on western Vancouver Island, Johnstone Strait on northern Vancouver Island, and Gwaii Haanas National Park in Haida Gwaii.</p> <p>A 2005 report entitled <em>British Columbia’s Sea Kayaking Sector</em> identified more than 114 operators offering rentals, instruction, day tours, or multi-day tours.&nbsp; These operators reported gross revenues of approximately $14 million in 2005 (Tourism BC, 2005a). A 2013 ecotourism survey conducted by Raincoast Conservation reflected growth of the sea kayaking sector with half (49%) of operators having grown between 2008-2013 (Raincoast Conservation, 2015).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: The Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of B.C.</strong></p> <p>Commercial operators offering tours are represented by the <span class="glossary-term">Sea Kayak Guides Alliance of B.C.

However, there are challenges that impact the viability of this sector, as well as barriers that limit the growth. These topics are discussed briefly here.</p> <h1>Land and Water Use</h1> <p>Outdoor recreation and adventure tourism operators rely heavily on intact pristine environments and healthy ecosystems. The ‘use’ of British Columbia’s vast wilderness and access to these wilderness areas for tourism operators is an ongoing challenge. Some zones across the province are set aside for recreation, such as provincial and national parks. However, when it comes to conducting commercial operations in these same places, gaining access often involves an extensive permitting process that may impose restrictions on the type of activity, how the activity is carried out and the number of visitors allowed.</p> <p>In addition, parks are generally limited to non-motorized activities, thus presenting barriers for tourism operators that seek to offer mechanized recreation. Operators using Crown land for commercial activities also require authorization from the provincial government; in some instances, priority may be given to resource extraction or development rather than outdoor operators. The permitting process can be onerous and time consuming, which for small operators, may be a barrier to growth (Wilderness Tourism Association, 2005).</p> <p>Environmental issues are discussed in detail in <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a>.</p> <h1>Environmental Impacts<a id="retfig5.6" class="internal" href="" data-url=""></a></h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1581" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1581" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1581" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Absolutely-Nothing-Is-Allowed-Here.jpg" alt="Sign banning various activities.

On a local scale, competition with resource extraction for wilderness areas is a vital issue; without reliable access to pristine wilderness, many operators are facing threats to their sustainability (Wilderness Tourism Association, 2005).&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, conflicts with the oil and gas industry, forestry, and mining are constant management challenges for wilderness tourism operators. On a global scale, climate change threatens tourism in BC in many ways, including irregular and insufficient snowfall for winter operations, the pine beetle epidemic sweeping through the province’s forests, and climate-related stress impacting prime wildlife viewing of species such as whales and bears. Environmental issues are discussed in detail in <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a>.</p> <h1>Risk Management</h1> <p>Concerns over risk management and litigation are ongoing for any operator that offers activities with an element of risk, which is common in recreation and adventure tourism. When lawsuits in adventure tourism occur, they are often extensively publicized by the media, creating a perception of risky, dangerous, and irresponsible adventure operators. This can negatively affect the sector through rising insurance rates, increasing governmental regulation, challenging certification requirements, and permitting difficulties when interfacing with land management agencies.</p> <p>With the popularity of backcountry skiing, snowboarding, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and other winter sports on the rise in BC, the number of participants accessing backcountry areas is increasing (Mitsui, 2013). This is becoming a concern for long-time backcountry enthusiasts as well as safety monitors. As winter and summer backcountry equipment becomes more readily accessible, people are able to equip themselves without having received advanced safety training.</p> <p>The increase of backcountry users will continue to expose users to possible dangerous situations. The best scenario is to ensure users receive proper training and education before they venture into the backcountry areas.</p> <p>Other elements of risk and liability are discussed further in <a class="internal" href="#part-risk-management-and-legal-liability" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/risk-management-and-legal-liability/">Chapter 11</a>.</p> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="fig5.6">Figure 5.6 long description:&nbsp;</strong>Sign with pictograms with red slashes through them, banning various recreational activities.

Documenting every activity that could be on a tourist’s to-do list would be nearly impossible, for what one traveler would find entertaining, another may not. This chapter focuses on the major components of arts, entertainment, and attractions, including motion pictures, video exhibitions, and wineries; all activities listed under the North American Industry Classification System we learned about in <a class="internal" href="#part-history-and-overview" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/history-and-overview/">Chapter 1</a>.</p> <p>Festival and Major Events Canada (FAME) released a report in 2019 detailing the economic impacts of the 17 largest festivals and events in Quebec, which amounted to a whopping $378 million in tourist spending.

When the Canadian Tourism Commission, now Destination Canada, planned a survey of Canada’s tourist attractions in 1995, there was no official definition of <span class="glossary-term">tourist attractions</span>. After consultation, federal, provincial, territorial, and industry stakeholders agreed on a working definition: “places whose main purpose is to allow public access for entertainment, interest, or education” (Canadian Tourism Commission, 1998, p. 3).</p> <p>Five major categories were established:</p> <ol><li>Heritage attractions: focus on preserving and exhibiting objects, sites, and natural wonders of historical, cultural, and educational value (e.g., museums, art galleries, historic sites, <span class="glossary-term">botanical gardens</span>, zoos, nature parks, conservation areas)</li> <li>Amusement/entertainment attractions: maintain and provide access to amusement or entertainment facilities (e.g.,&nbsp;arcades; amusement, theme, and water parks)</li> <li>Recreational attractions: maintain and provide access to outdoor or indoor facilities where people can participate in sports and recreational activities (e.g., golf courses, skiing facilities, marinas, bowling centres)</li> <li>Commercial attractions: retail operations dealing in gifts, handcrafted goods, and souvenirs that actively market to tourists (e.g.,&nbsp;craft stores listed in a tourist guide)</li> <li>Industrial attractions: deal mainly in agriculture, forestry, and manufacturing products that actively market to tourists (e.g.,&nbsp;wineries, fish hatcheries, factories)</li> </ol> <p>The term “attraction” can convey a negative meaning. Something becoming a <span class="glossary-term">tourist attraction</span> can imply a site that has been commercialized and, likely, negatively impacted by tourism. In addition, attraction typically denotes pleasure and fun, like an amusement park. The term becomes inappropriate, as does ‘entertainment’ when we speak of learning about other cultures and contested histories. For example, the Nikkei Internment Memorial Centre, in New Denver, BC is a National Historic Site of Canada, and tells the history of Japanese-Canadian internment during the Second World War. Another example may be an Indigenous art gallery, with many objects representing the spiritual beliefs and history of a people’s ancestors. Although both examples are technically sites of interest to tourists and therefore attractions, the mandate, approach, and design of the visitor experience varies from site to site.</p> <p>To exist, these attractions often need to generate revenue to pay for site operations, to pay for staff, and to run educational programs. The sector involves a range of organizations, some privately owned, while others are government-funded, or non-profit. Revenue to culture- and nature-based sites has the added benefit of supporting their preservation as well as to build awareness and a deeper understanding in the public. In the case of Indigenous heritage sites, visitation can also lead to an opportunity for reconciliation. However, the cost of an attraction, such as a museum, gallery, or park, is typically only a fraction of the total travel cost.</p> <p>The rest of this chapter explores various types of attractions in more detail.</p> <h1>Cultural/Heritage Tourism</h1> <p>The phrase <span class="glossary-term">cultural/heritage tourism</span> can be interpreted in many ways. Destination Canada, formally the Canadian Tourism Commission has defined it as tourism occurring “when participation in a cultural or heritage activity is a significant factor for traveling. Cultural tourism includes performing arts (theatre, dance, and music), visual arts and crafts, festivals, museums and cultural centres, and historic sites and interpretive centres” (LinkBC, 2012). Food is also an integral part of the cultural tourism scene.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1598" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1598" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1595" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer.jpg" alt="A man dressed in a Victorian suit and bowler hat, speaking into a megaphone." width="500" height="313" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer-300x188.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer-768x480.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer-65x41.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer-225x141.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Barkerville-pioneer-350x219.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1598">Figure 6.4 A “pioneer” at the Barkerville historic site near Quesnel, B.C.</div></div> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The First Government of Canada Survey of Heritage Institutions</strong></p> <p>In 2018, the Department of Canadian Heritage released its <em>Survey of Heritage Institutions,</em> which provides aggregate financial and operating data to governments and cultural associations.

Both art museums and public galleries present works of art to the public, exhibiting a diverse range of art from more well-known artists to emerging artists. Exhibitions are assembled and organized by a curator who oversees the installation of the works in the gallery space. However, art museums and public galleries have different mandates, and therefore offer different visitor experiences.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Art museums</span> collect historical and modern works of art for educational purposes and to preserve them for future generations. <span class="glossary-term">Public galleries</span>, on the other hand, do not generally collect or conserve works of art.

Theme parks have a long history dating back to the 1500s in Europe, and have evolved ever since. Today, it is hard not to try to compare any amusement park destination to Disneyland and Disney World.&nbsp;Opened in 1955 in sunny California, Disneyland&nbsp;set the standard for&nbsp;theme parks.

But the entertainment sector doesn’t exist in a perfect world. Now let’s examine some of the trends and issues in the sector today. Festivals, events, and other entertainment experiences can have significant positive and negative impacts on communities and guests.</p> <h1>Impacts of&nbsp;Entertainment</h1> <p>Each type of festival, event, or attraction will have an impact on the host community and guests. Table 6.2 lists some of the positive impacts that can be built upon and celebrated. It also lists some of the potential negative impacts event coordinators should strive to limit.</p> <table style="width: 100%; height: 753px;"><caption>Table 6.2 Positive and negative impacts of entertainment activities (festivals, events, attractions) on the guest and host communities</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 18px;"><td style="height: 18px; text-align: center;" colspan="3"><a class="internal" href="#table6.2" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/6-trends-and-issues/#table6.2">[Skip Table]</a></td> </tr> <tr style="height: 18px;"><th style="height: 18px;" scope="col">Type of Impact</th> <th style="height: 18px;" scope="col">Positive Impacts</th> <th style="height: 18px;" scope="col">Negative Impacts</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="height: 159px;"><th style="height: 159px;" scope="row">Social and Cultural</th> <td style="height: 159px;"><ul><li>Shared experience</li> <li>Revitalizing traditions</li> <li>Building community pride</li> <li>Assisting community groups</li> <li>Expanding cultural perspectives</li> </ul> </td> <td style="height: 159px;"><ul><li>Community alienation</li> <li>Negative community image</li> <li>Bad behaviour</li> <li>Substance abuse or addiction</li> <li>Social dislocation</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 186px;"><th style="height: 186px;" scope="row">Physical and Environmental</th> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>Increasing environmental awareness</li> <li>Ensuring infrastructure legacy</li> <li>Improved transport/communications</li> <li>Urban transformation and renewal</li> </ul> </td> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>Climate change</li> <li>Environmental damage</li> <li>Pollution</li> <li>Destruction of heritage</li> <li>Noise disturbance</li> <li>Traffic congestion</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 186px;"><th style="height: 186px;" scope="row">Political</th> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>International prestige</li> <li>Improved profile</li> <li>Promotion of investment in the host community</li> <li>Social cohesion</li> <li>Development of event/administrative skills</li> </ul> </td> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>Risk of event failure</li> <li>Misallocation of funds</li> <li>Lack of accountability</li> <li>Propaganda purposes</li> <li>Loss of ownership and control</li> <li>Legitimization of political ideology</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 186px;"><th style="height: 186px;" scope="row">Tourist and Economic</th> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>Destination promotion</li> <li>Increased tourist visits</li> <li>Extended length of visitor stay</li> <li>Higher economic yield</li> <li>Increased tax revenue</li> <li>Permanent and temporary job creation</li> </ul> </td> <td style="height: 186px;"><ul><li>Community resistance to tourism</li> <li>Loss of authenticity</li> <li>Damage to reputation</li> <li>Exploitation</li> <li>Inflated prices</li> <li>Opportunity costs</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h1 id="table6.2">Technology</h1> <p>The role of technology has shifted much of the guest experience from the physical to the virtual. Online gambling, virtual exhibits, and live streaming animal habitat cams are just a few of the new ways that visitors can be entertained, often without having to visit the destination. As this type of experience continues to thrive, the sector must constantly adapt to capture revenues and attention.</p> </div></div>

Those working in the entertainment tourism sector know that providing a friendly, welcoming experience is a key component in sustaining any tourism destination. Whether through festivals, events, attractions, or new virtual components, the tourism industry relies on entertainment to complete packages and ensure guests, whether business or leisure travellers, increase their spending and enjoyment.</p> <p>Thus far we’ve explored the key sectors of transportation, accommodation, food and beverage, and recreation and entertainment.

The cidery itself was established by the previous owner in 1990 who planted apple trees in the location, which is considered ideal by many for its terrain and climate. With the purchase of the cidery, Janet and Rick undertook an extensive renovation in order to transform the facility into an agritourism attraction. They expanded the cellar and tasting rooms and created the Cider House in 2003 from which they began running tours and tastings. From there they added:</p> <ul><li>The Farmhouse Store with retail sales of their cider product, local agriculture products, and BC arts and crafts</li> <li>The Bistro and Orchard Cookhouse, two distinct food and beverage operations</li> <li>The Brick Oven Bakery (producing artisanal baked goods in its on-site brick oven)</li> <li>Yurts (two cabin-style tents) for onsite accommodation</li> </ul> <p>The cidery is now a destination for special events such as weddings. It also runs an InCider Club for frequent purchasers of its products.</p> <p>Visit the <a href="https://www.merridale.ca/" data-url="https://www.merridale.ca/">Merridale website</a> and answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>What is Merridale’s core business?</li> <li>Who are its customers?</li> <li>Merridale comprises&nbsp;food and beverage, retail, accommodations, and is an attraction. How would you classify it as a tourism operation?</li> <li>Is Merridale a seasonal operation? What would you consider to be its peak season? How has it extended revenue-earning opportunities?</li> <li>Merridale’s slogan is “Apples Expressed.” Does this tagline capture its essence? Why or why not?</li> <li>Consider Merridale’s products, experiences, and markets. What partners should the cidery work with, either globally or locally, to attract business? Name at least three.</li> <li>Do you think Merridale should add components, or eliminate components, from its business? Explain your answer.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <h1>References</h1> <p class="hanging-indent">Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada.

This sector is made up of businesses and organizations that work in a coordinated effort to provide travellers with seamless arrangements to maximize their travel experience. Go2HR describes travel services experiences and employment opportunities as follows:</p> <p>Within this sector, you have the flexibility of working in various capacities with event and conference planning organizations, travel companies and organizations, as well as associations, government agencies and companies that specialize in serving the needs of the tourism sector as a whole. (go2HR, Essential Tips – Travel Services, 2020)</p> <p>Before we move on, let’s explore the term <em>travel services</em> a little more. As detailed in <a class="internal" href="#part-history-and-overview" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/history-and-overview/">Chapter 1</a>, Canada, the United States, and Mexico have used the NAICS guidelines, which define the tourism industry as consisting of transportation, accommodation, food and beverage, recreation and entertainment, and travel services (Tourism HR Canada, 2020). These five sectors are defined and further detailed in B.C. by the B.C. government (BC Government, 2014) and go2HR on their website (go2HR, Career Explorer, 2020).</p> <p>For many years, however, the tourism industry was classified into eight sectors: accommodations, adventure and recreation, attractions, events and conferences, food and beverage, tourism services, transportation, and travel trade (Yukon Department of Tourism and Culture, 2020; go2HR, 2020, What is Tourism? – Travel Services).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1610" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1610" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1607" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage.jpg" alt="Travel website showing outdoor activities in B.C., such as skiing and surfing." width="500" height="323" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage.jpg 1600w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-300x194.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-1024x660.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-768x495.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-1536x991.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-225x145.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/HelloBC-Homepage-350x226.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1610">Figure 7.1 The homepage of HelloBC.com, a site where consumers can research and plan their trip to British Columbia.</div></div> <p><span class="glossary-term">Tourism services</span> support industry development and the delivery of guest experiences, and some of these are missing from the NAICS classification. To ensure you have a complete picture of the tourism industry in BC, this chapter will cover both the NAICS travel services activities and some additional tourism services.</p> <p>First, we’ll review the components of <span class="glossary-term">travel services</span> as identified under NAICS, as well as exploring popular careers within:</p> <ol><li>Travel agencies (brick and mortar)</li> <li>Online Travel Agencies/OTA</li> <li>Tour operators</li> <li>Destination marketing organizations (DMOs)</li> <li>Other Organizations</li> </ol> <p>Following these definitions and descriptions, we’ll take a look at some other support functions that fall under tourism services. These include sector organizations, tourism and hospitality human resources organizations, training providers, educational institutions, government branches and ministries, economic development and city planning offices, and consultants.</p> <p>Finally, we’ll look at issues and trends in travel services, both at home, and abroad.</p> <p>While the application of travel services functions are structured somewhat differently around the world, there are a few core types of travel services in every destination. Essentially, travel services are&nbsp;those processes used by guests to book components of their trip. Let’s explore these services in more detail.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Part of the role of the travel agency is to market prepackaged travel tours and holidays to potential travellers. The agency can further function as a broker between the traveller and hotels, car rentals, and tour companies (Goeldner &amp; Ritchie, 2003). Travel agencies can be small and privately owned or part of a larger entity.</p> <p>A <span class="glossary-term">travel agent</span> is the direct point of contact for a traveller who is researching and intending to purchase packages and experiences through an agency. Travel agents can specialize in certain types of travel including specific destinations; outdoor adventures; and backpacking, rail, cruise, cycling, or culinary tours, to name a few. These specializations can help travellers when they require advice about their trips. Some travel agents operate at a fixed address and others offer services both online and at a bricks-and-mortar location. Travellers are then able to have face-to-face conversations with their agents and also reach them by phone or by email. To promote professionalism within the travel industry, travel counsellors can apply for a specialized diploma or certificate in travel from <span class="glossary-term">ACTA</span> (ACTA, 2020a; go2HR, 2020a).</p> <p>Today, travellers have the option of researching and booking everything they need online without the help of a travel agent. As technology and the internet are increasingly being used to market destinations, people can now choose to book tours with a particular agency or agent, or they can be identified as seeking <strong>Domestic Independent Travel (DIT)</strong> or <strong>Foreign Independent Travel (FIT)</strong>, by creating their own itineraries from a number of suppliers.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:<br /> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1611#h5p-23" title="Chapter 7 Travel Services Agencies and Agents" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1611#h5p-23">https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1611#h5p-23</a> </p> </div> <h1>Online Travel Agents (OTAs)</h1> <p>Increasing numbers of travellers are turning to <span class="glossary-term">online travel agents</span> (OTAs), companies that aggregate accommodations and transportation options and allow users to choose one or many components of their trip based on price or other incentives. Examples of OTAs include iTravel2000, Booking.com, Expedia.ca, Hotwire.com, and Kayak.com. OTAs continue to gain popularity with the travelers; in 2012, they reported online sales of almost $100 billion (Carey, Kang, &amp; Zea, 2012) and almost triple that figure,&nbsp;upward of $278 billion, in 2013 (<em>The Economist</em>, 2014).</p> <p>In early 2015 Expedia purchased Travelocity for $280 million, merging two of the world’s largest travel websites. Expedia became the owner of&nbsp;Hotels.com, Hotwire, Egencia, and Travelocity brands, facing its major competition from Priceline (Alba, 2015).</p> <p>Although <span class="glossary-term">OTAs</span> can provide lower-cost travel options to travellers and the freedom to plan and reserve when they choose, they&nbsp;have posed challenges for the tourism industry and travel services infrastructure. As evidenced by the merger of Expedia and Travelocity, the majority of popular OTA sites are owned by just a few companies, causing some concern over lack of competition between brands.&nbsp;Additionally, many OTAs charge accommodation providers and operators a commission to be listed in&nbsp;their inventory system. Commission-based services, as applied by&nbsp;Kayak, Expedia, Hotwire, Hotels.com, and&nbsp;others, can have an impact on smaller operators who cannot afford to pay commissions for&nbsp;multiple&nbsp;online inventories (Carey, Kang &amp; Zea, 2012).&nbsp;Being excluded from listings can decrease the marketing reach of the product to potential travellers, which is&nbsp;a challenge when many service providers in the tourism industry are small or medium-sized businesses with budgets to match.</p> <p>While the industry and communities struggle to keep up with the changing dynamics of travel sales, travellers are adapting to this new world order. One of these adaptations is the ever-increasing use of mobile devices for travel booking. The <em>Expedia Future of Travel Report</em> found that 49% of travellers from the millennial generation (which includes those born between 1980 and 1999) use mobile devices to book travel (Expedia Inc., 2014), and these numbers are expected to continue to increase. Travel agencies are reacting by developing personalized features for digital travellers and mobile user platforms (ETC Digital, 2014). With the number of smartphone users expected to reach 1.75 billion in 2014 (CWT Travel Management Institute, 2014) these agencies must adapt as demand dictates.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1610" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1609" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996.jpg" alt="A chunky computer with a black and green screen." width="450" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/ATT-PC-6300-c.-1996-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7.3 This is what a computer looked like in 1996. Less than 25 years later, you can access the world from your mobile phone.</div></div> <p>A key feature of travel agencies’ (and to a growing extent transportation carriers) mobile services includes the ability to have up-to-date itinerary changes and information sent directly to consumers’ phones (Amadeus, 2014). By using mobile platforms that can develop customized, up-to-date travel itineraries for clients, agencies and operators are able to provide a personal touch, ideally increasing customer satisfaction rates.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><div><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: PATA — The Future of Travel is Personalisation at Scale</strong></p> <p>“The industry has changed monumentally over the past decade. The rise of meta-search websites and sharing economy services like Airbnb is giving travellers more control and choice than ever before. However, this is nothing compared to the changes that are on the horizon as technologies like mobile, AR, AI, and VR become mainstream.</p> <p>One thing is certain; the pace of change is accelerating. Against this backdrop, the travel industry as a whole will need to fundamentally shift its focus to continuous innovation.” (PATA, 2019)</p> </div> </div> <p>Despite the growth and demand for OTAs, brick and mortar travel agencies are still in demand by travellers (IBISWorld, 2019) as they have both an online presence and physical locations. The COVID-19 pandemic may see an increase in travellers relying on personal contact with brick and mortar travel agencies but at a distance through mail and phone.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

These packages can also be sold through retail outlets or travel agencies (CATO, 2020; Goeldner &amp; Ritchie, 2003). Tour operators work closely with hotels, transportation providers, and attractions in order to purchase large volumes of each component and package these at a better rate than the traveller could if purchasing individually. Tour operators generally sell to the leisure market.</p> <h2>Inbound, Outbound,&nbsp;and Receptive Tour Operators</h2> <p>Tour operators may be inbound, outbound, or receptive:</p> <ul><li><span class="glossary-term">Inbound tour operators</span>&nbsp;bring travellers into a country as a group or through individual tour packages (e.g., a package from China to visit Canada).</li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Outbound tour operators</span> work within a country to take travellers to other countries (e.g., a package from Canada to the United Kingdom).</li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Receptive tour operators</span> (RTOs) are not travel agents, and they do not operate the tours. They represent the various products of tourism suppliers to tour operators in other markets in a business-to-business (B2B) relationship. Receptive tour operators are key to selling packages to overseas markets (Destination BC, 2020) and creating awareness around possible product.</li> </ul> <h1>Destination Marketing Organizations</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Destination marketing organizations (DMOs)</span> include national tourism boards, state/provincial tourism offices, and community convention and visitor bureaus around the world. DMOs promote “the long-term development and marketing of a destination, focusing on convention sales, tourism marketing and service” (Destinations BC, 2020).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><div><div><p><strong>Spotlight On: Destinations International </strong></p> <p>Destinations International is the global trade association for official DMOs. It is made up of over 600 official DMOs in 15 countries around the world.

These are usually hosted by the local DMO and include visits to different tour operators within a region. FAM attendees can be media, travel agents, RTO representatives, and tour operator representatives. <span class="glossary-term">FAMs</span> are frequently low to no cost for the guests as the purpose is to orient them&nbsp;to the tour product or experience so they can promote or sell it to potential guests.</p> <h1>Other Organizations</h1> <p>The majority of examples in this chapter so far have pertained to leisure travellers. There are, however, specialty organizations that deal specifically with business trips.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><div><div><p><strong>Spotlight On: Global Business Travel Association (GBTA) Canada</strong></p> <p>“GBTA Canada is the voice of the Canadian business travel industry.

Travel managers negotiate with suppliers and ensure that all the trip components are cost effective&nbsp;and comply with the policies of the organization.</p> <p>Many business travel planners rely on&nbsp;global distribution systems (GDS) to price and plan components. GDS combine information from a group of suppliers, such as airlines. In the past, this has created a chain of information from the supplier to GDS&nbsp;to the travel management company. Today, however, there is a push from airlines (through the International Air Transport Association’s&nbsp;Resolution 787) to dissolve the GDS model and forge direct relationships with buyers&nbsp;(BTN Group, 2014).</p> <h2>Destination Management Companies</h2> <p>According to the Association of Destination Management Executives International (ADMEI), a <span class="glossary-term">destination management company (DMC)</span> specializes in designing and implementing corporate programs, and “is a strategic partner to provide creative local experiences in event management, tours/activities, transportation, entertainment, and program logistics” (ADMEI, 2020). The packages produced by DMCs are extraordinary experiences rather than general business trips. These are typically used as employee incentives, corporate retreats, product launches, and loyalty programs. <span class="glossary-term">DMCs</span> are the one point of contact for the client corporation, arranging for airfare, airport transfers, ground transportation, meals, special activities, and special touches such as branded signage, gifts, and decor (ADMEI, 2020). The end user is simply given (or awarded) the package and then liaises with the DMC to ensure particular arrangements meet his or her needs and schedule.</p> <p>As you can see, travel services range from online to personal, and from leisure to business applications. Now that you have a&nbsp;general sense of the components of travel services, let’s look at some examples in Canada and BC.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Working in cooperation with suppliers throughout the distribution chain, travel agencies provide an important link for the consumer to connect with the best options for a successful trip. Planning vacations or business trips can be complicated matters and qualified agents can help the traveller with professional services.</p> <p>In British Columbia and elsewhere in Canada, advocacy for travel service organizations and professional certification for individuals is provided by the <span class="glossary-term">Association of Canadian Travel Agencies (ACTA)</span>. ACTA is an industry-led, membership-based organization that aims to ensure customers have professional and meaningful counselling. Membership is optional, but it does offer the benefit of ensuring customers receive the required services and that the travel agencies have a membership board for reference and industry resources (ACTA, 2020b).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Travelcuts Travel Agency</strong></p> <div><p>Travelcuts is 100% Canadian owned and operated. As a student, you may have seen its locations on or around campus. With a primary audience of post-secondary students, professors, and alumni, Travel CUTS specializes in backpack-style travel to a variety of destinations. It is a full-service travel agency that can help find flights for travel, book tours with a variety of companies including GAdventures or Intrepid Travel, assist in booking hostels or hotels, and even help with a “Live and Work Abroad” program. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.travelcuts.com" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.travelcuts.com">Travelcuts website</a>.</p> </div> </div> <p>Although travel agencies may be located in a specific community, the agencies and their representatives may operate internationally, within Canada, within BC, or across regions. In Vancouver alone there are over 650 travel agencies available to the searching traveller (Travel Agents in BC, 2020). Examples of some of the more recognized larger travel agencies and agents operating in BC include the British Columbia Automobile Association (BCAA), Marlin Travel, and Flight Centre.</p> <h1>Tour Operators</h1> <p>Many different types of <span class="glossary-term">tour operators</span> work across BC and Canada. Tour operators can specialize in any sector or a combination of sectors. A company&nbsp;may focus on ski experiences, as is the case with Destination Snow,&nbsp;or perhaps wine tours in the Okanagan, which is the specialty of&nbsp;Distinctly Kelowna Tours. These operators specialize in one area but there are others that&nbsp;work with many different service providers.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Canadian Association of Tour Operators </strong></p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">Canadian Association of Tour Operators (CATO)</span> is a membership-based organization that serves as the voice of the tour operator segment and engages in professional development&nbsp;and networking in the sector.

An example of a niche BC tour operator is Prince of Whales Whale Watching in Victoria. Prince of Whales offers specialty whale-watching tours year-round in a variety of boat sizes, working with the local DMO and other local booking agents to sell tours as part of packages or as a stand-alone service to travellers. It also works to sell its product directly to the potential traveller through its website, reservation number, and in-person sales agents (Prince of Whales, 2020).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1615" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1615" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1613" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria.jpg" alt="Close-up of three killer whales swimming a few hundred metres from the shore." width="500" height="329" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-300x198.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-1024x675.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-768x506.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-1536x1012.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-225x148.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Whales-Off-Victoria-350x231.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1615">Figure 7.5 Whales off of Victoria, B.C.</div></div> <p>An example of a large <span class="glossary-term">RTO</span> representing Canada is Jonview. Operators of all kinds frequently work closely with a number of destination marketing organizations, as evidenced during <span class="glossary-term">Canada’s West Marketplace</span>, which is a trade marketplace hosted by Destination BC and Travel Alberta.&nbsp;Each year the location of the marketplace alternates between Alberta and BC (past locations have included Kelowna and Canmore). This event provides an opportunity for Alberta and BC sellers (tour operators, local accommodation, activities, and <span class="glossary-term">DMOs</span>) to sell their products to international RTOs who in turn work with international tour operators and travel agents to repackage the travel products. In a span of 10-minute sessions, sellers market and promote their products in hopes of having an RTO pick up the package for future years.</p> <p>On a national scale, Rendez-vous Canada is a tourism marketplace presented by the Destination Canada (formally the Canadian Tourism Commission) that brings together more than 1,500 tourism professionals from around the world for a series of 12- minute sessions where they can learn more about Canadian tours and related services (Canadian Tourism Commission, 2020).</p> <p>Let’s now look a little closer at the role of BC destination marketing organizations (DMOs) in providing travel services.</p> <h1>Destination Marketing Organizations</h1> <p>At the national level, Destination Canada is responsible for strategic marketing of the country. It works with industry and government while providing resources for small and medium-sized businesses in the form of toolkits. In BC, there a variety of travel service providers available to help with the planning process including Destination BC/<span class="glossary-term">HelloBC</span>, <span class="glossary-term">regional destination marketing organizations (RDMOs)</span>, and local <span class="glossary-term">DMOs</span>.</p> <h2>Destination BC/HelloBC</h2> <p><span class="glossary-term">HelloBC</span> is the official travel service platform of Destination BC, British Columbia’s provincial DMO. HelloBC.com offers access to festival activities, accommodation, transportation options, and trip ideas. This website is complemented by a social media presence on TripAdvisors (HelloBC, 2014a).</p> <p>To assist with trip planning, <span class="glossary-term">HelloBC</span> features&nbsp;a booking agent system, offering discounts and special deals&nbsp;created in partnership with operators. Although the site can process these value-added components,&nbsp;it does not handle&nbsp;accommodation bookings, instead directing the interested party to the reservation system of a chosen provider.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1615" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1614" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="533" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Visitor-Information-350x467.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7.6 Cyclists make a stop at a Visitor Centre, identifiable by its distinctive blue and yellow logo.</div></div> <p>In addition to operating <span class="glossary-term">HelloBC</span>, <span class="glossary-term">Destination BC</span> also oversees a network of 136 Visitor Centres that can be identified by the blue and yellow logo.

Travel services typically offered&nbsp;include&nbsp;hotel search engines, specific destination packages and offers, discounts, events and festival listings, and other information of interest to potential visitors. In the absence of a CDMO, sometimes these services are provided by the local chamber of commerce or economic development office.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Tourism Tofino&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>Tourism Tofino is the local DMO for the Tofino area, located on the west side of Vancouver Island. Tofino is a destination region that attracts travellers to Pacific Rim National Park, surfing opportunities, storm watching, and the Pacific Ocean. As part of its marketing tactics, Tourism Tofino offers visitors key planning tools on the landing site. To encourage shoulder season visitation, storm-watching deals are highlighted, which also allows visitors to inquire directly with the accommodation provider and/or tour operator. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.tourismtofino.com" data-url="http://www.tourismtofino.com">Tourism Tofino website</a>.</p> </div> <p>Complementing BC’s Visitor Centre network mentioned earlier, local visitor centres are managed by individual communities. <span class="glossary-term">Visitor centres</span> may be housed in gateway buildings at strategic locations, in historic or cultural buildings, or at an office located in town.</p> <h1>Other Systems and Organizations</h1> <p>A number of customized and targeted reservation systems are used by BC DMOs and other organizations. One example is the BC campground reservation online booking systems. BC Parks, Parks Canada,&nbsp;and private campground operators all use different proprietary reservation systems. Both <a href="https://www.discovercamping.ca/bccweb/" data-url="https://www.discovercamping.ca/bccweb/">BC Parks reservations</a> and <a href="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/voyage-travel/reserve" data-url="https://www.pc.gc.ca/en/voyage-travel/reserve">Parks Canada reservations</a> open on a specific date in the spring for bookings later in the year. These systems let visitors review what a site looks like through photos or video and pick which site they would like to book in the campground. Many campgrounds also offer a first-come-first-served system, as well as overflow sites, to accommodate visitors who may not have reserved a site.</p> <p>In the business market, there are several companies in BC and Canada that facilitate planning and booking. SAP Concur is an example of a expense management company widely used in British Columbia and Canada by organizations including CIBC, Kellogg’s, and Pentax. It provides services including efficiency software for use by employees, expense and invoicing software for use by managers, and a mobile application that ensures clients can take the technology on the go. Its services have contributed to client savings, such as reducing the travel expenses (Concur, 2020).</p> <p>So far we’ve looked at travel services as defined by go2HR and NAICS.

In BC, an organization called go2HR serves to educate employers on attracting, training, and retaining employees, as well as hosts a tourism job board to match prospective employees with job options in tourism around the province.</p> <h1>Training Providers</h1> <p>Throughout this textbook, you’ll see examples of not-for-profit industry associations that provide&nbsp;training and certification for industry professionals. For example, the Association of Canadian Travel Agents offers a full-time and distance program to train for the occupation of certified travel counsellor.

Training options at these colleges and universities include certificates, diplomas, degrees and masters-level programs in adventure tourism, outdoor recreation, hospitality management, and tourism management. For example, whether students are learning how to manage a restaurant at Camosun College, gaining mountain adventure skills at College of the Rockies, or exploring the world of outdoor recreation and tourism management at the University of Northern BC, tomorrow’s workforce is being prepared by skilled instructors with solid industry experience.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Emerit</strong></p> <p>Emerit is Canada’s award winning training resource developed by Tourism HR Canada in collaboration with tourism industry professionals from across Canada.

Many tourism services organizations are not-for-profit entities that rely on membership dues, donations, grants, and government funding to survive. As the economic climate becomes strained and budgets are tightened, all groups are increasingly forced to demonstrate return on investment to stakeholders. As some of the benefits of travel services are difficult to define, groups must innovate and articulate or face extinction.</p> <p>The challenge of budget constraints came to life in late 2014 when Destination BC announced it was shutting down its Visitor Centres at Vancouver International Airport and reviewing five other gateway locations including Peace Arch and Golden. While the airport locations welcomed over 180,000 visitors per year, analysis performed by Destination BC showed guests were asking non-tourism questions, and the centres’ value was questioned. Closing the centres at the airport, it was determined,&nbsp;would save $500,000 per year — but some in the industry were left wondering why they weren’t consulted prior to the announcement&nbsp;(Smyth, 2014).</p> <h1>Technology</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_814" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-814" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-814" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard.jpg" alt="A smartphone lies face up on a laptop keyboard." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-768x513.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Smartphone-on-the-laptop-keyboard-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-814">Figure 7.9 Tablets, laptops, and mobile phones put reservations and booking options at the traveller’s fingertips.</div></div> <p>As discussed earlier, online travel agencies have revolutionized the sector in a short span of time.

The interaction between humans and technology have “become more natural, contextual, and ubiquitous” and are constantly being enhanced in more ways than one (Deloitte Development LLC, 2019). Keeping in mind that travel services pertain to the planning and reserving of trip components, recent beneficial technological improvements include the following (Orfutt, 2013):</p> <ul><li>Real-time and automated inventory management, ensuring operators and travellers alike are working with accurate information when planning and booking</li> <li>A pollution and weather detection chip that would help tour operators, transportation providers, and visitors anticipate, and plan for changes in conditions</li> <li>Personalized information presented to visitors to help them narrow their choices in the trip planning process, ensuring users are not overwhelmed with information, and making the most of limited screen size on mobile devices and tablets</li> <li>Social technologies and on-the-go information sharing, allowing users to plan at the last minute as they travel</li> <li>Virtual assistant holograms and tablets carrying information that can replace humans during the travel experience (for instance, at airport arrivals and visitor centres)</li> <li>The technical expansion of the internet into the Internet of Things (IoT), and</li> <li>The use of automated systems and robotics that provide services for the traveller.</li> </ul> <p>These innovations will continue to increase as more advances are made and industry blends technology and travel experiences.

The tools they use to research and book these experiences are constantly changing due to innovations in technology. Destinations are also challenged by limited financial resources and strong competition for tourist dollars from other iconic and even lesser known locations. The personalisation of travel suggests that independent travel will have a stronger presence than group travel, however, we must always consider the type of traveller. The travel services sector is being forced to innovate at a startling rate.</p> <p>In the past, face to face consultations with a travel agent was paramount for booking both leisure and business travel. Technology and global circumstances, such as pandemics, financial collapses, and terrorism, have put pressure on tourism and travel services. With the development of OTAs and emerging and disruptive technologies, the travel services landscape is constantly changing.</p> <p>So far we have discussed the elements of the five sectors of tourism: transportation, accommodation, food and beverage, recreation and entertainment, and travel services. With this foundation in place, let’s delve deeper into the industry by learning more about how these sectors are promoted to customers in <a class="internal" href="#part-services-marketing" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/services-marketing/">Chapter 8</a> on services marketing.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Skiplagged helped users find less expensive flights by uncovering “hidden city” tickets. These are flights with stopovers in multiple locations, whereby the passenger gets off at one of the stopover cities rather than the final destination (Harris and Sasso, 2014). Hidden city tickets work when the cost to travel from point A to point B to point C is less expensive than a trip from point A to point B. Passengers book the entire flight but get off at the stopover. This practice is generally forbidden by airlines because of safety concerns and challenges to logistics as it renders passenger counts inaccurate, causing potential delays and fuel miscalculations. If discovered, it can result in a passenger having his or her ticket voided.</p> <p>The lawsuit against Skiplagged founder Aktarer Zaman stated that the site “intentionally and maliciously … [promoted] prohibited forms of travel” (Harris and Sasso, 2014). Orbitz (an OTA) and United Airlines claimed that Zaman’s website unfairly competed with their business, while making it appear these companies were partners and endorsing the activity by linking to their websites.</p> <p>Based on this case summary, answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>What are the dangers and inconveniences of having passengers deplane partway through a voyage? In addition to those listed here, come up with two more.</li> <li>Could this&nbsp;lawsuit and the ensuing publicity result in unintended negative consequences for United and Orbitz? What might these be?</li> <li>On the other hand, could the suit have&nbsp;unintended positive results for Skiplagged.com? Try to name at least three.</li> <li>Should Zaman be held responsible for facilitating this type of travel already in practice? Or should passengers bear the responsibility? Why or why not?</li> <li>Imagine your flight is delayed because a passenger count is inaccurate and fuel must be recalculated. What action would you take, if any?</li> <li>Look up the case to see what updates are available (<em>United Airlines Inc. v. Zaman</em>, 14-cv-9214, U.S. District Court, Northern District of Illinois (Chicago). Was the outcome what you predicted? Why or why not?</li> </ol> </div> </div> <h1>References</h1> <p class="hanging-indent">ACTA (2020a). <a class="internal" href="http://acta.ca/membership" data-url="http://acta.ca/membership">Membership</a>.

According to Morrison (2010), <span class="glossary-term">services marketing</span> “is a concept based on a recognition of the uniqueness of all services; it is a branch of marketing that specifically applies to the service industries” (p. 767). In general, the aims of marketing are to “create value for customers,” “build strong relationships” and “capture value from customers in return” (Kotler, Armstrong, Trifts, &amp; Cunningham, 2014, p. 2).</span></p> <p>Marketing in the tourism and hospitality industry requires an understanding of the differences between marketing goods, services, and experiences. To be successful in tourism marketing, organizations need to understand the unique characteristics of their tourism experiences, the motivations and behaviours of travelling consumers, and the fundamental differences between marketing goods, services, and experiences.</p> <p>Until the 1930s, the primary objective of businesses was manufacturing, with little thought given&nbsp;to sales or marketing. In&nbsp;the 1930s, a focus on sales became more important; technological advances meant that multiple companies could produce similar goods, creating increased competition. Even as companies began to understand the importance of sales, the&nbsp;needs and wants of the customer remained a&nbsp;secondary consideration (Morrison, 2010).</p> <p>In 1944, the first television commercial, for Bulova watches, reached 4,000 sets (Davis, 2013). The decades that followed, the&nbsp;1950s and 1960s, are&nbsp;known as an era when marketing began to truly take off, with the number of mediums expanding and TV ad spending going from 5% of total TV revenues in 1953 to 15% just one year later (Davis, 2013).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1627" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-821" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Peter-Max-Don’t-Smoke-Cigarettes.jpg#fixme#fixme" alt="A colourful abstract poster that says, &amp;quot;Life is so beautiful.

Customers had more choice in product, which required companies to shift focus to ensure that consumers knew how their products matched specific needs. This was also the time when quality of service and customer satisfaction became part of organizational strategy. We began to see companies develop internal marketing departments, and in the 1960s, the first full-service advertising agencies began to emerge.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Societal marketing</span> emerged in the 1970s when organizations began to recognize their place in society and their responsibility to citizens (or at least the appearance thereof). This change is demonstrated, for example, by natural resource extraction companies&nbsp;supporting environmental management issues and implementing more transparent&nbsp;policies. This decade saw the emergence of media we are familiar with today (the first hand-held mobile phone was launched in 1973) and the decline of traditional marketing through vehicles such&nbsp;as print; the latter evidenced by the closure of <em>LIFE Magazine</em> in 1972 amid complaints that TV advertising was too difficult to compete with (Davis, 2013).</p> <p>The 1990s ushered in the start of the online marketing era. <span class="glossary-term">E-commerce</span> (electronic commerce) revolutionized every industry, perhaps impacting the travel industry most of all. Tourism and hospitality service providers began making use of this technology to optimize marketing to consumers; manage reservations; facilitate transactions; partner and package itineraries; provide (multiple) customer feedback channels; collect, mine, analyze, and sell data; and automate functions. The marketing opportunities of this era appeared limitless and paved the way for the maturation of social media marketing and a number of other marketing shifts including the increased use of big data, mobile technology, and short- and long-form video content in marketing, as well as a more empowered and engaged consumer.

Some in the industry attribute this to the traditional career path in the tourism and hospitality industry where managers and executives worked their way up the ranks (e.g., from bellhop to general manager) rather than through a post-secondary business education that is more the norm today. It was previously commonly believed that to be a leader in this industry one had to understand the operations inside-out, so training and development of managers was based on technical and functional capabilities, rather than marketing savvy. And, as we’ll learn next, marketing services and experiences is distinct and sometimes more challenging than marketing goods. For these reasons, most businesses in the industry have been developing marketing skills for only about 30 years (Morrison, 2010).</p> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="fig8.1">Figure 8.1 long description:</strong> A black-and-white advertisement.

According to numerous scholars (cited in Lovelock &amp; Patterson, 2015) services are:</p> <ol><li><span class="glossary-term">Intangible</span></li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Heterogeneous</span></li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Inseparable</span></li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Perishable</span></li> </ol> <p>The rest of this section details what these concepts mean.</p> <h1>Intangibility</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Tangible</span> goods are ones the customer can see, feel, and/or taste ahead of payment. <span class="glossary-term">Intangible</span> services, on the other hand, cannot be “touched” beforehand. An airplane flight is an example of an intangible service because a customer purchases it in advance and doesn’t “experience” or “consume” the product until he or she is on the plane.</p> <h1>Heterogeneity</h1> <p>While most goods may be replicated identically, services are never&nbsp;exactly the same; they are <span class="glossary-term">heterogeneous</span>. Variability in experiences may be caused by location, time, topography, season, the environment, amenities, events, and service providers. Because human beings factor so largely in the provision of services, the quality and level of service may differ between vendors or may even be inconsistent within one provider. We will discuss quality and level of service further in Chapter 9.</p> <h1>Inseparability</h1> <p>A physical good may last for an extended period of time (in some cases for many years). In contrast, a service is produced and consumed at the same time. A service exists only at the moment or during the period in which a person is engaged and immersed in the experience. When dining out at a restaurant, for instance, the food is typically prepared, served, and consumed on site, except in cases where customers utilize takeout or food courier options such as Skip the Dishes.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1631" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1631" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight.jpg" alt="Rows and rows of empty airplane seats." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Empty-Flight-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8.4 These empty seats represent lost revenue for the airline.</div></div> <h1>Perishability</h1> <p>Services and experiences cannot be stored; they are highly <span class="glossary-term">perishable</span>.

Sometimes a potential visitor or guest is bombarded with messaging about independent destinations within a region, or businesses within a city, rather than one consistent set of messages about the core attributes of that destination.</p> <p>It is important to consider how consumers use various and multiple channels of communication and reach out to them in a comprehensive and coherent fashion. As a concept, <span class="glossary-term">IMC</span> is not new, but it is more challenging than ever due to the numerous social media and unconventional communication channels now available. Each channel must be well maintained and aligned around the same messages, and selected with the visitor in mind. Too often businesses and destinations deploy multiple channels and end up neglecting some of these, rather than ensuring key platforms are well maintained (Eliason, 2014).</p> <p>In order to better understand our guests, and the best ways to reach them, let’s&nbsp;take a closer look at the consumer as the starting and focal point of any marketing plan.</p> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="fig8.5">Figure 8.5 long description:</strong> The services marketing triangle.

Potential travellers and guests will respond, in varying degrees, to traditional channels and emerging online communications tools. There are many choices in marketing and communication channels, each with strengths and weaknesses. Determining the right mix, frequency, and message depends heavily on establishing objectives, completing research, performing a situational analysis, and creating a positioning approach&nbsp;(Morrison, 2010). Let’s take a closer look at communications channels that may form part of the marketing mix.</p> <h1>Traditional Channels</h1> <h2>Mass Media</h2> <p><span class="glossary-term">Mass media</span> is best described as the use of channels that reach very large markets. Examples include national newspapers and&nbsp;radio or television advertising. The immediate advantage of using mass media is the ability to reach multiple target markets in significant numbers. Disadvantages include the high expense and&nbsp;difficulty in effective target marketing and measuring return.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1646" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1646" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1644" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain.jpg" alt="An ad for skiing, saying, &amp;quot;You deserve a little après-work.&amp;quot;" width="500" height="281" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-300x169.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-768x432.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-65x37.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-225x127.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Out-of-Home-Advertising-for-Grouse-Mountain-350x197.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1646">Figure 8.11 This is an out-of-home ad for Grouse Mountain, in a downtown Vancouver rapid transit station, targeting people working in the area.

OOH advertising plays an important role in the tourism and hospitality industry as it provides an opportunity to inform travellers in unfamiliar territory. Transit advertising includes airports, rail, and taxi displays. Alternative outdoor refers to arenas, stadiums, and digital media. Street furniture includes bus shelters, kiosks, and shopping malls.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><strong>Take a Closer Look: Tourism Business Essentials: <em>Travel Media Relations Guide</em><br /> </strong>Travel journalists, freelance writers, social influencers, editors, and broadcasters play an important role in ensuring a destination is well represented in the press.

Consumers are being offered this transportation option next to the hotel booking info.</div></div> <p>As discussed in <a class="internal" href="#part-travel-services" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/travel-services/">Chapter 7</a>, the internet is nearly twice as important as travel agents as an information source for travel (Deloitte, 2015). There are an estimated 4.5 billion people around the globe with internet access, and social media has become truly integrated into the travel and hospitality industry. TripAdvisor and similar sites have become the customer’s first point of connection with tourism and hospitality products and experiences. This can be both an opportunity and a threat: an opportunity to open the channels of communication, but a threat if negative information about the travel or hospitality organization is widely spread. As online distribution expands, empowered and savvy travellers are unbundling the booking component and self-booking directly (Deloitte, 2015).</p> <p>Internet and mobile technology are referred to as <span class="glossary-term">interactive media</span>. For tourism and hospitality businesses, an online presence is crucial: it’s cost effective, it provides global reach, it allows a business to be available 24/7, and it provides a reciprocal communication platform for customers. An online presence can also produce instant access to critical consumer data such as click through rates on websites, views of social media posts and pages, paths-to-purchase, and much more.</p> <h2>Social&nbsp;Media and Reputation Management</h2> <p>There are also challenges with online marketing, including being noticed within the volume of information customers are exposed to, and loss of control in delivering a message. Despite these challenges, as more consumers seek real-time information online, tourism marketers are responding with increasingly sophisticated online marketing strategies, such as search engine optimization, personalized content, and social media monitoring and analytics.</p> <h3>Social Media</h3> <p><span class="glossary-term">Social media</span> is a broad term that refers to web-based and mobile applications used for social interaction and the exchange of content (Zheng &amp; Gerritsen, 2014). Social networking is the act of using social media to “communicate directly with people you’re already connected to or with whom you wish to be connected with” (Zheng &amp; Gerritsen, 2014, p. 28). Unlike traditional media such as newspapers, magazines, and television, social media is largely powered by user-generated content. This refers to content created and shared by consumers rather than by marketers, journalists, experts, and other paid professionals, although they too contribute to social networks. <span class="glossary-term">Influencers</span> also play a major role in generating content and hype about tourism products, services, and experiences, ultimately affecting consumer purchasing decisions. Tourism marketers are increasingly leveraging influencer authority, knowledge, and relationships to reach and capture new markets.</p> <h3>Word of Mouth in the Age of Social Media</h3> <p>Social networking has transformed how many people interact with businesses and share experiences with others, in a communication channel known as electronic <span class="glossary-term">word of mouth</span> where customers share directly with each other in an online environment. Consumers now have a variety of channels (e.g., Twitter, Instagram, Facebook) and formats (e.g., videos, blogs, reviews) on which to leave ratings, express preferences, and share stories. Many of these platforms have large audiences, and much of this commentary is made in real time, on a smartphone, while the customer is still in the business.</p> <h3>Advertising&nbsp;and Trust</h3> <p>Social networks, and review sites in particular, are used more and more to seek information and advice on things to do and products and services to purchase. Travellers and locals alike check out these sites for ideas on where to stay, eat, relax, shop, and explore. These channels are highly trusted. A survey of over 28,000 consumers in 56 countries found that consumers trust the advice of people they know (92%) and consumer opinions posted online (70%) more than any other advertising source (Nielsen, 2012). A more recent survey of over 31,000 consumers in 36 countries confirmed that personal recommendations and internet sties are the most important planning sources for travellers (Skift, 2014).</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

A 2019 survey by BrightLocal found that 92% of consumers made decisions based on online reviews and 76% trusted online reviews as much as personal recommendations (BrightLocal, 2019). A 2011 study conducted by Harvard Business School found that, for independent restaurants, a one-star increase in Yelp ratings led to a 5% to 9% increase in revenue (Luca, 2011). According to a study by the Cornell Center for Hospitality Research, if a hotel increases its review score on Travelocity by 1 point on a 5-point scale, it can raise its price by 11.2% without affecting demand (Anderson, 2012). Finally, a report published by TripAdvisor and Oxford Economics claims that TripAdvisor was responsible for $US 546 billion in traveller spending in 2017 alone (Tourism Economics, 2020).</p> <h1>Understanding Customer Needs</h1> <p>As we have discussed, service plays an important role in shaping customer impressions, where the ultimate goal of a tourism or hospitality business is to exceed expectations.&nbsp;Every customer has different wants and needs, but virtually all customers expect the following basic needs to be taken care of:</p> <ul><li>Quality</li> <li>Value</li> <li>Convenience</li> <li>Good service</li> </ul> <p>To fully satisfy customers, businesses must deliver in all four areas. If they&nbsp;meet the basic needs listed above, they’ll create a&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">passive customer</span> — one who is satisfied, but not likely to write a review or mention a&nbsp;business to others.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1646" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1646" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin.jpg" alt="A woman makes a disgusted face and points to a messy pine wreath." width="500" height="386" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin.jpg 2047w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-300x232.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-1024x791.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-768x593.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-1536x1186.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-65x50.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-225x174.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Wreath-makin-350x270.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 8.13 This unhappy customer is likely to broadcast news of her bad experience across multiple platforms.</div></div> <p>On the other hand, failure to deliver on the promise can result in a disappointed customer undoing all the efforts of the marketing plan.

As we learned in the last chapter, this provincial <span class="glossary-term">destination marketing organization</span> has been mandated to fulfill several key marketing and leadership responsibilities critical to the long-term sustainable growth of the provincial tourism industry. This includes marketing British Columbia domestically, nationally, and internationally as a tourist destination (Destination BC, 2020a). Destination BC’s 2020–2023 corporate strategy articulates its aspiration to share the transformative power of BC experiences with the world by focusing on key markets, paths to purchase, visitor dispersion, and key partnerships (Destination BC, 2020b).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Online Reputation Management </strong></p> <p>This guide from Destination BC’s Tourism Business Essentials series helps businesses understand how to manage their online reputation and includes tips for responding to reviews and other best practice.

Marketing activities to these areas are led by the regions, communities, and/or sectors such as ski. <span class="glossary-term">Top priority markets</span> of Ontario, California, Germany, Japan, United Kingdom, South Korea, and Australia are characterized by high revenue and high spending per visitor. Marketing efforts here are led by Destination BC. <span class="glossary-term">Emerging markets</span>, which include China, India, and Mexico, are monitored and explored by Destination BC.</p> <h3>Performance Measurement and Evaluation</h3> <p>In order to measure its success in the realm of destination marketing, Destination BC has introduced a tool called the&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">net promoter score (NPS)</span>,&nbsp;a metric designed to monitor customer engagement. The NPS indicates the likelihood of&nbsp;travellers recommending a destination to friends, family, or colleagues. <span class="glossary-term">NPS</span> is based on responses to the question, How likely are you to recommend [British Columbia] as a travel destination to a friend, family member, or colleague? Responses are scored from 0 = “not at all likely” to 10 = “extremely likely.” Respondents are divided into three categories:</p> <ul><li>Detractors&nbsp;(scores of 0 to 6): Unhappy visitors, unlikely to tell others to visit and might even damage the reputation of a destination through negative word of mouth</li> <li>Passives&nbsp;(scores of 7 or 8): Marginally satisfied visitors not excited enough to tell others about their travel experience</li> <li>Promoters&nbsp;(scores of 9 or 10): Loyal enthusiasts likely to return and rave about their travel experience</li> </ul> <p>NPS is calculated by subtracting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters: NPS = % of detractors&nbsp;— % of supporters. The intention to recommend a travel destination, reported by the NPS, is a proxy measure of overall satisfaction with the travel experience.&nbsp;Satisfaction with the travel experience and the intention to recommend greatly increase the likelihood of a return visit to British Columbia.&nbsp;And word-of-mouth advocacy, either face-to-face or through social media, is critical for attracting first-time visitors to British Columbia.</p> <p>Destination BC uses NPS as a performance measurement tool (among others) to help determine the overall effectiveness of online and integrated marketing communications strategies (Destination BC, 2020c). Furthermore, Destination BC has developed the Remarkable Experiences program to “shift thinking beyond a tourism product to consider how a business can deliver local, authentic experiences that are designed with the BC traveller in mind” (Destination BC, 2020d).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Indigenous Tourism BC<br /> </strong></p> <p>As cited on their website: <span class="glossary-term">Indigenous Tourism BC (ITBC)</span> honours the value of Indigenous knowledge in tourism. More than 200 distinct Indigenous communities, with more than 30 living languages, offer unique perspectives and thriving Indigenous businesses ready to host visitors in major urban centres, down fast rivers, before hereditary totem poles, in award-winning cafes and restaurants, and on pristine beaches under the stars. Indigenous tourism hosts in British Columbia invite visitors to come and share their love for this land. Recognizing that indigenous tourism experiences are a primary draw for many visitors, ITBC aims to grow this industry in a “sustainable, authentic, and culturally rich” way.

A quick look at their marketing mix offers some answers:</p> <ul><li>Product:&nbsp;The inn has long been a leader in offering experiences that&nbsp;go above and beyond&nbsp;a room in a luxury hotel, starting with their storm-watching packages in the late fall, a time that was once their&nbsp;off-season.</li> <li>Place: Reservations can be made online on the inn’s website, via a toll-free number, through OTA sites including TripAdvisor (where reviews are constantly monitored in order to engage with customers), and other reservation services including the HelloBC program. The staff constantly engages with, and monitors their customers, tracking&nbsp;trends in traveller purchasing behaviour to ensure it is front and centre with the inn’s target markets.</li> <li>Promotion: The inn has a well-maintained, visually rich website and social media presence on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Google+, and Flickr (a presence that&nbsp;shifts constantly depending on where consumers can be found online). Its site features a media page with blogs, press releases, and high-resolution photos and videos to ensure journalists can easily post a story at any time.</li> <li>Pricing: The inn has a&nbsp;comprehensive revenue management and pricing plan that includes packaging and promotions for all seasons. The pricing reflects offering value to guests, while confidently staying at the higher end of the scale.</li> <li>People:&nbsp;Not only does the inn attract and train staff who deliver on its promise of exceptional experiences, the Wick also has&nbsp;a multi-person team responsible for sales, marketing, and media (blogging, press releases, photography, hosting familiarization tours).</li> <li>Programming: Programs include packaging under themes such as elopement, natural, seasonal, romantic, spa, and culinary. Many packages include the involvement of hotel personnel such as an elopement coordinator or concierge to help guests plan specific value-added and memorable components of their experience, such as a last-minute wedding (Wickaninnish Inn, 2020).</li> <li>Partnership: The Wick partners with other experience providers and events such as the Tofino Saltwater Classic — a fishing tournament hosted by Brendan Morrison of the Vancouver Canucks. By supporting the event as a platinum sponsor (Tofino Saltwater Classic, 2020), the representatives from the inn meet new potential guests and solidifies its place in the community.</li> <li>Physical evidence: In addition to <span class="glossary-term">familiarization tours</span>, the media team ensures the inn is considered for a number of high-profile awards, and celebrates wins by broadcasting these as they occur (e.g., Travel and Leisure Awards World’s Best Winner 2014). Prize logos are placed on the inn’s home page online, in print ads, and in physical locations on the property. The inn also has a regular consumer newsletter that celebrates achievements and shares promotions with past and future guests.</li> </ul> <p>Thinking about this example, answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Imagine the inn received a review on TripAdvisor that showed a customer was not satisfied. How might it deal with this?</li> <li>Visit the <a href="https://www.wickinn.com/" data-url="https://www.wickinn.com/">Wickaninnish Inn’s website</a>. Who are the target customers? How is this conveyed on the site?</li> <li>What are the prices for packages and accommodations? What does the price signal to you about the experience you might have at this hotel?</li> <li>Do an online search for “Wick Inn” using your favourite search engine. What are the first five links that come up? How do these present the property? What hand does the inn’s staff have in these results?</li> <li>Look at the community of Tofino as it is presented online and name five potential partners for the Wick.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Case Study 2: Crisis Communication</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>Destination BC has faced its fair share of marketing challenges over the years including an ongoing homelessness crisis, devastating fires and, in 2020, the novel coronavirus pandemic. What can we learn about how they respond(ed) to these crises and communicate(d) with their range of stakeholders? The service marketing triangle can be a useful tool to examine Destination BCs response to the coronavirus pandemic:</p> <ul><li>Internal marketing: Destination BC, in tandem with regional DMOs, provided regular bulletins, up-to-date website content, 24-hour email and call center assistance, live webinars and more to help industry partners access provincial and federal resources and align their consumer-facing messaging with provincial and federal travel guidelines.</li> <li>External marketing: In the early stages of the pandemic, Destination BC worked with provincial health authorities and regional DMOs, to leverage social media such as Twitter to send simple, clear messages directly to visitors and residents. For example, in March 2020, at the height of the crisis, they released messages with the hashtag: #ExploreBCLater… In early May 2020, as provincial restrictions lessened, they released messages with the hashtag: #ExploreBCLocal… And, as restrictions continued to lift in late May 2020, they revived a staple hashtag: #BCTourismMatters.</li> <li>Interactive marketing: Industry partners did their part by making the difficult decision to close their doors to visitors or operate in alignment with the provincial health guidelines. For example, Butchart Gardens provided a COVID-19 update on their website reminding visitors to enjoy the beauty of the gardens while maintaining appropriate physical distance (2m), following directional arrows on pathways, and listening to staff. Though regularly changing, these guidelines at time of publication can be found on the <a href="http://www.butchartgardens.com" data-url="http://www.butchartgardens.com">Butchart Gardens’ website</a>.</li> </ul> <p>Thinking about this example, answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Analyze Destination BCs response. What did they do well and what could they have done differently during this particular crisis, or others?</li> <li>How did Did Destination BC use various communication channels to create, enable, and deliver on their promise to keep people safe and businesses solvent during the coronavirus pandemic?</li> <li>Visit California had a series of devastating fires in the late 2010s. Even though 99% of California’s wine country was still intact during a good portion of this time, the press was sending out the message that “Wine Country” had become “Fire Country”. What role does the media have on visitor perceptions of destinations?</li> <li>Look for examples online of how Visit California, like Destination BC, may have utilized the services marketing triangle to control the media narrative and deliver on its promise of safe and secure travel. As a starting point, you might look at Visit California’s Grateful Table experience, Share the Love video, Power of Love public service announcement, or <a href="http://www.westcoasttravelfacts.org" data-url="http://www.westcoasttravelfacts.org">West Coast Travel Facts</a> to answer this question.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <h1>References</h1> <p class="hanging-indent">Anderson, C.

We will interview experienced tourism professionals, as well study the success of BC’s own customer service program, SuperHost, which has been training BC hospitality professionals for over 35 years.</p> <p>We will be introducing concepts such as Total Quality (TQ), Net Promoter score and Customer lifetime value (CLV) used to measure customer service impact.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1659" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1658" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work.jpg" alt="A barista smiles with two customers and a child in a stroller." width="500" height="667" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work.jpg 1920w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-1536x2048.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Terence-at-Work-350x467.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1659">Figure 9.1 A family getting their regular drink at the local coffee shop, where they are provided with prompt and courteous service.</div></div> <p>Customer service delivery and experience in today’s economy is becoming increasingly significant owing to change in demographics and psychographics.

Sometimes it’s an intangible component of why a guest&nbsp;may prefer&nbsp;one tourism or hospitality provider&nbsp;over another. There is something about quality customer service that you often can’t put your finger on — but you know it’s there.&nbsp;And it’s&nbsp;a critical factor for tourism success, both as a means of satisfying ever-increasing customer expectations, and as a way to achieve business profitability (Erdly &amp; Kesterson-Townes, 2002).</p> <p>In 2019, A Forbes article from Blake identified that, “Companies with a customer experience mindset drive revenue 4-8% higher than the rest of their industries. Two-thirds of companies compete on customer experience, up from just 36% in 2010” (Blake, 2019).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Industry Conversation: Ben Day, Director of Sales and Marketing, Blackcomb Springs Suites by Clique</strong></p> <p><strong>In your own words, how you describe customer service?</strong></p> <p>Customer service for me is the discipline and some would say the art of the following…. Listening, Understanding, Delivering</p> <ul><li><strong>Listening</strong>: Find out by listening, asking questions and watching for non-verbal cues (i.e., body language) what kind of service your guest requires</li> <li><strong>Understanding</strong>: Once you have absorbed the verbal and non-verbal cues, takes a moment to understand what it is that the guest really wants and anticipate additional touches that will go above and beyond.</li> <li><strong>Delivering the service</strong>: The key to delivering great customer service is in the first two steps. By listening and understanding the guests you can anticipate the type of service that might just make a lasting impression. Sometimes great service is provided by empowering the guest to take action themselves, don’t assume your guest will want you to do everything for them. Some guest may prefer that you send them a link to a website or an app so that they research their options independently.</li> </ul> </div> <p>Training is critical to ensuring quality service and meeting these objectives (Brown et al., 2009). On a global scale, Canada ranks high in human resources capabilities. Unfortunately, due to the seasonal nature of many tourism and hospitality positions, and limited access to affordable and accessible training, the industry isn’t always able to take advantage of this position (Blanke &amp; Chiesa, 2009), as it can be difficult to attract, train, and retain reliable and qualified staff year-round.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Tourism HR Canada and go2HR</strong></p> <p>Tourism HR Canada is a pan-Canadian organization with a mandate aimed at building a world-leading tourism workforce.

NPS breaks down customers into groups based on how they answer a question similar to this:</p> <p>“On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend our company (or product) to a friend or colleague?”</p> <p>Based on the score they give you, they are sorted into Detractors (scores of 1–6), Passives or Neutral (scores of 7–8), or Promoters (scores of 9–10). Detractors can harm businesses.</p> <p>They are not only likely to not return, but they may also urge others to do the same (i.e., they will give bad reviews).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Passives</span> are satisfied. Satisfaction is desirable of course, but passives may or may not come back to a business. Passives are not likely to go out of their way to recommend the business (and also likely won’t complete a review).</p> <p><strong>Promoters</strong> are very satisfied or delighted customers. They can help your business — they come back repeatedly and will recommend your business to others. These are the people who give you 4 or 5 star ratings!<a class="internal" id="retfig9.4" href="" data-url=""></a></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1666" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1663" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Net-Promoter-Score.png" alt="Net promoter score scale.

An on-location problem that turns into an online complaint, going from private to public, can become far more damaging to business than the original issue. To avoid any problem from escalating, organizations and staff must work hard to resolve issues before the customer walks out the door — or pulls out a smartphone to make an online posting.</p> <p>Of course, it’s not always possible to resolve issues on the spot. A customer’s expectations may go beyond the service the business is able to provide, or staff might not be authorized by management to provide the means necessary to resolve the complaint. In these cases, staff must still step up as service professionals, realizing that the actions they take when faced with a complaint can have a significant impact.</p> <p>Online complaints highlight this point; reviewers are often more upset about how a problem was handled than about the problem itself. As well, potential guests who read online complaints are looking for reassurance that the same thing won’t happen to them. If they don’t find it, they may dismiss the business as an option and move on. How a business respond to complaints, face-to-face and online, is critical to ensuring successful recovery from service failures.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Service recovery</span> occurs when a customer service professional takes action that results in the customer being satisfied after a service failure has occurred. Often service failures are not the fault of front-line staff, and at times, may not even be the fault of the business. Failure may be the result of an error made by another employee, by the guest him- or herself, or by a technical error. Regardless of where the problem originated, when customers bring it to the attention of the staff, they have certain expectations for resolution.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1666" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1666" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act.jpg" alt="Tiles spell “understand, listen, act.”" width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Listen-Understand-Act-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 9.7 Listen, understand, act: the building blocks for resolving disputes.</div></div> <p>Disappointed customers often want:</p> <ul><li>An empathetic ear.

They are often paired with credit cards.</div></div> <p>With competition between tourism destinations and businesses continuing to grow, organizations are increasingly focusing on retaining existing customers, which is often less expensive than attracting new ones. This focus forces tourism businesses to look at the customer relationship over the long term, or the customer lifetime value (CLV) cycle, rather than at single transactions only.</p> <p>It has been proven that it is much less expensive for a company to retain an existing customer than acquire a new one (Beaujean, Davidson &amp; Madge, 2006). Ultimately, successful organizations will strive to build a base of loyal customers who will provide repeat business and may influence other potential customers. Building positive relationships with loyal customers requires planning and diligence for all customer touch points. This may include (Lovelock &amp; Wirtz, 2007):</p> <ol><li>Managing service encounters:&nbsp;training staff to provide personal service to customers</li> <li>Providing customer incentives: inducing customers to frequent the business</li> <li>Providing special service options: offering enhanced services or extra offerings to loyal customers</li> <li>Developing pricing strategies to encourage long-term use: offering repeat customers special prices or rate</li> <li>Maintaining a customer database: keeping an up-to-date set of records on customer purchase history, preferences, demographics, and so on.</li> <li>Communicating with customers: reaching individual customers through direct or specialized media, using non-mass media approaches</li> </ol> <p><span class="glossary-term">Loyalty programs</span> pull together several of these elements to help a business identify, maintain contact with, and reward frequent customers.</p> <h1>Examples of Outstanding Service</h1> <p>If one uses the definition of quality in service as “meeting or exceeding customer expectations” (Kapiki, 2012), then the following examples certainly fit the description. These embody a concept known as a&nbsp;moment of truth&nbsp;(Beaujean, Davidson &amp; Madge, 2006) when a customer’s interaction with a front-line employee makes a critical difference in his or her perception of that company or destination. The characteristics of employees that are best able to create these moments include self-empowerment and self-regulation, a positive outlook, awareness of their feelings and the feelings of others, and the ability to curb fear and anxiety while being able to access a desire to help others. These past winners of the&nbsp;WorldHost&nbsp;customer service award demonstrate this concept in action (WorldHost, n.d.):</p> <blockquote><p>Tamara Turcotte of the Sidney Airport Travelodge was nominated after she came into work on her day off after hearing that hundreds of&nbsp;travellers&nbsp;had been stranded after a bomb threat led to the cancellation of ferry trips from nearby Swartz Bay. Reporting for duty, she helped coordinate accommodations for these&nbsp;travellers, looking beyond the hotel (which was full) to the homes of coworkers and friends. Her compassion and swift actions helped turn a negative experience for these guests into a moment of truth about visiting British Columbia.</p> <p>Agazzi Abbay received word that JetsGo, a small airline and his employer, had suddenly gone out of business, and he was out of a job. Concerned for the passengers that would be stranded by this abrupt end for the airline, he went to the airport to give them the opportunity to share their frustration. Even though he was unable to help their situation, he was able to demonstrate empathy and provide a listening ear as the only former JetsGo employee available across Canada.</p> <p>Andrea Chan, a guest services supervisor at the Holiday Inn and Suites in Vancouver, received a call from a hotel guest who said she was ill. Concerned because the caller sounded disoriented, Andrea recommended a visit to the hospital. To be sure her guest was safe, Andrea accompanied her to the emergency room and stayed with her until her health and safety were assured — working well beyond the hours of her shift, and returning home the next morning. By treating every guest like family, Andrea created a lasting impression about Holiday Inn and its customer service value.</p></blockquote> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Loyalty-Cards-e1599667918757 </li></ul></div> </div></div>

Even when&nbsp;employees have positive attributes, it may not be enough to&nbsp;ensure&nbsp;positive customer engagements unless they are specifically trained toward&nbsp;customer orientation (Kim, 2008).</p> <h1>Customer Service and Competition: The Customer-Oriented Organization</h1> <p>According to Masberg and colleagues,&nbsp;“to the customer, only service may distinguish a business from its competition” (Masberg, Chase, &amp; Madlem, 2003, p. 19). While specific customer service jobs require different skills, building an overall customer-oriented organization may better meet customer expectations.&nbsp;One way to ensure quality service may be to encourage tourism and hospitality professionals to acquire&nbsp;industry certifications. Businesses can&nbsp;also choose to implement tools&nbsp;to determine customer satisfactions levels, such as the <span class="glossary-term">SERVQUAL</span> technique that compares customer perceptions of quality against customer expectations (Morrison, 2010).&nbsp;Under the SERVQUAL model, the five dimensions of&nbsp;service are:</p> <ol><li>Reliability:&nbsp;where the quality and level of service is consistent</li> <li>Assurance: knowledge and courtesy of staff and their ability to convey trust and confidence</li> <li>Tangibles: the organization’s physical facilities, equipment, and appearance of staff</li> <li>Empathy: the degree of caring, individualized attention that the organization’s staff provide to its customers</li> <li>Responsiveness: the willingness of staff to help customers and provide prompt service</li> </ol> <p>You can remember these five dimensions by using the acronym RATER. When these dimensions are consistently met, a company is well on its way to becoming customer oriented.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Skills BC</strong></p> <p>Skills Canada BC engages a rich network of educators, labour, industry and government partners to deliver its programs and host its annual Regional and Provincial Olympic-style competitions.

CRMs are tools used by businesses to select customers and maintain relationships with them to increase their lifetime value to the business.</p> <p>There are a number of points in time where this relationship is maintained. For example:</p> <ul><li>The first&nbsp;time potential guests visit a website and leave their email address to receive&nbsp;more information</li> <li>The moment a reservation is made and the company captures their personal details</li> <li>The in-person service encounters from the front desk to the parking lot</li> <li>Welcome notes, personalized menus, friendly hellos, and other touches throughout the&nbsp;interaction</li> <li>Background&nbsp;messages including clean&nbsp;facilities and equipment in good repair, pleasant decor and ambiance (flowers, etc.)</li> <li>Follow-up communications like a newsletter</li> <li>Further interactions on social media</li> </ul> <p>All of these touch points are opportunities to maintain strong relationships with customers and to increase the likelihood of positive word of mouth sharing.

The cost of a negative experience is higher — but so is the value of a positive experience. In fact, the opportunities of social media reviews and ratings far outweigh the risks.</p> <p>Businesses that take time to “listen” to social media are going to be more successful at leveraging the power of online interactions. These companies effectively read review sites such as TripAdvisor, Yelp, and others and respond to guest comments both good and bad.</p> <p>Many factors contribute to how people rate businesses, including value, quality, and convenience. More than anything, however, service influences customer impressions. Whereas a lapse in quality or convenience can be overcome with excellent service, it is especially challenging to overcome the effects of bad service.</p> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="fig9.9">Figure 9.9 long description:</strong> An online review of a hotel, dated June 25, 2020.

Prudent employees seek employers who value investment in training.</p> <p>We know there are a variety of ways to ensure quality of service and recover when things go wrong. A key factor&nbsp;of success&nbsp;is understanding that customers want to be listened to — they would like an apology, a solution, at times compensation, and often follow-up and reassurance. And when a complaint is expertly handled, the customer can be converted from a potential social media detractor to a loyal advocate for the business.</p> <p>Technology is working at a furious pace, and BC’s tourism and hospitality industry has worked to keep up with the latest opportunities. As a leader in customer service and a well-established international destination, now more than ever, BC’s tourism industry will pivot to ensure its continued success.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li>Welcome-to-Vancouver-2010 </li></ul></div> </div></div>

All Accent Inns have developed a reputation for their quality, reasonable rates, and excellent service. Guest and staff satisfaction are key components of their service culture&nbsp;to treat every guest like family. The team at Accent Inns put great effort into making every customer interaction memorable.</p> <p>In 2013, Accent Inns committed to incorporating customer service training at each property to be delivered by Accent Inns assistant general managers (AGMs). Core outcomes were to raise the level of service, empower front-line staff with the tools to exceed guest expectations, and strengthen the facilitation and coaching skills of the AGM team. Building on the business’s existing training culture and strong corporate values, WorldHost Training Services created a customized half-day program for the AGMs to use in their hotels.</p> <p>To prepare, the AGMs completed an experiential 1.5-day train-the-trainer session. An emphasis on coaching support and a team facilitation approach led many to gain confidence in this new role. One trainer excelled and was selected as the full-time trainer for Accent Inns. Working with the human resources team from Accent Inns, WorldHost also completed a needs analysis at each property to ensure staff had input into future training. Training continues to be developed and delivered internally.</p> <p>According to Kathy Gaudry, human resources manager for Accent Inns, “The WorldHost team was fantastic; they worked hard to ensure the training was completely relevant to our employees and our culture. The results were phenomenal — our junior leaders have acquired the skills they need to deliver training locally to their own teams — we couldn’t be happier.”</p> <p>Visit the <a href="http://www.accentinns.com" data-url="http://www.accentinns.com">Accent Inns website</a> and review the information to answer the following questions about their customer service culture:</p> <ol><li>What kind of experience do you expect by reading the website’s information and looking at the pictures?

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-history-of-environmental-stewardship" title="10.1 Definitions and Environmental Stewardship Ideas"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">52</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">10.1 Definitions and Environmental Stewardship Ideas</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>One of the main reasons people travel is to visit areas that are unspoiled, natural, beautiful, or unique in terms of their local environment. Unfortunately, through our actions either as tourism businesses or as visitors, we risk damaging the natural environments we depend on (Hardin, 1968; Williams &amp; Ponsford, 2008). Establishing management practices in tourism that limit harm and damage to the environment is a key priority for most tourism destinations. For this reason, <span class="glossary-term">environmental stewardship</span> in tourism is of paramount importance.</p> <p>Environmental stewardship can be defined as “the responsible use (including conservation) of natural resources in a way that takes full and balanced account of the interests of society, future generations, and other species, as well as of private needs, and accepts significant answerability to society” (Worrell &amp; Appleby, 2000, p. 263). Further to this, indigenous peoples within BC and Canada see people and communities as integral pieces to the land management and caretaking process. As noted by the Assembly of First Nations (2020):</p> <blockquote><p>Indigenous peoples are caretakers of Mother Earth and realize and respect her gifts of water, air and fire. First Nations peoples’ have a special relationship with the earth and all living things in it. This relationship is based on a profound spiritual connection to Mother Earth that guided indigenous peoples to practice reverence, humility and reciprocity. It is also based on the subsistence needs and values extending back thousands of years. Hunting, gathering, and fishing to secure food includes harvesting food for self, family, the elderly, widows, the community, and for ceremonial purposes. Everything is taken and used with the understanding that we take only what we need, and we must use great care and be aware of how we take and how much of it so that future generations will not be put in peril.</p></blockquote> <p>This chapter explores the concept of environmental stewardship, the impacts of tourism on the natural environment (and vice versa), and ways we can minimize these impacts.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1684" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1684" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1683" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching.jpg" alt="A black bear checks under a rock by a river." width="600" height="394" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-300x197.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-1024x673.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-768x504.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-1536x1009.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-225x148.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Bear-Watching-350x230.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1684">Figure 10.1 A foraging black bear is photographed by a tourist on a wildlife viewing trip.

It is critical to note that Indigenous peoples throughout the world, including the various Indigenous Nations throughout the land now known as British Columbia have always been the original stewards of their Territories and lands.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Stewardship</span> is often defined as having the duty of and then actively participating in the careful management of resources. <span style="margin: 0px; color: black; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">Resource stewardship concepts have roots in a diversity of early practices, often founded on intimate connections between humans, their unique cultural practices and nature (McMillen et. al., 2020). Indigenous knowledge and practices of stewardship concepts were pushed aside for decades as European and white settlers in British Columbia removed Indigenous people from their Lands and implemented Euro-centric systems of land management (Kimmerer, 2013; Wildcat et. al., 2014). </span><span style="margin: 0px; color: black; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif; font-size: 14pt;">Indigenous peoples are often ideally suited to implement stewardship of lands due to in-depth knowledge of their Territories and the stewardship practices developed over centuries of ecosystem management and land connection (Bird &amp; Nimmo, 2018; Kimmerer, 2013).&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The topic&nbsp;of stewardship&nbsp;entered Western thought in the middle of the last century in the works of writers such as Aldo Leopard (<em>A Sand Country Almanac</em>), Garret Hardin (<em>The Tragedy of the Commons</em>), and Rachel Carson (<em>Silent Spring</em>). Building on this growing consciousness, concepts of sustainability and sustainable development was introduced into mainstream policy and thought.</p> <p>One of the first commonly accepted definitions of <span class="glossary-term">sustainable development</span> came from the World Commission on Environment and Development, later renamed the Brundtland Commission. It defined sustainable development as meeting “the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987, p. 41). Sustainable development models include aspects that interconnect components of social, economic and environmental sustainability, and how these components can work together for long-term, intergenerational outcomes.</p> <p>A related&nbsp;concept is <span class="glossary-term">environmental management</span>, where&nbsp;the natural resources of the environment are managed through policies designed to protect natural values while providing a framework for use.&nbsp;In&nbsp;tourism, this management may be the responsibility of many groups including individual operators, tourism industry organizations, non-governmental organizations, or government agencies (Mercer, 2004; Williams &amp; Ponsford, 2008).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1684" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1684" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony.jpg" alt="A large crowd of people sit in an auditorium." width="500" height="335" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-300x201.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-768x514.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-225x151.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/COP15-UNFCCC-Climate-Change-Opening-Ceremony-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10.2 Delegates at the 2009 United Nations Conference on Climate Change in Copenhagen.</div></div> <h1>The Need for Change</h1> <p>Experts around the world agree that&nbsp;the need&nbsp;for stewardship has never been greater, as there exists overwhelming&nbsp;evidence that the&nbsp;environment is being irrevocably damaged&nbsp;by human actions.

Tourism continues to grow globally, and many tourists are in pursuit of pristine, natural environments. Development of tourism products results in increased urbanization, overuse, exceeding carrying capacity, and contamination of natural resources (Williams &amp; Ponsford, 2008).

Global temperature changes may create water shortages, a loss of biodiversity, impacts to landscape aesthetics, and damage to infrastructure through extreme weather events. Examples in tourism include the inability to maintain resort facilities in desert environments due to water shortages, erosion of tropical atolls from rising sea levels, extinction of valuable wildlife species due to changes in habitat, and increased costs of maintaining infrastructure in the face of environmental change.</p> <p>Impacts of mitigation policies on tourist mobility will become apparent as the tourism industry adjusts to environmental changes. Environmental impact mitigation strategies may create challenges for the long-term sustainability of the tourism industry. Tourism products may be offered over a shorter season, prices may increase due to a rise in operating costs, and there may be a shortage of pristine natural areas available for visits.</p> <p>Indirect societal change impacts will slowly become apparent. Economic growth may be stunted in some areas and increase in others, creating societal inequality between nations. Political instability may arise in areas that are facing drastic environmental impact.

That summer the town experienced 54 days of congestion that exceeded its threshold of 20,000 vehicles per day, with vehicle waits and idle times of up to 1.5 hours during peak periods.

There are many examples of <span class="glossary-term">TCC</span> being applied in tourism globally and it is important to note that no two areas have the same set of factors to determine carrying capacity. In Canada, national parks use&nbsp;the concept to ensure visitor numbers are restricted to a sustainable level along with other wilderness areas, protected areas, Indigenous Territories and waterways, campgrounds, and front country experiences.</p> <p>Although <span class="glossary-term">TCC</span> is a theoretical concept that is often discussed and utilized for analysis, in reality it can be challenging to restrict the numbers of tourists arriving at a destination.&nbsp; Both determining and managing the carrying capacity of a destination requires input from local peoples and environmental data.&nbsp; One successful approach is to limit access to an area or to simply limit tourist numbers.</p> <h1>Ecological Footprint</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Ecological footprint</span> is essentially&nbsp;a tool to analyze the impact of a population on Earth&nbsp;(Rees, 2001). The&nbsp;model calculates the total area of land and water resources used&nbsp;to support the population, presenting it in a manner that can be easily related to — usually in terms of the amount of land needed to support an individual at the standard of living that person is used&nbsp;to.</p> <p>Many countries and people of those countries use more natural resources within and beyond their own borders than ecosystems can regenerate (biocapacity). Because of this, these countries and people are essentially running an “ecological deficit.” Nations and people can run these ecological deficits by overusing their own (and other Nations’/peoples’) resources, such as by overfishing, taking resources from other areas, and/or emitting higher levels pf carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than can be absorbed (Global Footprint Network, 2020).</p> <h1>Tragedy of the Commons</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Tragedy of the commons</span> is an economic theory first proposed by Garrett Hardin in 1968, which states&nbsp;that if individuals are given the chance&nbsp;to overuse a common property, they will, in order to realize the maximum personal benefits. If every person does this, common property quickly becomes overused and damaged (Hardin, 1968).</p> <p>For example, a group of tourism operators may look at a pristine natural area and&nbsp;see a chance for economic profit, and in the race for development, little or nothing is done to protect the area.&nbsp;If this unchecked development were to continue, the damage to the environment could&nbsp;reach&nbsp;a point where the elements that attracted tourists in the first place are irreversibly damaged, thus resulting in the “tragedy” that Hardin discusses (Hardin, 1968).</p> <p>The tragedy of the commons leads to something known as the <span class="glossary-term">tourism paradox</span>,&nbsp;a concept that describes the paradoxical nature of tourism’s relationship with the environment.</p> <h1>The Tourism Paradox</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1692" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1692" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range.jpg" alt="Snowy mountains can be seen across the ocean from a rocky shore." width="600" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-300x169.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-768x432.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-65x37.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-225x127.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/British-Columbia-Coast-Range-350x197.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10.6 B.C.’s tourism assets centre heavily on scenery.

This is the paradox: as an industry, tourism both&nbsp;creates damage and suffers from it. That’s why it’s critical for the industry to be&nbsp;proactive about&nbsp;environmental sustainability in tourism; failing to do so may result in our&nbsp;downfall (Williams &amp; Ponsford, 2008).</p> <p>Before we gain a&nbsp;better understanding of the ways the tourism industry and individual operators can try to mitigate their impacts, let’s take a closer look at the overall management of BC’s environmental resources.</p> <h1>Sustainable Tourism</h1> <p>The UNWTO sees sustainable tourism as a set of guidelines and management practices that can be applied to all forms of tourism (from small-scale to mass tourism) and in all destination types (2005).&nbsp; When referring to sustainable tourism, sustainability principles relating to environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development must be addressed.&nbsp; As such, sustainable tourism development requires the informed consent and input from local people and stakeholders and must address the need to:</p> <ol><li>Make optimal use of environmental resources that constitute a key element in tourism development, maintaining essential ecological processes and helping to conserve natural heritage and biodiversity.</li> <li>Respect the socio-cultural authenticity of host communities, conserve their built and living cultural heritage and traditional values, and contribute to inter-cultural understanding and tolerance.</li> <li>Ensure viable, long-term economic operations, providing socio-economic benefits to all stakeholders that are fairly distributed, including stable employment and income-earning opportunities and social services to host communities, and contributing to poverty alleviation (UNWTO, 2005, p. 11–12).</li> </ol> <p>Many industry leaders feel that the sustainable tourism movement is fragmented and lacks leadership and accountability due to the fragmentation of the tourism industry itself (Mullis, 2017). Tourists themselves have a large role to play in this equation in that their experiences are generally more positive when experiences incorporate sustainability principles and it has been found that tourists are more likely to visit or make purchases from tourism companies that have sustainability practices in place (Mandala Research, 2015).</p> <h1>Responsible Tourism</h1> <p>Responsible Tourism is an approach to tourism development that was defined through the Cape Town Declaration in 2002 in an effort to provide practical, evidence-based solutions that sustainable tourism approaches have not succeeded to do.&nbsp; Responsible tourism is defined as “making better places for people to live in and better places for people to visit” (Cape Town Declaration, 2002).&nbsp; Responsible tourism approaches focus on identifying important issues to local people and their environments, addressing those issues and transparently reporting and monitoring on those issues.</p> <p>The Cape Town Declaration recognizes that Tourism can provide numerous benefits to people and destinations however tourist and industry behaviour must be managed in a way that is defined by local people who know what they need best.</p> <p>The Responsible Tourism approach is defined by tourism that:</p> <ul><li>minimizes negative economic, environmental and social impacts;</li> <li>generates greater economic benefits for local people and enhances the well-being of host communities, improves working conditions and access to the industry;</li> <li>involves local people in decisions that affect their lives and life changes;</li> <li>makes positive contributions to the conservation of natural and cultural heritage, to the maintenance of the world’s diversity;</li> <li>provides more enjoyable experiences for tourists through more meaningful connections with local people, and a greater understanding of local cultural, social and environmental issues;</li> <li>provides access for people with disabilities and the disadvantaged;</li> <li>is culturally sensitive, engenders respect between tourists and hosts, and builds local pride and confidence (Harold Goodwin, 2014).</li> </ul> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Each of these agencies at First Nations, provincial and federal government levels have a role to play, from regulation of land access and&nbsp;resource extraction to&nbsp;environmental monitoring and cleanup. To understand how the impacts are managed, let’s review the basic categories of land use in BC.</p> <h1>Land Use</h1> <p>There are essentially four broad land categories in BC: First Nations land, private land, provincial Crown land, and federal Crown land.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">First Nations land</span> <span style="float: none; background-color: transparent; color: #333333; cursor: text; font-family: 'Times New Roman',Georgia,'SBL Greek',serif; font-size: 18.66px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; text-align: left; text-decoration: none; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none;">includes any area where “Aboriginal title” has been established and responsibilities for management lie with the relevant First Nations group. Large areas of designated Crown land in BC are considered by First Nations groups as traditional, and these are&nbsp;currently going through the treaty negotiation process, which will likely result in a larger proportion of the BC land area coming under First Nations management.</span></p> <p>In 1997, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in the Delgamuukw case that Aboriginal title is “a right to the land itself—not just the right to hunt, fish and gather.” This case confirmed that “Aboriginal title still exists in BC and that when dealing with Crown land the government must consult with and may have to compensate First Nations whose rights are affected” (BC Treaty Commission, 2020).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Private land</span> in BC is&nbsp;any land where private property rights apply. This includes residential, commercial, and agricultural zoned land throughout the province. If private property rights apply, the owner has more rights over that land for development and use than any other classification of land. Tourism companies wishing to operate on private property need to gain ownership of the land, or failing that, permission to operate on the land. Private property accounts for approximately 5% of the land mass in BC (Government of BC, 2011).</p> <p>The term <span class="glossary-term">Crown land</span> applies to any land that is owned by either the provincial or federal government.&nbsp;Provincial Crown land&nbsp;makes up 94% of BC, making it the largest category of land in the province. Provincial Crown land is available for a wide range of activities that encourage recreation and economic development, including tourism (Government of BC,&nbsp;2011).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1696" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1696" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1695" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J..jpg" alt="A park ranger holds out a clear plastic cube to a young girl while crouched in tall grass." width="500" height="332" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J..jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-300x199.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-1024x681.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-768x510.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-1536x1021.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/BC-Parks-Ranger-A.J.-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1696">Figure 10.7 A BC Parks ranger conducts an interpretive program.</div></div> <p>Designated park areas are managed by <span class="glossary-term">BC Parks</span>, the agency that reviews and issues permits for tourism companies to operate within a park. Other provincial Crown land is managed by a variety of government agencies, such as the Ministry of Forests, Lands, and Natural Resource Operations (MFLNR).</p> <p>Federal Crown land is all land that is owned by the Government of Canada; in BC, less&nbsp;than 1% of the overall land is federal Crown land. It primarily consists of parks and protected areas that are managed by <span class="glossary-term">Parks Canada</span>, the federal agency that has&nbsp;a&nbsp;mandate to preserve and share&nbsp;“natural and cultural heritage” and help ensure enjoyment and appreciation “for present and future generations” (Parks Canada, n.d.).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look:&nbsp;Parks and Protected Areas in BC</strong></p> <p>Two examples of pristine parks in BC are Pacific Rim National Park and Garibaldi Provincial Park. Pacific Rim is operated by Parks Canada. It covers a beautiful stretch of land along the west coast of Vancouver Island. Visit the webpage at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.parkscanada.gc.ca/pacrim" data-url="http://www.parkscanada.gc.ca/pacrim">Pacific Rim National Park Reserve</a>.</p> <p>Garibaldi is managed by BC Parks. It is located just north of Vancouver and protects a pristine mountainous region. Learn more at the <a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/garibaldi/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/bcparks/explore/parkpgs/garibaldi/">Garibaldi Provincial Park website</a>. Both parks serve as significant natural attractions for tourism in BC.</p> </div> <h2>Land Use for Tourism and Hospitality</h2> <p>Businesses and organizations wishing to use Crown land for economic development must apply and be approved for Crown land tenure, which is an agreement&nbsp;with the BC government&nbsp;to use the&nbsp;land for commercial purposes. Examples of the types of tourism operations that might seek tenure&nbsp;include mountain resorts, golf courses, backcountry lodges, tour operators, resort development, and marina construction. It’s estimated that about&nbsp;16% of the tourism industry in BC depends on access to Crown land through the Crown land tenure program (Government of BC, 2010).</p> <p>Different tenures are available depending on the type, location, and intensity of use proposed. A temporary permit grants use&nbsp;for approved activities for up to two years, but not exclusive use (other commercial operators may still use&nbsp;the area). A licence of occupation, the next level of tenure, provides for light development&nbsp;(e.g., semi-permanent structures or trails). This type of licence is typically issued for terms of five to 30 years and is renewable. A lease is a long-term contract for tenure, typically for&nbsp;30 years. With a lease, operators can make&nbsp;substantial improvements to the land&nbsp;including&nbsp;significant structures such as lodges, restaurants, ski lifts, roads, and so on. It is the longest term and the most secure type of tenure (Government of BC, 2010).</p> <p>Any tourism business&nbsp;wishing to operate on First Nations land requires permission from the local First Nation.&nbsp;Companies wanting to operate in&nbsp;a National Park also need to apply for a permit. Although resource extraction is restricted, national parks often encourage tourism development&nbsp;that is sustainable and appropriate for the local environment.</p> <p>Other elements of environmental stewardship in BC fall to the <span class="glossary-term">Ministry of Environment and Climate Change Strategy</span>. This ministry focuses on environmental protection, environmental sustainability, strategic policy, managing and developing parks and protected areas, climate action, and managing Conservation Officer Servicea.</p> <p>Additionally, the <span class="glossary-term">Environmental Assessment Office</span> plays an important role in environmental stewardship on Crown lands in BC. All major projects being proposed for development on Crown land must undergo an environmental assessment and have it approved by this office, which is a neutral agency set up specifically for this purpose. Projects are evaluated not only for their potential impacts on the environment, but also on their economic, social, cultural, and heritage aspects.&nbsp;Large-scale tourism projects such as mountain resorts are required to proceed through the environmental assessment process (Environmental Assessment Office, n.d.).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1696" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1696" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet.jpg" alt="Aerial view of mountainsides that have large sections of trees missing due to logging." width="400" height="600" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet.jpg 1365w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-200x300.jpg 200w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-65x98.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-225x338.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Logging-decimation-in-Jervis-Inlet-350x525.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10.8 Logging sites visible from the air in Jervis Inlet.</div></div> <p>The current land management system in BC has led to numerous conflicts between tourism operators and resource extraction operations such as mining and forestry. Often, overlapping tenure is given to multiple companies with conflicting operational goals. Tourism operators typically require a clean environment, high-quality viewscapes, intact biodiversity, and an environment free of industrial scars. To maintain these values, any resource extraction needs to occur far from where tourism operators conduct their activities. In recent years, tensions have been building as access to wilderness areas becomes scarcer, with tourism values often falling second to resource extraction under the existing system (Webster, 2013).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Conflicts Between Tourism and Resource Extraction&nbsp;in BC</strong></p> <p>Tourism companies complain that despite being part of the $1.6 billion nature-based tourism industry in BC, the government favours traditional logging values.

The winters of 2013/2014 and 2014/2015 were two of the warmest on record, and numerous low-elevation coastal mountain resorts were forced to close in the middle of the winter season (Hager, 2015). As well, the province is experiencing increased pressure on endangered wildlife species that&nbsp;draw tourists and residents alike.

Consequently, carbon offsetting has proven popular with tourism companies that can offset some or all of their emissions, either by themselves or by providing the opportunity for customers to do so. Examples are most commonly found in the transportation sector, where the reliance on traditional fossil fuels makes it challenging to completely eliminate carbon emissions.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1702" style="width: 450px"><img class="wp-image-1700" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline.jpg" alt="A symbol saying &amp;quot;carbon neutral&amp;quot; on the side of a sea plane." width="450" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Harbour-Air-the-worlds-first-Carbon-Neutral-Airline-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 10.10 A detail from the side of a Harbour Air seaplane.</div></div> <p>Take the small B.C. airline <a href="https://www.harbourair.com/" data-url="https://www.harbourair.com/">Harbour Air</a>, for instance.

Not only is this the right thing to do for the physical environment, it’s also a means to save money.</p> <p>For example, the Four Seasons in Vancouver reduced their electricity consumption by 4,000 megawatt hours in the period between fall 2012 and spring 2014. They did this by installing timers and photocells on lights, auditing appliances, ensuring proper maintenance of the furnace and HVAC systems, and cleaning light fixtures and fans so these operated at their best.

However, water is not evenly distributed across regions, nor is it equally available all seasons of the year (BC Ministry of Environment, n.d.b). This is especially evident on Salt Spring Island, a popular tourist destination with numerous small accommodation properties. The island experiences water shortages in the peak summer season when lake and groundwater levels drop and demand is highest.</p> <p>In 2006, a number&nbsp;of local water conservation groups on Salt Spring Island surveyed 117 accommodation providers to determine what measures might be taken to alleviate the summer pressure on freshwater systems. They were pleasantly surprised to find that several properties had already taken steps, including installing low-flow toilets and flow restrictors on shower heads, requiring minimum two-night stays (which reduces the amount of laundry required), and offering visitor education campaigns. The combined efforts of properties on the island have proven to make a significant difference to the collective capacity of 1,500 guests per night (O’Callaghan, 2006).</p> <h1>Food Production and the Environment</h1> <p>As discussed in <a class="internal" href="#part-food-and-beverage-services" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/food-and-beverage-services/">Chapter 4</a> on food and beverage services, there is increasing awareness among the general public about the importance of healthful eating. This&nbsp;goes hand in hand with an increased understanding of food production issues including environmental impacts such as pollution, soil depletion, and the toxicity (both to humans and the environment) of industrial food growth practices. Over the last 30 years, American (and to an extent, Canadian) food growth has centred on the mass production of inexpensive staple foods such as corn and soy, which are used in&nbsp;unhealthy foods like high-fructose corn syrup and soybean oil, and are fed to the animals we eat (University of Minnesota, 2009).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Island Chefs Collaborative<br /> </strong></p> <p>The <strong>Island Chefs Collaborative (ICC)</strong> is an organization that supports connections between local agriculture and the food and beverage industry.

The impacts of these chemicals to date include the creation of a “dead zone” at the outflow of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico, where no fish or other animals can live (University of Minnesota, 2009).</p> <p>The soil in which food is grown is becoming less rich as commercial fertilizers focus only on building specific nutrients.&nbsp;Combined with the long distances that foods are shipped (sometimes causing nutrients to be depleted), consumers are becoming wary of commercially produced foods (University of Minnesota, 2009).</p> <h2>The 100-Mile Diet and Farm to Table</h2> <p>In 2005, two BC-based journalists, J.B. MacKinnon and Alisa Smith, began chronicling the challenges of only eating food produced within 100 miles of their homes, as part of a serial of articles for the <em>Tyee</em>. Their posts&nbsp;became a book, <em>The 100-Mile Diet</em>, launched in 2007 and&nbsp;heralded as a vanguard of the local food movement (<em>Tyee</em>, 2005).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Circle Farm Tour</strong></p> <p>Created through a partnership between destination marketing organizations in the Fraser Valley communities of Abbotsford, Chilliwack, Agassiz-Harrison, and Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows, the Circle Farm Tour brings awareness to farming practices and farmland conservation while creating a collaborative tourism product.

With landfills and treatment sites filling to capacity (and sometimes beyond), it’s imperative that communities and businesses work together in the practice of proper waste management through implementing&nbsp;recycling programs, reducing garbage, properly treating industrial and hazardous waste, and treating sewage and wastewater (Government of BC, n.d.).</p> <p>One very effective means of reducing garbage taken to the landfill is implementing a food waste program in which food scraps are placed in a green bin and collected by the community for composting. The City of Vancouver initially introduced such a program to single family households from 2011 to 2013 and saw a 30% drop in garbage generated. In 2014, the program was&nbsp;expanded to include all households and businesses and placed a ban on food scraps in the garbage. The program met resistance from the BC Restaurant and Foodservices Association, which viewed the initiative as placing an extra cost and being a logistical challenge for members (Nagel, 2014). Individual restaurateurs were hopeful, however, that the city would help businesses by increasing pickup and expanding the efficiency of their other recycling programs (Robinson, 2014).</p> <h1>Plants &amp; Wildlife</h1> <p>The impact of tourism to plant-life and wildlife in BC is immense, and the impacts range from habituation of animals to humans to the actual destruction of ecosystems and habitats as well as the hastening of species decline. Tourism can affect plant-life through acts of trampling sensitive ecosystems, gathering branches for campfires, over-collecting flowers and plants, litter, and/or careless acts with backcountry use that have sparked uncontrolled forest fires in BC especially this past decade. Wildlife are also affected wherein many animals have become habituated and tolerate tourists wherein feeding and breeding habits are disrupted, habitats are destroyed/access is limited, and food systems are altered greatly.</p> <h1>Accreditation and Certification</h1> <p><span class="glossary-term">Environmental accreditation or certification</span> is a type of voluntary regulation where&nbsp;an organization agrees to follow a set of standards, predefined processes, or regulations. These are generally&nbsp;developed by independent non-governmental organizations with&nbsp;a goal of reducing the environmental impact within an industry. Accreditation can encompass any of the practices discussed so far&nbsp;— from carbon offsetting to energy and water&nbsp;conservation&nbsp;to waste management.</p> <p>Beyond the value of making the ethical decision of working to reduce environmental impacts, organizations receive value by being able to promote themselves as being environmentally friendly&nbsp;and therefore attracting consumers (Font, 2002). And for guests, choosing an independently accredited business&nbsp;may help them avoid companies that are guilty of <span class="glossary-term">greenwashing</span>, which is the promotion of&nbsp;environmentally friendly tourism products without actually achieving the environmental standard promised (Lelenicz &amp; Simoni, 2012; Self, Self, &amp; Bell-Haynes, 2010).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Green Key Global</strong></p> <p>Green Key Global is an international certification body that evaluates the accommodations and meetings industries on the basis of their sustainable initiatives. Headquartered in Ontario, its Green Key Eco-Rating Program awards from 1 to 5 keys to hotels, with 47 properties currently holding the highest rating. Green Key Global conducts an on-site assessment and provides operators with suggestions for improving their sustainability efforts. Awarded keys are then used as marketing and promotional tools. A similar program serves the meetings and events sector.

This&nbsp;typically&nbsp;involves going through an audit to prove adherence to a set of environmental standards (Font, 2002). Generally, an audit consists of an independent third party visiting a business or operation and reviewing its practices against a checklist of standards; those that pass earn the certification or accreditation.</p> <p>It is estimated that over 100 different tourism environmental certification programs exist, each with different standards and criteria (Self, Self, &amp; Bell-Haynes, 2010).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Sustainable Tourism</strong></p> <p>Sustainable Tourism is an environmental tourism certification program where tourism operators are assessed for adherence to sustainability principles.

Proponents claimed that it will add a world-class skiing resort product to the economy. Opponents argue that the environmental impacts are not worth the limited economic return it offers, including threatening grizzly bears and other sensitive species (Lavoie, 2014). The Ktunaxa Nation did not consent to the development and fought the proposal in court. Ultimately, the Nation was victorious in court, and the <a href="https://ourtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/Jumbo-Qatmuk-IPCA-MR-January-20-2020-final.pdf" data-url="https://ourtrust.org/wp-content/uploads/downloads/Jumbo-Qatmuk-IPCA-MR-January-20-2020-final.pdf">final statement from the Ktunaxa Nation, including outcome of the 2020 decision [PDF]</a>, may be found online.</p> <p>The planning process for the resort had taken over 20 years with initial permits issued in 2004. Since then the project faced several delays in order to clear conditions of its environmental assessment, one of which was to receive consent from the Ktunaxa Nation. In December 2014, the project was delayed again as the government asked for more time to evaluate whether the newly poured foundations for lodge buildings were located in avalanche zones (Shaw, 2014). Ultimately, the proposed ski resort area became part of a new Indigenous Protected and Conserved Area spanning approximately 70,000 hectares.</p> <p>Conduct your own research about Qat’muk and the originally proposed Jumbo Mountain Resort using a minimum of three sources, and answer the questions below.</p> <ol><li>What are some of the negative socio-cultural and environmental impacts listed by those opposed to the resort?</li> <li>How might those impacts have been mitigated?

This could be experienced as a financial loss, damage to property, or injury to workers or guests. Understandably, tourism operators are interested in preventing these events from occuring, which is why practicing risk management is an essential business skill.<a class="internal" id="retfig11.1" href="" data-url=""></a></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1712" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1712" style="width: 300px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1710" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Turbulent-Flows.jpg" alt="Sign beside a stream.

Vastly different risks exist across the breadth of tourism and hospitality businesses; there are significant differences in the operation of a hotel as compared to delivering an adventure tourism activity. &nbsp;Consequently, it is helpful to think of risk management as being&nbsp;a process of determining&nbsp;the exposure to risk, and then initiating action to either minimize or eliminate the risk specific to your operation (Enterprise Risk Management, 2004). &nbsp;Mastering a generic model of risk management allows you to apply that model to all operations.</p> <h1>Why Practise Risk Management?</h1> <p>There are generally two core objectives in the practice of <span class="glossary-term">risk management</span> by tourism operators: to avoid injury to guests and employees, and to protect their business operations from financial or physical ruin. &nbsp;Keeping guests and employees safe is a moral, ethical and legal responsibility; this is not to be taken lightly. Protecting business operations includes protecting against damage to property, damage to reputation, and any financial impacts occurring from litigation (Centre for Curriculum, Transfer, and Technology [CCTT], 2003a). By practising this twofold approach, operators demonstrate that they are prioritizing the health and safety of individuals, while still taking steps to protect the operational sustainability of their company.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1712" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1711" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Larry-OBrien-Verdict-Press-Corps.jpg" alt="Several people operate four video cameras on tripods close together.

Destination Canada (2003a) suggests that risk management:</p> <ul><li>Reduces the likelihood of an unwanted and unplanned event</li> <li>Reduces the consequences of the event</li> <li>Enhances your ability to access comprehensive and cost-effective insurance</li> </ul> <p><span class="glossary-term">Risk management</span> can be undertaken at any scale. Individuals, companies, societies, communities, cities, regions, and even governments can follow the process in order to protect themselves from risks, which may range from company-specific risks associated with the operation or significant international risks such as climate change and civil disturbances.</p> <p>Some risk management initiatives are more straightforward to implement than others; they are required by law and enforced by government agencies. For example, companies providing transportation services (such as commercial motor vehicle transport ) have clearly defined requirements as set out by their local motor vehicle branch in government. They are required to use appropriately licensed commercial drivers, submit to regularly scheduled commercial vehicle inspections, and insure their vehicles as required. Failing to adhere to these standards may result in suspension of operating privileges, fines, or even imprisonment. &nbsp;Similar to this is occupational health and safety; this is discussed later in the chapter.</p> <p>However, other aspects of risk management are not regulated. This is characteristic of the majority of tourism and hospitality activities offered in Canada today. Operators offer services to the general public and self-regulate in terms of safety. If injury to a guest occurs, and that guest feels that he or she has grounds for a financial claim, that person can initiate a lawsuit against the tourism operator. If this claim is found valid in court,&nbsp;then the&nbsp;tourism operator may be responsible for a financial settlement to&nbsp;that claimant for damages – physical, financial or otherwise. &nbsp;To prevent, or to respond adequately to scenarios such as this, operations need to be both proactive and diligent in the practice of risk management.</p> <p>In short, tour operators must comply with applicable statutory requirements and be sure to&nbsp;self-monitor to determine if the standard that they are operating at is acceptable to society and their peers.&nbsp;Failing to do so may result in a range of consequences including fines, suspension of operations, or a lawsuit.</p> <h1>Concepts of Risk</h1> <p>Before we proceed deeper into an examination of the risk management process, let’s look at three theoretical concepts of <span class="glossary-term">risk</span>:&nbsp;real risk, perceived risk, and inherent risk.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Real risk</span> is the actual statistical likelihood of an incident occurring. This is typically established through reviews of statistics and other relevant data, and by an analytical process and use of expertise in the field. There is little ambiguity or subjectivity in real risk (DC, 2003a).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Perceived risk</span> is the perception of risk by those undertaking or evaluating the risk itself; it may vary greatly based on their level of apprehension, anxiety, or experience with the specific risk. Perceived risk can also vary greatly from the real risk of an activity; it can be higher or lower than the actual risk. In Adventure Tourism, successful management of perceived risk may include operators promoting the risk of activity as high, even if in reality the risk is minimal (Dowling, 1986).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Inherent risk</span> is the risk that must exist for the activity to occur; examples include the risk of drowning whilst swimming and&nbsp;the risk of falling during skiing.&nbsp;It is impossible to eliminate inherent risk from these activities because it would preclude participating in them.&nbsp;However, operators should take steps to minimize inherent risk; this could include, for example, conducting safety inspections, providing appropriate safety equipment for guests, training staff, and informing participants of the hazards of the activity (CCTC, 2003b).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1712" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1712" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room.jpg" alt="An ambulance parked outside a covered hotel entrance." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Not-a-good-thing-to-move-from-a-hotel-room-to-a-hospital-room-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 11.3 An ambulance outside a Vancouver hotel.</div></div> <h1>Long Descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="fig11.1">Figure 11.1 long description: </strong>A person walking a dog stops to read a sign beside a rushing stream.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-risk-management-process" title="11.2 Risk Management Process"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">59</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">11.2 Risk Management Process</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>There are a variety of risk management models that have been utilized and promoted. Each is generally a variation on the same theme, with each having a slightly different approach to the analysis. You’ll find that large operations, government agencies, military, search and rescue all have their own proprietorial processes. <span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 14pt">Outlined below is the model from Destination Canada for small and medium enterprises. It&nbsp;has four stages: risk identification, risk analysis, risk control, and risk treatment (DC, 2003a).</span></p> <h1>Risk Identification</h1> <p>The initial stage of the risk management process is systematically identifying risks facing the organization. This&nbsp;step is often referred to as risk assessment.&nbsp;An organization can identify risks in the following ways (CTC, 2003a, p. 6):</p> <ul><li>On-site inspections and discussions with management and staff</li> <li>Review of products, services, processes, and contracts</li> <li>Review of historical activities and losses</li> <li>Identification of possible risk scenarios</li> </ul> <p>Once an exhaustive list of the risks is compiled, the next step is to ensure a thorough analysis occurs.</p> <h1>Risk Analysis</h1> <p>A typical risk analysis compares the probability (frequency) of any risks occurring by the consequence (severity) if they do occur. This can be done either in a qualitative or quantitative manner, with either numerical values or descriptors applied. For example, an analysis of the risk of&nbsp;the catastrophic failure of a ski lift at a resort resulting in passengers falling to the ground&nbsp;would likely indicate that the <em>probability</em> of this incident occurring is low due to historical records of use, and required maintenance for safety. However, the <em>consequence</em> would likely be high, considering there could be a large number of passengers involved in a significant fall, resulting in multiple casualties.</p> <p>Operators need to respond (<em>through risk control, see section below</em>) if the analysis determines any of the following: 1) the probability of the risk occurring is unacceptable; 2) the consequence of the risk occurring is unacceptable; or 3) the combined impact of the probability and consequence is deemed unacceptable (Cloutier, 2000).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1715" style="width: 300px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1715" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Carabiner.jpg" alt="A carabiner with a twist lock." width="300" height="225" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Carabiner.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Carabiner-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Carabiner-225x169.jpg 225w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1715">Figure 11.4 Technical safety equipment needs to be regularly inspected as part of the risk management process.</div></div> <h1>Risk Control</h1> <p>Once the risks are identified and analyzed, the next step is implementing mitigation strategies for any unacceptable risks. This step is called risk control, and it comprises&nbsp;two primary concepts: exposure avoidance and loss reduction.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Exposure avoidance</span> involves any mitigation strategies used to avoid the exposure to the risks. Examples are eliminating particularly hazardous activities or services, avoiding certain areas due to environmental threats, or changing a tour destination due to political unrest.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Loss reduction</span>&nbsp;is a different approach; it assumes that you have acknowledged the risk of a particular activity or service, and&nbsp;choose to&nbsp;continue to offer it, but will take steps to mitigate the severity of damage that may occur (CCTT, 2003a). An example is requiring all participants in a ski lesson to wear helmets; the risk of falling still exists, but you have taken action to reduce the severity of any fall.</p> <h1>Risk Treatment</h1> <p>Failing the ability to control all risks identified, the next step in the process is risk treatment. This includes the concept of risk transfer and risk retention. <span class="glossary-term">Risk transfer</span> refers to the transfer of responsibility to another party, either contractually or by insurance. Risk can be transferred through contract either by entering into a contract for service, or by requiring participants to sign a waiver. Risk is transferred through insurance by paying premiums to an insurer, wherein they absorb the financial risk of an incident. <span class="glossary-term">Risk retention</span> refers to the level of risk that is retained by the company through a conscious decision-making process. Examples of this may include the decision to increase the size of insurance deductible to use, the use of self insurance, or consciously not transferring risks due to an inability to do so (CTC, 2003b).</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

These documents are plans designed assist staff in responding to emergency situations. You will find an EAP in virtually every public building in BC. Your classroom most likely has one posted by the exit. The idea behind having such a plan prepared in advance is that it will help staff respond in a consistent, effective manner if an emergency occurs. The scope and nature of the activities dictate what type of plan is required.

Two categories of torts exist: intentional and unintentional.&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">Intentional torts</span> consist of assault, battery, trespass, false imprisonment, nuisance, and defamation.&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">Unintentional torts</span> primarily consist of negligence (Tort Law, n.d.).

Sundance Northwest Resorts Ltd.</em></strong></p> <p>The ruling in <em>Crocker v. Sundance Northwest Resorts Ltd.</em> provides an examination of the elements of a negligent action. The case describes an incident where a ski/snowboard resort hosted a tubing competition and allowed an intoxicated customer to participate. An accident occurred, and the customer was paralyzed as a result. The resort was found to be negligent as it failed to maintain an appropriate standard of care. Damages were awarded to plaintiff (the person suing) but were reduced for “contributory negligence on behalf of the plaintiff,” which means the injured person was also held partly responsible. The ruling can be found here: <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1988/1988canlii45/1988canlii45.html" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1988/1988canlii45/1988canlii45.html"><i>Crocker v. Sundance Northwest Resorts Ltd.</i></a></p> </div> <p>Tourism operators must consider their exposure to unintentional torts, primarily negligence. <span class="glossary-term">Negligence</span> can be defined as “the omission to do something which a reasonable man, guided upon those considerations which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do, or doing something a prudent and reasonable man would not do” (Cloutier, 2000, p. 13). In other words, if the safety standards of a business fall below an established standard and injury occurs as a result, the injured person may sue for negligence.</p> <p>Pursuing legal action against an operation for negligence is a process that needs to be initiated by the party who has been injured (plaintiff). To be successful, four elements have to be proved: injury, duty to care, breach in the standard of care, and causation.</p> <p>The first of these,<span class="glossary-term">&nbsp;injury</span>, means that it must be shown that the person suing did, in fact, receive an injury that resulted&nbsp;in damages. This might be physical damage, such as a bodily injury, or it may be damage to property.</p> <p>The concept of <span class="glossary-term">duty to care</span> refers to the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, a&nbsp;relationship&nbsp;requiring the defending party to care for the&nbsp;plaintiff.&nbsp;For example, in tourism, duty to care relationships exist between hotels and guests, tour guides and tour participants, and instructors and students. Is it expected that the person or organization in the relationship is responsible for ensuring the other person is safe from reasonable harm.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The Steveston Hotel Case</strong></p> <p>The Steveston Hotel Case, made famous in 1999, still serves as a warning to establishments serving liquor. A hotel was held liable for 50% of the damages that occurred when it permitted a patron to drive home intoxicated. The case demonstrated that the hotel had a duty of care to stop serving an already intoxicated person, and to prevent the intoxicated party from driving. You can read more details of the case by visiting&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423094011/https://www.go2hr.ca/training/serving-it-right/responsible-beverage-service/hotel-held-liable-drunk-driving-accident" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20150423094011/https://www.go2hr.ca/training/serving-it-right/responsible-beverage-service/hotel-held-liable-drunk-driving-accident">Hotel Held Liable for Drunk Driving Accident</a>.</p> </div> <p>Once a duty has been established, the next step is proving negligence is to show that there was a <span class="glossary-term">breach in the standard of care</span>. Can it be shown that the defendant failed to work to the recognized standard? The standard may be established by professional organizations or simply by the “reasonable person test,” which is an assessment of what other individuals or operations would have done in the same situation. Tourism operators are responsible for determining what current standards in industry are; not being aware of industry standards is not be an acceptable defence in the courts.</p> <p>The last element that needs to be proved is <span class="glossary-term">causation</span>. This means that there must be a strong link between the actions of the defendant that caused injury to the plaintiff. As an example, if a ski resort failed to clear the ice off its pathways, and a guest fell and was injured on the icy path, it is likely that causation could be proved (Heshka &amp; Jackson, 2011).</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Common types of contracts include contracts for service, employment agreements, rental agreements, and legal releases [waivers] (Cloutier, 2000). Given the importance of all of these types of agreements, it is vital that operators use documents that are valid and based in contract law. For a contract to be valid and legally enforceable, it must contain all of the following components: an offer and acceptance, consideration, an intent to enter into a legal relationship, and sufficient <span class="glossary-term">capacity</span> (understanding) of those involved involved (Longchamps &amp; Wright, 2007). Each of these is described below.</p> <p>Offer and acceptance means that the “offer” (e.g., a rental car agency will advertise a car for rent)&nbsp;must be clear, unequivocal, and include all of the important and relevant terms in the contract. The acceptance also must be clearly expressed (e.g.,&nbsp;the renter agrees to rent the car according to the terms and conditions offered by signing the contract). Once the offer is accepted, it becomes a promise with both parties being bound by the terms of the contract.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Consideration</span> refers to the value that is exchanged between parties in the contract, such as money or services (e.g., the renter pays for use of the rental car). Sometimes consideration is waiving your legal rights for a right to participate in an activity.</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Capacity</span> refers to the ability of individuals to enter the contract. If a person signing a contract does not have sufficient capacity, the contract will not be binding. The most common reason for not having sufficient capacity is age. In most cases, a person who has not reached the legal age of majority cannot contract with someone else. Other requirements for capacity include having sufficient mental capacity, and being the authorized signatory (the person with the authority to sign on behalf of an organization)&nbsp;(Longchamps &amp; Wright, 2007).</p> <p>The implications of contract law to the tourism and hospitality industry are extensive; any contact signed needs to have unambiguous terms, be clearly accepted, have an exchange of value, and be signed by an adult with full mental capacity or by an authorized signatory of the organization. Failing to adhere to any of these conditions will likely result in the contract being considered void.</p> <h1>Waivers</h1> <p>For many tourism operators, <span class="glossary-term">waivers</span> are considered a key part of their risk management process. Waivers are particularly important in the adventure, outdoor, and sport tourism sectors where there is a greater risk of personal injury, and have been proven as an effective risk management tool.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Sample Waiver</strong></p> <p>Waivers are frequently made available by businesses online.

It also requires participants to waive their right to take legal action&nbsp;if an accident occurs. In Canada, these have been repeatedly successful in defending against lawsuits. Despite their effectiveness, there have been cases where waivers have failed to protect an organization, often because the waiver was poorly written or delivered incorrectly (Importance of Waivers in Recreation Programs, n.d.).</p> <p>To be&nbsp;effective, a&nbsp;waiver should include the following four components:</p> <ol><li>It should clearly outline the risks in the activity; this is ‘voluntary acceptance of risk’ in that the signee accepts the risks of the activity.</li> <li>It should waive the participant’s right to pursue legal action against the tourism operation in case of negligence; this is a ‘waiver of claims’ in that the signee agrees not to pursue legal action.</li> <li>It should be relatively short and easy to read, be easily recognized as a legal document, and include a place for signature that can be witnessed by a company employee. Current best practices indicate a waiver should not be signed by a friend of the signee or another guest.</li> <li>It should be signed by participants only when they have been given ample time to read and understand it well in advance of the event or activity. Failure to provide enough time may be interpreted by the courts as signing under duress, which would make the contract void and mean that the waiver could not be used as a defence against negligence</li> </ol> <p>The components above are brief summary of what components should be included in waiver documentation; legal counsel should be sought to draft a waiver for specific operation (Importance of Liability Waivers in Recreation Programs, n.d.; <em>Karroll v.

Insurance transfers the financial risks to a third party — the insurance company. Operators pay premiums that are established by the insurer based on the risk of the coverage. If the likelihood or the uncertainty of claims is high, the premiums will be higher. There are a variety of reasons why a tourism company requires insurance: to control the risk of offered activities, to meet statutory requirements, because industry partners require it, to protect business and assets, and to protect employees (DC, 2003b, p. 3). Insurance does not prevent accidents from happening, nor does it make an operation safer. It does, however, provide a reasonable amount of financial protection if an accident does happen.</p> <p>Common types of insurance policies required by tourism operators include <span class="glossary-term">commercial general liability</span>&nbsp;(CGL), property insurance, and accounts receivable insurance. CGL insurance can be one of the most important coverages, but unfortunately it can also be one of the most difficult and expensive to obtain. CGL policies cover operators for liability if an accident occurs, including bodily injury, medical payments, and personal injury. Property insurance provides coverage for the financial risks associated with loss of assets such as buildings, equipment, and merchandise. Accounts receivable insurance can cover a large proportion of account receivables if a customer fails to pay due to default or insolvency, thus providing a considerable safeguard to any tourism operation (DC, 2003a; DC, 2003b; Destination BC, 2013).</p> <p>Some insurance coverage is optional, and operators may decide to self-insure on assets such as property and accounts receivable. <span class="glossary-term">Self insuring</span> is the practice of an operation retaining the risk rather than transferring through insurance; it may be a conscious choice or a necessity based on lack of available coverage.&nbsp;Other insurance coverage may be required, such as motor vehicle insurance or liability insurance (required by most industry partners and some statutory requirements). In the end, the tourism operator must determine what coverage is required and what optional additional coverage is desired.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The incident took place in 2013.</p> <p>In court documents, Pamela Boileau said she visited the resort with her husband and two young children to use the tube park, where, she claimed,&nbsp;no signs were posted restricting the age of children allowed to use the facility. She then took a ride with her husband and their baby.</p> <p>According to her filing, “the ride was very fast and bumpy and the tubes went high on the berm and then hit a big bump and the plaintiff’s infant daughter went flying out of her tube” (Petriuk, 2015). In order to help her daughter, Boileau stopped the tube she was riding in abruptly and broke her leg in multiple places.</p> <p>According to Boileau, the next day the resort erected signage prohibiting children under four years of age from using the tubing park. She sued for&nbsp;general damages, special damages and interest, and money for past and future health care. The lawsuit&nbsp;named Sun Peaks Resort Corporation and four employees in the claim.</p> <p>Based on this description of the claim, as circulated in the media, answer the following questions to the best of your ability:</p> <ol><li>What evidence is there that staff at the resort had engaged in the four stages of risk identification? For each stage, note&nbsp;what the resort could have done differently.</li> <li>What were the real, perceived, and inherent risks of using the tube park?

In Canada, tourism operations that are majority owned and operated by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit people comprise this segment of the industry (Butler and Hinch, 2007; ITAC, 2020).

Visitors to Australia can meet an Aboriginal guide who will help them feel a spiritual connection through a memorable outback experience. In New Zealand (Aotearoa in the Maori language), tourists are often welcomed into a ceremonial community <span class="glossary-term">marae</span>,&nbsp;a communal or sacred centre that serves a religious and social purpose in Polynesian societies (New Zealand Maori Tourism Society, 2012).</p> <p>In the mountainous region of northern Vietnam, traditionally dressed ethnic minority villagers are now opening their homes to international trekkers, thus generating new income for the community. In the United States, visitors to the ancient desert wonders of Monument Valley can enhance their experience in a Navaho-run hotel, enjoying Indigenous cuisine while learning about the cultures of the Native American groups that have lived there for centuries.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: International guidelines</strong></p> <p>In 2016, global tour operator G Adventures, Planeterra Foundation, and the International Institute of Tourism Studies at the George Washington University collaborated to develop a set of practical, international guidelines, “that can be used by any travel company wishing to offer experiences with Indigenous communities.” Read more about <a href="https://www.gadventures.com/about-us/responsible-travel/indigenous-guidelines/" data-url="https://www.gadventures.com/about-us/responsible-travel/indigenous-guidelines/">responsible travel with Indigenous people on the G Adventures website</a>.</p> <p>Explore these guidelines as part of reflecting on your own travel experiences and choices, and better integrating this into tourism product development and delivery: <a href="https://media.gadventures.com/media-server/dynamic/admin/flatpages/indigenous-2017-11-29.pdf" data-url="https://media.gadventures.com/media-server/dynamic/admin/flatpages/indigenous-2017-11-29.pdf"><em>Indigenous People and the Travel Industry: Global Good Practice Guidelines</em> [PDF]</a>.</p> </div> <p>Those readers familiar with the first edition of this textbook may have realized the chapter title change from “Aboriginal Tourism” to “Indigenous Tourism.” This adjustment mirrors the official change in Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s newly elected Liberal Government — a decision that reverses the change made by the Conservative Government in 2011 which at the time abolished the use of Indigenous to Aboriginal (from the former Liberal Government). The more recent 2015 change was reported as being sanctioned by the Assembly of First Nations (AFN), as well as Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Chair Justice Murray Sinclair (Lum, 2015). The shift in terminology from “Aboriginal Tourism” to “Indigenous Tourism” has also recently occurred in many leading tourism organizations and education institutions within Canada.</p> <p>For the purposes of this revision there are times when the terms “Aboriginal” and “Indigenous” are used interchangeably, particularity when referring to valuable industry resources created prior to the more recent practice. The changes to the terminology used to identify and refer to Indigenous peoples globally, and in Canada is fraught with challenges, and many of these difficulties are embedded in the oppressive structures or systems associated with colonialism, past and present.</p> <p>Within the international context, it is worth noting that “Aboriginal” is still commonly used to refer to the Indigenous people of mainland Australia — though its use there is also critiqued for the way it simplifies Australian Indigenous history (Common Ground, 2020). Similar to Indian and Eskimo, the tangled use of Aboriginal is embedded in the power relationships with colonial governments and history. These perspectives point to the geographic and culturally based discrepancies, which affirm the exceptional diversity within and between Indigenous groups.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Understanding the use of “Indigenous” in Canada<br /> </strong></p> <p>For additional background and a national media perspective on the use of “Indigenous” in Canada, view this short video: <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/709875267537/" data-url="https://www.cbc.ca/player/play/709875267537/">From “redskin” to Indigenous: Unreserved takes a look at what Indigenous Peoples have been called and what they call themselves</a> (CBC, 2016).</p> </div> <p>According to the United Nations (UN), there are 370 million Indigenous people globally, representing 5 per cent of the world’s population, and living across 90 countries<em>.</em>The UN defines <span class="glossary-term">Indigenous peoples</span> as “inheritors and practitioners of unique cultures and ways of relating to people and the environment”, who have “retained social, cultural, economic and political characteristics that are distinct from those of the dominant societies in which they live” (npn). Notwithstanding the uniqueness of Indigenous peoples around the globe, they are considered to be among the most disadvantaged and vulnerable groups in the world, and therefore share common challenges related to the protection of their rights as distinct peoples (UN, 2020). The nature of oppression experienced by Indigenous peoples around the globe has been documented, notably by the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues and their commissioned research and awareness-building campaign, the State of the World’s Indigenous people (SOWIP) (SOWIP, 2010, 2019).</p> <p>In 2016 there were 1,673,785 Indigenous people in Canada, this number accounts for 4.9% of the total population, which is up from 3.8% in 2006, and 2.8% in 1996 (Statistics Canada, 2016). Indigenous peoples have lived across present-day Canada for thousands of years and have numerous languages, cultures, and spiritual beliefs. In 2020, there are more than 630 First Nation communities in Canada, which represent more than 50 Nations and 50 Indigenous languages (Statistics Canada, 2016).</p> <h1>What’s in a Name?</h1> <p>There are three groups of Indigenous peoples recognized in the Canadian Constitution Act: Inuit, Métis, and First Nations. <span class="glossary-term">Indian (or Native Indian)</span> is still an important legal term in Canada given the on-going, if highly contested and emotionally charged, relevance of the 1876 Indian Act (Gray, 2011).</p> <p><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',serif">Recognized as an assimilation tool used by the Dominion of Canada under the British North America Act, the Indian Act gave the federal government jurisdiction over Indigenous lands and was entwined with significant negative impacts on Indigenous cultural and spiritual expression tied to that land that persist to present day (Joseph, 2018).</span></p> <p>The Indian Act also held important identity granting consequences, both legally and culturally. As a result many Indigenous people associate “Indian” with government regulation and colonialism, and its use has gone out of favour; this practice is unlike usage in the United States where <span class="glossary-term">North American Indian</span> (or Native American) is still common (Wilson &amp; Henderson, 2014).</p> <p><span class="glossary-term">Inuit</span> have lived in the Arctic region of Canada for countless years. Many Inuit continue to rely on the resources of the land, ice, and sea to maintain traditional connections to the land. The old ways of life were seriously compromised, however, when Inuit began to participate with European settlers in the fur trade. The Government of Canada accelerated this change by requiring many Inuit communities to move away from their traditional hunting and gathering ways of life on the land and into permanent, centralized settlements (Wilson &amp; Henderson, 2014). Today, in spite of social and economic hardships created by this change, many Inuit communities focus on protecting their traditional way of life and language.</p> <p>Not so long ago, it was common for non-Inuit people in Canada to use the term <span class="glossary-term">Eskimo</span> (“eaters of raw meat”) to refer to Inuit people; however, the use of “Eskimo” within the Canadian context is now widely considered insulting and should be avoided (Wilson &amp; Henderson, 2014). That said, this is not the case in Alaska, where the use of “Eskimo” is still common practice (University of Alaska at Fairbanks [UAF], 2020).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami </strong></p> <p>Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) is the national Inuit organization in Canada. It represents four regions: Nunatsiavut (Labrador), Nunavik (northern Quebec), Nunavut, and the Inuvialuit Settlement Region in the Northwest Territories. It is an advocacy organization that represents the interests of Inuit in environmental, social, political, and economic affairs, including economic and tourism development.

In the 1600s and 1700s, many French and Scottish men migrated to Canada for the fur trade. Some of them had children with First Nations women and formed new communities, and their descendants became the first to be called Métis. The distinct Métis culture is known for its fine bead-work, fiddling, and jigging. Canadian and international tourists can learn from and enjoy participating in a large number of Métis festivals in most provinces across the country. Today, the infinity symbol on the Métis flag symbolizes the joining of two cultures that will live forever.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: Louis Riel Institute</strong></p> <p>The Louis Riel Institute in Winnipeg is dedicated to the preservation and celebration of Métis culture and supporting Métis in achieving their educational, career, and life goals.

However, many First Nations communities are working hard to reclaim their traditions, and in many places there is an increasing pride in the resurgence of Indigenous culture.</p> <p>The entanglement of self-identification preferences used by Indigenous people to name themselves points to an increasingly politically fuelled and culturally empowered Indigenous identity landscape. There is a parallel tension and range of terminology used when referring to people who are not Indigenous to a place. In Canada, these terms include “non-Indigenous” and “Settlers” (Battell Lowman &amp; Barker, 2015). Language and terminology are particularly interesting and important to be aware of and reflect on in the context of tourism studies and activities. There is significant diversity in terms are used across Canada, including within regions and communities.</p> <p>There is an increasing appreciation that intercultural exchanges can help strengthen cultures at risk and biological diversity, if managed thoughtfully. For example, the growing niche of Arctic cruise tourism has brought both opportunities and challenges to the isolated small communities of Canada’s rugged Arctic coast. In recognition, the World Wildlife Fund produced a Code of Conduct for Tour Operators in the Arctic, and for Arctic Tourists. In part, it reads:</p> <blockquote><p>Respect Local Cultures:</p> <ul><li>Learn about the culture and customs of the areas you will visit before you go.</li> <li>Respect the rights of Arctic residents. You are most likely to be accepted and welcomed if you travel with an open mind, learn about local culture and traditions, and respect local&nbsp;customs and etiquette.</li> <li>If you are not travelling with a tour, let the community you will visit know that you are&nbsp;coming.</li> <li>Supplies are sometimes scarce in the Arctic, so be prepared to bring your own.</li> <li>Ask permission before you photograph people or enter their property or living spaces.</li> </ul> <p>(WWF International Arctic Programme, n.d., p. 2)</p></blockquote> <p>Wilson &amp; Henderson’s (2014) <a href="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/First-Peoples-A-Guide-for-Newcomers.pdf" data-url="https://vancouver.ca/files/cov/First-Peoples-A-Guide-for-Newcomers.pdf"><em>First Peoples: A Guide for Newcomers</em> [PDF]</a> serves as an excellent introductory resource for tourism professionals who want to know more about the complex socio-political issues surrounding Indigenous peoples in Canadian history and present in society today.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Foundations Guide</strong></p> <p>This <em>Pulling Together: Foundations Guide</em>&nbsp;is also an excellent resource for understanding more of the background and context about Indigenous people within Canada, and changes underway.

Among the many assimilation tools used against Indigenous people, the government forced a system of governance on First Nations so that they could no longer use their system of government.&nbsp;The resultant harms from the explicit and systemic strategies of cultural assimilation afflicted upon Indigenous peoples within Canada continue to be documented (Joseph, 2018) and are increasingly recognized in wider society (see Regan, 2011).</p> <p>The current state of self-determination of Canada’s Indigenous peoples illuminates a growing momentum of cultural resurgences across the Canadian political landscape. In 2020, there are 25 self-government agreements across Canada involving 43 Indigenous communities, and approximately 50 self-government negotiation tables across the country (CIRNAC, 2020a).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Map of Modern Treaties and Self-Government</strong></p> <p>Review the current <a href="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-CIRNAC-RCAANC/DAM-TAG/STAGING/texte-text/mprm_pdf_modrn-treaty_1383144351646_eng.pdf" data-url="https://www.rcaanc-cirnac.gc.ca/DAM/DAM-CIRNAC-RCAANC/DAM-TAG/STAGING/texte-text/mprm_pdf_modrn-treaty_1383144351646_eng.pdf">Modern Treaties and Self-Government Agreements map [PDF]</a>, or to find out what Indigenous Traditional Territory you live, work or play on, go to the <a href="https://native-land.ca/" data-url="https://native-land.ca/">Native Land interactive map</a>.</p> </div> <p>There are increasing examples of Indigenous self-governance, achieved in parallel or complementary processes that involved settling land claims. Self-government refers to the ability of Indigenous people to govern themselves within the framework of the Canadian Constitution (Government of British Columbia, 2020). According to the federal body mandated to modernize Government of Canada structures, Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada (CIRNAC) self-government is:</p> <blockquote><p>Negotiated agreements put decision-making power into the hands of Indigenous governments who make their own choices about how to deliver programs and services to their communities. This can include making decisions about how to better protect their culture and language, educate their students, manage their own lands and develop new business partnerships that create jobs and other benefits for their citizens. (CIRNAC, 2020)</p></blockquote> <p>Different forms of governance and agreements have been negotiated in Canada. Looking to the Canadian north provides noteworthy examples of early ground-breaking modern day treaties.</p> <p>In 1993 Nunavut negotiated a comprehensive land claim agreement, a modern treaty, with the Canadian Government. The agreement is unique because in this case it represents all the people residing in the territory (CIRNAC, 2020). In the western territory of Yukon, 11 of the 14 First Nations have negotiated a self-government and land claims agreement with the federal government. The journey began in 1973, when a delegation of Yukon First Nations Chiefs presented <a href="https://yukon.ca/en/together-today-our-children-tomorrow" data-url="https://yukon.ca/en/together-today-our-children-tomorrow"><em>Together today for our Children Tomorrow: A Statement of Grievances and an Approach to Settlement by the Yukon Indian People</em> (1973)</a> to then Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Twenty years later, in 1993, the historic Umbrella Final Agreement (UFA) was signed, and provided the template to negotiate individual land claim agreements with each Yukon First Nation.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Yukon First Nations Self-Government</strong></p> <p>Learn more about the journey taken by Yukon First Nations and about key milestones in their <a href="https://mappingtheway.ca/" data-url="https://mappingtheway.ca/">Mapping the Way website</a>, which also features several informative videos.</p> </div> <p>Notwithstanding the weight of Canada’s colonial past and its violently negative impacts on Indigenous people, there is some evidence that Canada’s historical trajectory can be challenged and a better future can be imagined. The United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People (UNDRP, 2007) was officially adopted by the Canada in May 2016, and the provincial government of British Columbia followed suit in November 2019 (Government of British Columbia, 2019).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples</strong></p> <p>In 2007, the United Nations passed a declaration to address human rights violations against Indigenous peoples. The document, sometimes known as UNDRIP, contains 46 articles, one of which is “Every indigenous individual has the right to a nationality” (United Nations, 2007, p. 5).

The TRC was created to provide an opportunity for those directly or indirectly affected by the legacy of the Indian Residential Schools system to share their stories. The Indian Residential Schools system was set up as a way to manage objectives outlined in the Indian Act (Gray, 2011; Joseph, 2018; Regan, 2011). The commission’s work resulted in 94 actions, known as the ‘Calls to Action’, which aim to ‘redress the legacy of residential schools and advance the process of Canadian reconciliation’ (NCTR, 2015).

That being said, Indigenous people are working hard to reclaim their traditions, and for many there is an increasing pride in a revitalized culture. Reconciliation, land claims, and increased self-determination support these transformations. Tourism presents an opportunity that, under the right circumstances, can facilitate Indigenous empowerment movements.</p> <p>The history of tourism has seen considerable exploitation of Indigenous peoples. Land has been expropriated, economic activity suppressed by outside interests, and cultural expressions (such as arts and crafts) have been appropriated by outside groups. <span class="glossary-term">Appropriation</span> refers to the act of taking something for one’s own use, typically without the owner’s permission. Specific to overlapping challenges of reconciling appropriation related to land title, and how we proceed in tourism in the BC and Canadian context, it is essential to be aware that:</p> <blockquote><p>Ninety-five percent of British Columbia, including Vancouver, is on unceded traditional First Nations territory.&nbsp;Unceded means that First Nations people never ceded or legally signed away their lands to the Crown or to Canada (Wilson, 2018).</p></blockquote> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1736" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1736" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1736" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb.jpg" alt="Dozens of people hike over a reddish rock formation." width="600" height="429" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-300x215.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-1024x733.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-768x550.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-1536x1100.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-65x47.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-225x161.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/We-Dont-Climb-350x251.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1736">Figure 12.3 This “We Don’t Climb” sign expresses the traditional laws of Australian Aboriginal people and asks that tourists not climb Uluru (once known as Ayers Rock).

Key principles were adopted as resolutions at the gathering and form the Larrakia Declaration, which aims to guide all culturally respectful Indigenous tourism business development (World Indigenous Tourism Alliance, 2012, pp. 1–2):</p> <ul><li>Respect for customary law and lore, land and water, traditional knowledge, traditional cultural expressions, cultural heritage that will underpin all tourism decisions.</li> <li>Indigenous culture, the land and waters on which it is based, will be protected and promoted through well managed tourism practices and appropriate interpretation.</li> <li>Indigenous peoples will determine the extent, nature and organisational arrangements for their participation in tourism and that governments and multilateral agencies will support the empowerment of Indigenous people.</li> <li>Governments have a duty to consult and accommodate Indigenous peoples before undertaking decisions on public policy and programs designed to foster the development of Indigenous tourism.</li> <li>The tourism industry will respect Indigenous intellectual property rights, cultures and traditional practices, the need for sustainable and equitable business partnerships and the proper care of the environment and communities that support them.</li> <li>Equitable partnerships between the tourism industry and Indigenous people will include the sharing of cultural awareness and skills development which support the well-being of communities and enable enhancement of individual livelihoods.</li> </ul> <p>Using these guiding principles, it becomes clear that Indigenous tourism development can be considered successful only if the rights of Indigenous people are upheld.</p> <p>Notwithstanding the possibilities that may occur when following the guidelines described above, tourism at the intersection of reconciliation is a new and complex undertaking. Higgins-Desbiolles (2012) explored tourism as a force for peace, and by extension, its ability to achieve reconciliation mandates. Among other things, she noted that tourism’s economic motivations challenge the social attributes related to meeting reconciliation mandates. Grimwood et al.’s (2019) explorations question tourism’s ability to contribute to reconciliation aspirations given the underlying entanglement tourism has with colonization. Any approach that considers tourism as force that can benefit Indigenous peoples must by necessity ask — sometimes uncomfortable — questions and “learn to tell new stories.”</p> <p>This ability to understand one’s own position and contribution in relation to tourism as force for reconciliation, through decolonization, is as true for tourism researchers and educators, as it is for non-Indigenous tour operators and other sector workers. Decolonization can refer to making space for Indigenous perspectives (Grimwood et al., 2019). In an Indigenous tourism context, it also refers to ensuring we all play a part in supporting the production of tourism experiences that are controlled by, and that directly benefit, the Indigenous peoples whose lands and cultures are featured for the enjoyment of visitors.</p> <p>The history of tourism at the intersection of Indigenous peoples is embedded in colonial power (Higgins-Desbiolles, 2012; Grimwood et al., 2019). Nonetheless, the allure and promise that tourism holds for positively moving forward is compelling. Moreover, there is an increasing appreciation for the way intercultural exchanges can help strengthen cultures at risk, if managed thoughtfully. Despite the risks due to cultural appropriation, there is also growing evidence — that under certain conditions, foremost Indigenous control and ownership – that tourism can promote community and economic development while helping to preserve and strengthen Indigenous culture (OECD, 2019). With that in mind, let’s have a look at some of the features supporting Indigenous tourism in Canada.</p> <h3>Video Attributions</h3> <ul><li>“<a href="https://youtu.be/wjx2zDvyzsU" data-url="https://youtu.be/wjx2zDvyzsU">TRC Mini Documentary – Senator Murray Sinclair on Reconciliation</a>” by National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.

However, over the last 25 years or so, steps have been taken to support authentic Indigenous cultural products and experiences and to counter decades of appropriation of Indigenous symbols and arts and crafts by non-Indigenous Canadians and others elsewhere in the world.</p> <p>Indigenous exhibits and displays were developed for tourism attractions and museums by well-meaning non-Indigenous people who did not consult with local communities. Souvenir shops were often filled with inexpensive overseas-made replicas of authentic Indigenous arts and crafts, and some still are. To this day, we see the Canadian Prairie Indigenous headdress being used as a way of (mis)representing First Nations across Canada. As an example of how things have changed, in August 2020 the <em>Yukon First Nations Arts Brand</em> was created to promote and celebrate ‘all forms of art made by Indigenous artists living in Yukon Territory’. Developed and controlled by the Yukon First Nations Culture and Tourism Association (YFNCT), the brand program will showcase arts and crafts made by Yukon First Nations people.

The outcome was the formation of national organizations that provided a coordinated industry voice for operators: Aboriginal Tourism Team Canada (ATTC), Aboriginal Tourism Canada, and Aboriginal Tourism Marketing Circle (ATMC), and others. These groups started the trend of defining Indigenous cultural tourism standards and promoting the establishment of regional, provincial, and territorial organizations to develop and market more successful businesses.

If developed in a thoughtful and sensitive manner, it can have potential positive economic, cultural, and social impacts. Many communities have undertaken tourism development activities to support cultural revival, intercultural awareness, and economic growth. This growth brings jobs and career opportunities for Indigenous people at all skill levels.</p> <p>The <em>Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Business Planning Guide </em>suggested the following as the foundational building blocks necessary to run a successful and authentic Indigenous tourism business:</p> <ul><li>Understand the industry, learn about cultural tourists, and develop products carefully</li> <li>Ensure experiences are culturally authentic</li> <li>Involve the community’s ‘culture keepers’ and Elders</li> <li>Practice environmental sustainability</li> <li>Prepare an Indigenous cultural tourism business plan</li> <li>Meet visitor expectations through staff training and excellent hospitality, provided from a cultural perspective</li> <li>Ensure an effective web and social media presence</li> <li>Build personal support networks</li> </ul> <p>The guide also highlights the importance of place to the Indigenous tourism experience. It suggests that guests leave an authentic tourism experience with a memorable collection of feelings, memories, and images that all contribute to a unique sense of place and help guests understand the culture being shared (Kanahele, 1991). In order to highlight this sense of place, operators are encouraged to reflect on and impart aspects of their culture with the following elements of their business (Indigenous Tourism BC &amp; CTHRC, 2013):</p> <ul><li>Decor such as signage, displays, art, photography</li> <li>Company name</li> <li>Branding elements such as logo and website design</li> <li>Employee uniforms or dress code</li> <li>Food and beverage</li> <li>Traditional stories shared with guests</li> <li>Key words and expressions from the Indigenous host language shared in guest interactions</li> </ul> <p>These touch points create a richer, and more authentic, experience for the visitor.</p> <p>As an Elder once stated, Indigenous tourism businesses showcase “culture, heritage and traditions,” and “because these belong to the entire community, the community should have some input” (Aboriginal Tourism BC &amp; CTHRC, 2013, p. 19). For this reason, the guide suggests operators consider the extent to which:</p> <ul><li>Community members&nbsp;understand the project or business as it is being proposed</li> <li>Keepers of the culture are engaged in the development of the idea</li> <li>The business or experience reflects community values</li> </ul> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Indigenous Cultural Tourism Checklist (Canada) and Maori Tourism Checklist (New Zealand)</strong></p> <p>Review the <em>Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Business Planning Guide</em> at&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518211757/http://linkbc.ca/siteFiles/85/files/ACTBPG.pdf" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20160518211757/http://linkbc.ca/siteFiles/85/files/ACTBPG.pdf">Aboriginal Cultural Tourism Business Planning Guide [PDF]</a>.</p> <p>The Maori tourism organization in New Zealand has developed a similar guide for Indigenous tourism development.

Indigenous peoples’ connection to the land is well documented and is widely understood as central to Indigenous cultural identity and future prosperity (Brown &amp; Brown, 2009). As explained earlier in this text, the tourism industry is dependent upon the natural and cultural environment, yet tourism can be a direct threat to the health and quality of these essential tourism destination components. Indigenous tourism development is even more sensitive to risks associated with mismanagement given the relational interdependence of Indigenous culture and identity to the places and types of experiences that are increasingly sought after by visitors.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: National Indigenous Guardians Network in Canada</strong></p> <p>The Indigenous Leadership Initiative is a key supporter of a federally funded, Indigenous-led National Indigenous Guardians Network in Canada that supports development and employment of guardians across the country.

The research results identified that specific target markets were particularly motivated to visit BC to experience local or regional Indigenous culture. Leveraging this information and initial organizational momentum, ITBC has matured to become a stable and effective organization by establishing funding partnerships with governments, developing a stakeholder membership model, and initiating a range of development strategies and tactics outlined in regularly updated action plans.</p> <p>ITBC provides recognized leadership to support the estimated 401 Indigenous tourism related businesses operating in BC.

Its goals by 2022 included:</p> <ul><li>Increased provincial revenue of $75 million</li> <li>Employment at 4,950 full-time equivalent positions</li> <li>128 market-ready Indigenous cultural tourism businesses</li> </ul> <p>To achieve these targets, the plan focused on five distinct strategic performance areas:</p> <ul><li>Marketing</li> <li>Experience Development</li> <li>Partnerships</li> <li>Leadership</li> <li>Organizational Excellence</li> </ul> <p>Following good overall tourism planning principles, ITBC ensured its plan aligned with Destination BC’s strategy, <em>Welcoming Visitors—Benefiting Locals—Working Together, A Strategic Framework for Tourism in BC</em>, as well as Canada’s federal tourism strategy. Consistent with this sustained alignment, recent efforts have placed renewed emphasis on the need for market readiness.</p> <h1>Push for Market Readiness</h1> <p>As we’ve learned elsewhere in this textbook, today’s travellers are more complex than in the past and have higher expectations. Potential guests are well acquainted with technology and have the world at their fingertips. For this reason, it’s important that Indigenous operators ensure they are sufficiently ready to run as a tourism business and compete in an increasingly crowded tourism marketplace.</p> <p>There are three categories of readiness, each with a&nbsp;set of criteria that must be met (Aboriginal Tourism Association of Canada, 2013):</p> <ul><li>A <span class="glossary-term">visitor-ready operation</span> is often a start-up or small operation that might qualify for a listing in a tourism directory but not be considered ready for cost-shared promotions with other businesses due to lack of amenities or predictability.</li> <li>A <span class="glossary-term">market-ready business</span> must meet visitor-ready criteria plus demonstrate a number of other strengths around customer service, marketing materials, published pricing and payments policies, short response times and reservations systems, and so on.</li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Export-ready criteria</span> include the previous categories, plus sophisticated travel distribution trade channels to attract out-of-town visitors. They provide highly reliable services to all guests, particularly those traveling with groups.</li> </ul> <p>By educating cultural tourism businesses about these standards, and then creating incentives for marketing opportunities, ITBC helps to raise the bar for BC Indigenous cultural tourism experiences. Its goal is to support as many operators toward market readiness (the second category) as possible so that they may eventually become export ready alongside other BC tourism experiences.</p> <p>Drag the following descriptors to the appropriate category for market readiness:</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The one-day tourism workshop is offered through ITBC and delivered throughout British Columbia</p> <p>FirstHost was inspired by Hawaiian tourism pioneer, Dr. George Kanahele (1913-2000), who saw the impact tourism was having on indigenous culture and set out to educate the industry that “the relationship between place, host and guest must be one of equality” (Native Education College, 2014, p. 28). Participants learn about hospitality service delivery and the special importance of the host, guest, and place relationship.

Each year, the first harvests of roots, berries, fish, and game were celebrated during ceremonies honouring the food chiefs who provided for the people. During the winter, people returned to permanent winter villages. The names of many of the settlements in the Okanagan Valley — Osoyoos, Keremeos, Penticton and Kelowna — come from Indigenous words for these settled areas and attest to the long history of the Syilx people on this land.</p> <p>Forty-five years ago, the OIB was bankrupt and living off government social assistance. In 1988, it sought to turn the tide on this history and created the Osoyoos Indian Band Development Corporation (OIBDC). Through focused leadership and initiative, the band has been able to develop agriculture, eco-tourism, and commercial, industrial, and residential developments on its 32,200 acre reserve lands. It does have the good fortune to be located in one of Canada’s premier agricultural and tourism regions; however, it has also taken a determined and well-crafted effort to become an example of Indigenous economic success.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1746" style="width: 400px"><img class="wp-image-1746" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos.jpg" alt="A smiling front desk employee." width="400" height="600" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos.jpg 1365w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-200x300.jpg 200w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-683x1024.jpg 683w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-1024x1536.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-65x98.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-225x338.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Osoyoos-350x525.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 12.9 Friendly staff at Nk’Mip Desert Cultural Centre.</div></div> <p>The OIBDC manages a number of tourism-related businesses including the Nk’Mip Campground and RV Park, Nk’Mip Canyon Desert Golf Course, Nk’Mip Desert Cultural Centre. In addition, the OIBDC have several prominent tourism-related partnerships, including with Baldy Mt. Ski Resort, Nk’Mip Cellars, Spirit Ridge Resort, and others (OIB, 2020).

Across Canada, Indigenous peoples and their partners are using Indigenous-developed standards to help preserve and strengthen cultures while building economic benefits for their communities. This is directly in line with the global trend toward linking tourism with the need to uphold Indigenous rights.</p> <p>An aim of this chapter was to inspire respectful curiosity among students of tourism and offer a glimpse at the complexity and connectedness of Indigenous tourism in the historic and contemporary spheres of the public and private lives of non-Indigenous and Indigenous peoples in Canada, with a primary focus on British Columbia. Frankly, one chapter can never fully reveal the diversity, resiliency, and cultural richness of Indigenous peoples, nor can it fully reveal the depth of harm wrought by past, and ever-present colonial systemic forces that remain entangled with the phenomenon of tourism.</p> <p>The promise of Indigenous tourism can provide a basis for conversation — and action — among stakeholders with potentially competing aims and differing worldviews. It is important to recognize that these conversations can be emotionally charged, complex and personally unsettling. Nevertheless, the progress that has been made thus far by individuals, communities, businesses, agencies, organizations and governments in developing quality Indigenous tourism opportunities for visitors to British Columbia, Canada and around the world is encouraging. The cumulative results of these efforts demonstrate that properly supported, and most importantly Indigenous-led, Indigenous tourism development can be a powerful force for positive change. Indigenous tourism not only has the potential to contribute to a healthier, more respectful and more prosperous shared future for all, it is arguably one of the best positioned and most appropriate global force to do so.</p> <p>In recent years, the momentum, growth, and evident growth-potential of Indigenous tourism within the tourism sector has had some of the most significant and genuine change and influence on policy, product, destination development within tourism in BC, Canada, and internationally. These changes — catalyzed through Indigenous tourism — are integral for augmenting and repositioning the role of tourism in general within larger provincial, national and international objectives and efforts for reconciliation and sustainable development. Whether a person or business is Indigenous or otherwise, becoming genuinely engaged in moving Indigenous tourism forward is at the front edge of helping tourism reach it’s positive societal and economic potential both domestically and internationally.</p> <p>Up to this point, we’ve gained an understanding of multiple sectors of the industry as well as special considerations for professionals in BC. <a class="internal" href="#part-careers-and-work-experience" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/careers-and-work-experience/">Chapter 13</a> explores careers and work experience in tourism and hospitality.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1749" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1749" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1749" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook.jpg" alt="A brilliant sun rises over mountains and shines on a green golf course by the water." width="600" height="390" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-300x195.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-1024x666.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-768x499.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-1536x998.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-225x146.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/Cranbrook-350x227.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1749">Figure 12.10 Sunrise at St. Eugene Mission Resort owned by the Ktunaxa, the Samson Cree, and the Mnjikaning First Nations.</div></div> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Key Terms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ul><li><strong>American Indian: </strong>a term used to describe First people in the United States, still used&nbsp;today</li> <li><strong>Appropriation:</strong> the action of taking something for one’s own use, typically without the owner’s permission</li> <li><strong>Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People:</strong>&nbsp;a 2007 statement that set forth the minimum standards for the survival, dignity, and well-being of the indigenous peoples of the world</li> <li><strong>Eskimo</strong>: a term once used by non-Inuit people to describe Inuit people; no longer considered appropriate in Canada (however, still used in Alaska, US).</li> <li><strong>Export-ready criteria: </strong>the highest level of market readiness, with sophisticated travel distribution trade channels, to attract out-of-town visitors and highly reliable service standards, particularly with groups</li> <li><strong>First Nation:</strong> one of the three recognized groups of Canada’s Indigenous peoples (along with Inuit and Métis)</li> <li><strong>Indian (or Native Indian): </strong>a legal term in Canada, once used to describe Indigenous people but now considered inappropriate</li> <li><strong>Indigenous cultural experiences:</strong> experiences that are offered in a manner that is appropriate, respectful, and true to the Indigenous culture being portrayed</li> <li><strong>Indigenous cultural tourism:</strong> Indigenous tourism that incorporates Indigenous culture as a significant portion of the experience in a manner that is appropriate, respectful, and true</li> <li><strong>Indigenous tourism:</strong> tourism businesses that are majority&nbsp;owned and operated by First Nations, Métis, and Inuit</li> <li><strong>Indigenous peoples:</strong> groups specially protected in international or national legislation as having a set of specific rights based on their historical ties to a particular territory, and their cultural or historical distinctiveness from other populations.

The Hmong are indigenous to Southern China, however they were forced to migrate to areas in Myanmar, Thailand, Laos and Vietnam in the mid-1800’s.</p> <p>As tourism to the region has increased since the early 1990’s, so to has the economic opportunities as well as potential and real impacts. However, the benefits of tourism have not been equitably shared with everyone. Many of Sa Pa’s ethnic minorities either do not gain from the burgeoning sector, or are limited to selling handicraft-souvenirs to tourists on the streets.</p> <p>Community-based tourism projects supported by Capilano University, North Island College, and Ha Noi Open University, and funded by the Canadian International Development Agency and the Pacific Asia Travel Association Foundation, led to an evolution in sustainable practices as well as increased tourism revenues coming into the ethnic minority communities. Projects such as training and homestay development began in the villages of Ta Van and Ta Phin, and after some promising steps forward there, a project was replicated in Black Hmong village of Lao Chai.</p> <p>Lao Chai used to be just a lunch stop for tourists trekking through the beautiful, mountainous region. Over a period of many years, training and capacity-building activities were undertaken by the local Black Hmong people with the support of project volunteers. The fascinating culture, the hospitality of the community, and new trekking routes changed the role of Lao Chai. With the development of homestays the village is now seen as a suitable place for an overnight stay.</p> <p>A potential threat to the rights of the ethnic minorities and the village products has been the lack of inclusion and participation in decision making and tourism planning. This was evident during the development of Hoang Lien Son National Park. To protect this regional mountain range, authorities increased the borders of the park, encroaching on traditionally important natural resources for local villages. Additional challenges have arisen because the Vietnamese hold the majority of government positions and own the majority of tourism businesses in the region. Large scale tourism development projects, such as a gondola, have shifted economic priorities to attracting mass tourism markets. Access to education, language and racism are just some of the factors hegemonizing minority people like the Black Hmong.</p> <p>Despite these challenges, and with the support of students and faculty from Capilano University and Ha Noi Open University, residents of Lao Chai have set up small shops and a restaurant that attract visitors. Homestays have been certified, allowing guests to enjoy an overnight experience in the village as part of a Black Hmong family. Partnerships have been fostered between private sector tour operators and the local communities. Local government and regional tourism authorities have been supportive of tourism development in the villages. As entrepreneurial activities by the local ethnic minorities have proved successful, other individuals and communities have worked to train and make investments in their own tourism ventures.</p> <p>Watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5i-2roDGE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5i-2roDGE">video </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5i-2roDGE" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw5i-2roDGE">The Black Hmong of Lao Chai Village</a></em> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg9aNvmVvM0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg9aNvmVvM0">video </a><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg9aNvmVvM0" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jg9aNvmVvM0">The Black Hmong and a Different Way of Life</a></em> on YouTube and answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>What were some of the challenges to establishing tourism in the Lao Chai community?</li> <li>Review the Larrakia Declaration mentioned earlier in this chapter.

Tensions rose between European settlers and the Métis, whose rights had been eroded. In 1885, the North-West Resistance (formerly known as the North-West Rebellion) concluded with the hanging of resistance leader Louis Riel and eight other Indigenous leaders (Trails of 1885, 2015).</p> <p>In the years since, residents of Saskatchewan have protected areas from major interpretive centres to remote meadows and hillsides where solitary historic markers recount stories from an almost mythical past.</p> <p>In 2006, a small group of tourism developers and historic site managers gathered in Saskatoon to discuss how these locations and their stories could be brought together and enhanced to collectively attract more visitors to the region.</p> <p>As detailed in <em>Cultural and Heritage Tourism: A Handbook for Community Champion</em>s, their project included:</p> <ul><li>Creating an&nbsp;inventory of 1885-related sites and stories</li> <li>Meeting with site stakeholders to gauge interest in the project</li> <li>Acknowledging that First Nations and Métis stories&nbsp;had been previously overlooked</li> <li>Creating the 1885 coalition (Elders, accommodations, tourism organizations,&nbsp;tourism attractions, museums, tour operators)</li> <li>Reaching beyond Saskatchewan (the site of the main historical event) to Alberta and Manitoba sites related to the story of the North-West Resistance</li> <li>Finding funding, striking a steering committee, and finding a project manager</li> <li>Navigating culturally sensitive issues including the language of program delivery</li> <li>Creating visuals and branding (including the Trails of 1885 brand itself)</li> </ul> <p>The project relied on the participation of various stakeholder groups and the leadership of a local champion. As a result of their efforts, an elk-hide proclamation was signed by First Nations, the Métis Nation, and federal and provincial governments.</p> <p>Numerous other major events were held throughout the year including the first-ever reenactment of the Battle of Poundmaker Cree Nation and other 1885 ceremonies in communities across the region. The added impact of Trails of 1885 resulted in the largest attendance of the annual Métis homecoming festival (Back to Batoche Days).</p> <p>To support long-term tourism benefits to the region, these activities were reinforced by capital projects such as highway improvements (to the sites), highway and site signage, large maps at various 1885 sites, and multi-million dollar improvements at Batoche.&nbsp;After this multi-year project, a new non-profit corporation, Trails of 1885 Association,&nbsp;was created to extend the work into the future and promote the region as a long-term tourism draw.</p> <p>According to one of the initiative’s leaders, “the project has certainly met one of its main goals—to increase visitation and visitor satisfaction, while developing First Nations and Métis cultural awareness locally, regionally, provincially, and nationally” (LinkBC, 2012, p. 66).</p> <p>Visit the site at <a href="http://www.trailsof1885.com" data-url="http://www.trailsof1885.com">Trails of 1885 website</a> and answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>List two attractions in each of the three provinces that span this project. What do they have in common?</li> <li>List five stakeholder groups who participated in the development of Trails of 1885. How might their interests differ? How might they align? Name three benefits of having these partners work together.</li> <li>What kind of tours are available to visitors wanting to learn more about this time in Canada’s history?</li> <li>Based on the website, where would you say the Trails of 1885 falls on the readiness scale (visitor ready, market ready, export ready)? Why would you classify it in this way?</li> <li>Go back to the Larrakia Declaration and create a checklist made up of the statements.

It is through career planning that a person evaluates abilities and interests, assesses values and personality, considers alternative career opportunities, establishes career goals, and plans practical developmental activities.</p> <p>Career planning requires individuals to understand themselves and their values, interests, and skills. It is also an ongoing process, one that must be repeated with changes in employment and life circumstances. As you gain more experience and knowledge, the process will begin anew.</p> <p>This section reviews the five essential steps of career planning, which are&nbsp;based on our research and input from industry experts:</p> <ol><li>Conduct a self-assessment</li> <li>Research the labour market</li> <li>Create your career search toolkit</li> <li>Put your career campaign into action</li> <li>Engage in networking</li> </ol> <p>Let’s start at step one.</p> <h1>Step One: Conduct a Self-Assessment</h1> <p>Self knowledge is the key to choosing a career. It can be overwhelming to begin the process of self-assessment. However, if done well at the start, the likelihood of securing work that has meaning, purpose, and fulfillment is far greater. Understanding your preferences, knowing your strengths, and honestly facing the areas you need to develop are the first steps for effective self-assessment.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Tourism Careers from the Tourism HR Canada<br /> </strong></p> <p>The Tourism HR Canada has a website that can help you explore career options. Start with its <a href="http://tourismhr.ca/discover-tourism/take-a-tourism-career-quiz/is-tourism-for-me/" data-url="http://tourismhr.ca/discover-tourism/take-a-tourism-career-quiz/is-tourism-for-me/">tourism career quiz</a> to see where you might find a fit, and browse the list of job boards and other resources on their website.</p> </div> <p>Rosenberg McKay (2014) identifies <span class="glossary-term">self-assessment</span> as “the process of gathering information about you in order to make a knowledgeable career decision” and adds that “a self-assessment should examine values, interests, personality, and skills.” Your <span class="glossary-term">values</span> should guide your decision making to ensure a good fit for both you and your employer.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Explore Careers by Skills and Knowledge</strong></p> <p>The Government of Canada Job Bank website allows you to peruse occupations and explore the skills and knowledge required to work in these fields. Discover what jobs might be a good match for you at&nbsp;the <a href="http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/es_all-eng.do" data-url="http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/es_all-eng.do">Government of Canada Job Bank</a>.</p> </div> <p>Many people find that over the course of their post-secondary program they naturally become more self-aware. It’s recommended, however, that you take time to do the following in order to facilitate your understanding:</p> <ol><li>Think back to when you were a child. What hopes and dreams did you have for yourself? How have these changed?</li> <li>Develop a profile of your personality type. One helpful way of classifying personalities was developed by Myers and Briggs. You can learn more about their personality types by visiting their foundation at <a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/" data-url="http://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/mbti-basics/">Myers-Briggs Personality Types</a>.</li> <li>Do an internet search for terms like <em>personal value statement</em> and find examples that inspire you. These may include key words such as loyalty, accountability, determination, and passion. Now create your own unique statement that reflects where you are today.</li> <li>Gain a better understanding of yourself by learning how others see you. Ask a close friend, family member, or trusted academic contact to write down 10 key words that describe you. Notice where these are different or similar to the words you chose for your value statement.</li> <li>Go back to the <a class="internal" href="#naics" data-url="/introtourism2e/chapter/what-is-tourism/#naics">introductory chapter</a> of this textbook and make note of the five key sectors of the tourism industry. With a highlighter or similar tool, choose the two sectors that are the most appealing to you. Why are these of interest? What life experiences or work experience do you have that apply to these sectors? How do they align with your personality type and values?</li> </ol> <p>With this foundation in place, you’re ready to face employment reality by gaining a greater understanding of the labour market.</p> <h1>Step Two: Research the Labour Market</h1> <p>Whether you are career planning for the very&nbsp;first&nbsp;time or you are trying to&nbsp;change careers, gathering labour market information is necessary to ensure your education and training are relevant. Keep in mind that a career is distinct from a job. A job can be a part-time or short-term position, whereas a career is work you plan to explore for the length of your professional life, with each employment opportunity building on the last.</p> <p>Learning as much as you can about careers within the tourism and hospitality industry will allow you to make good decisions about your future. Some of the activities you can do to complete your research include visiting job boards to identify demand and following companies and sectors in the media.&nbsp;Let’s look at these concepts in more detail.</p> <h2>Visit Tourism and Hospitality Job Boards to Identify Demand</h2> <p>It’s not enough for you to want to work in a certain field — you have to know what types of jobs are currently being offered. By visiting job boards you can get a sense of which geographic areas have more opportunities, how much different jobs pay, and what kind of experience is required.</p> <p>Websites you can use for this search include:</p> <ul><li>The <a href="https://www.go2hr.ca/jobboard" data-url="https://www.go2hr.ca/jobboard">go2HR job board for tourism and hospitality jobs in BC</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.hcareers.com/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.hcareers.com/">Hospitality Works (H Careers)</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.hotelleriejobs.com/en" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.hotelleriejobs.com/en">HotellerieJobs</a></li> <li>Listings specific to resort communities, such as the <a href="http://whistlerchamber.chambermaster.com/jobs" data-url="http://whistlerchamber.chambermaster.com/jobs">Whistler Job Board</a></li> <li>Career pages for companies, such as <a href="https://careers.accor.com/global/en/fairmont-jobs" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://careers.accor.com/global/en/fairmont-jobs">Job Opportunities with Fairmont</a> and <a href="http://joeyrestaurants.com/careers/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://joeyrestaurants.com/careers/">JOEY Restaurants Careers</a></li> </ul> <p>Make note of any interesting positions, and pay attention to gaps. Compare this to your self-assessment. Where are the opportunities lining up? What changes might you have to make to advance your career? For example, if you’d like to stay in the same city, but see no jobs posted that match your needs, it might be time to look elsewhere.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:<br /> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1757#h5p-50" title="What Job Boards Could You Use for your Job Search?" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1757#h5p-50">https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1757#h5p-50</a> </p> </div> <h2>Follow Companies and Sectors in the Media</h2> <p>Make it a point to follow companies and sectors of interest to you in the media. You can do this by using a search engine to set up notifications (e.g., Google Alerts) about sectors (e.g., restaurants, ski resorts), and following companies on social media (Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram). You can also monitor news from industry associations to read their commentary on issues and trends affecting specific sectors of the industry and/or geographic regions. This will help you identify growth patterns, understand job market trends, and gain an edge should you have the opportunity to interview.</p> <p>With this information in hand, you’ll be ready to create a plan.</p> <h1>Step Three: Create Your Career Search Toolkit</h1> <p>You have completed your initial research, and now you need to get down to business!&nbsp;This step involves getting&nbsp;ready to approach employers about specific opportunities.</p> <p>Identify, and be prepared to provide evidence of, the attributes and skills you possess that would be attractive to an employer. It can be helpful to review these in three categories:</p> <ol><li><span class="glossary-term">Personal attributes</span>: describe what you are like as a person/employee (e.g., your values, personality type, personal qualities, and characteristics)</li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Technical skills</span>: skills and knowledge required to perform specific work (e.g., how to use restaurant Point-of-Sale systems, hotel&nbsp;reservations systems, or other computer software)</li> <li><span class="glossary-term">Transferable skills</span>: skills required to perform a variety of tasks&nbsp;that can be transferred from one type of job&nbsp;to another (e.g., the ability to read a balance sheet and prepare a budget)</li> </ol> <p>Use the list of your skills and attributes when you describe yourself in your&nbsp;documents.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1756" style="width: 550px"><img class="wp-image-1755" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card.jpg" alt="A stylized set of resumes and business cards with a minimalist logo." width="550" height="368" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-300x201.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-1024x686.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-768x514.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-1536x1028.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-225x151.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Green-Resume-CV-Business-Card-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.2 Consider a branded set of tools, like resumes and business cards, to help you stand out from the crowd.</div></div> <p>A standard set of job search documents includes:</p> <ol><li>Cover letter: a long-form document of one page that tells a story, illustrating how your skills and experience make you an ideal candidate for the job.</li> <li>Resume (sometimes called a curriculum vitae or CV): a point-form document, typically two pages, that includes&nbsp;your career objective, relevant experience, education, skills, and interests.</li> <li>Reference list: identifies three or four professional contacts who have worked with you, and can vouch for the quality of your work.</li> </ol> <p>Be&nbsp;sure to update these documents each time you apply for a position&nbsp;and customize them to the opportunity at hand.</p> <p>You may also want to consider using social media tools and resources to promote yourself. This may include creating a LinkedIn profile, making a professional (rather than personal) Facebook page, and using Twitter and Instagram to communicate with companies. Some job seekers also use a professional e-portfolio to demonstrate their skills, knowledge, and abilities. Showcasing your experiences with an e-portfolio is one way to stand out from other applicants (Lorenzo &amp; Ittleson, 2005).</p> <h1>Step Four: Put Your Career Campaign into Action</h1> <p>Now it’s time to make a list of companies to target, and to approach them.</p> <p>We’ve already addressed how you can find opportunities by scanning postings on websites like the go2HR job board. This is a great start, but most work opportunities are found in the <span class="glossary-term">hidden job market</span>, which consists of&nbsp;jobs that are not advertised or made public in traditional ways. Many individuals find work in BC’s tourism and hospitality industry by being&nbsp;referred, getting hired&nbsp;by someone they already know, or starting at an entry-level position and waiting for future growth opportunities.</p> <p>If you don’t have any connections in tourism and hospitality,&nbsp;make them!&nbsp;List&nbsp;all the organizations you’re interested in working for. Now find some key contacts to meet with. These might be:</p> <ul><li>The person&nbsp;responsible for hiring within the organization (as noted on its website or in its directory)</li> <li>An alumni from your program already working for the company (ask a faculty member to connect you)</li> <li>The person who currently works in your&nbsp;ideal role within the company</li> <li>A personal contact (family member, friend, or acquaintance) working at the company</li> </ul> <p>Approach your potential contact to set up an <span class="glossary-term">informational interview</span>. This is a session where you make contact with individuals&nbsp;who can use their first-hand experience to educate you about a particular role or company.</p> <p>Write a short script that will help you remain focused and appear&nbsp;professional as you embark on your first call or send an&nbsp;initial email. Here’s a sample:</p> <blockquote><p>I have five years’ experience working in the tourism and/or hospitality field, mainly holding front-end positions. I have increased return visitor numbers and received continuous feedback about my outstanding customer service focus. I am wondering if you have 10 minutes to speak with me.</p></blockquote> <p>Your script will change depending on who you are targeting. Prepare a list of questions you want to ask. Remember, at this stage, you are not asking for a job; you’re asking for advice and gathering information. Don’t ask obvious questions about information&nbsp;already available on the company’s website or in its print material. Some questions might include:</p> <ul><li>What are three words you would use to describe the culture of this company?</li> <li>In the time that you’ve worked here, would you say the company has grown? What has changed? What has stayed the same?</li> <li>What is a day-in-the-life of someone in (name a role) at this company?</li> <li>What salary range is available for entry-level employees?</li> <li>What types of training and career path support is offered to employees?</li> <li>Are there any other people I should be talking to about this? If possible, could you give me their contact information or introduce me to them?</li> </ul> <p>The conversation should be professional but informal in nature, and many of your questions will be answered in the natural flow of the conversation. Take notes as you move through the interview, and&nbsp;take a minute after the interview to fill in details you may have missed while you were there.</p> <p>After the session, always send a thank-you note. Thank the person&nbsp;for his or her time, and add something specific you learned in the interview that you believe will be helpful as you navigate your career. Sending an email thank-you is fine, but&nbsp; sending&nbsp;a&nbsp;written card will help you stand out.</p> <p>If you’re given the name of someone else to contact, or you are asked to provide further information, be sure to follow through. This is your opportunity to make a good impression on your contact, and the organization.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Just as you need to continue to learn and develop your skill sets, you need to develop and nurture your network; it’s an investment in your future.&nbsp;Some ways to do this&nbsp;include:</p> <ul><li>Conducting multiple informational&nbsp;interviews (covered in the previous step)</li> <li>Maintaining contact with&nbsp;academic classmates/faculty</li> <li>Attending and presenting at conferences</li> <li>Participating&nbsp;in case study competitions and other academic&nbsp;contests</li> <li>Using social media networks and groups</li> <li>Maintaining good relationships with coworkers at your current job, and staying in touch with people when they leave</li> <li>Asking family and friends to introduce&nbsp;you to tourism and hospitality professionals in their network</li> </ul> <p>Remember that <span class="glossary-term">networking</span> is equally&nbsp;about who you know and&nbsp;who knows you; it works both ways. Be&nbsp;generous with your contacts, information, and resources. As a new professional, you may not have a developed network, but you can offer your great attitude and valuable ideas, and you will soon gain a reputation as someone who contributes to the field.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1756" style="width: 550px"><img class="wp-image-1756" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Rendezvous-2013.jpg" alt="A crowd of students dressed in business clothes.

Experiential&nbsp;learning is:</p> <ul><li>Action-oriented</li> <li>Learner-centred</li> <li>Geared toward process, rather than&nbsp;outcomes</li> </ul> <p>In this way, knowledge is created as the learner moves through the experience.</p> <p>Through your educational program, you may be able to participate in a variety of different learning experiences in tourism and hospitality. Students who participate in a learning experience outside of the classroom are more likely to enter the field with both academic and practical workplace skills and knowledge, and have more opportunities for career advancement.</p> <h1>Work Experience Examples</h1> <p>Let’s have a look at some of the common types of work learning experiences:</p> <ul><li>Co-op education</li> <li>Internship</li> <li>Practicum</li> <li>Service learning</li> <li>Volunteering</li> </ul> <p>Each of these is&nbsp;defined below.</p> <h2>Co-op Education</h2> <p>Co-operative, or <span class="glossary-term">co-op education</span> refers to “a structured program that integrates work experience in a student’s field along with academic studies by alternating in-class learning with periods of actual work” (ContactPoint, 2014b, para. 1). The term reflects the co-operative relationship between students, schools, and employers.</p> <h2>Internship</h2> <p>An <span class="glossary-term">internship</span> is a temporary on-the-job experience that is “typically offered to students or inexperienced workers” (ContactPoint, 2014c, para. 1). It is generally project-oriented, and supervised.</p> <p>The intern should have&nbsp;specific learning goals against which he or she can apply&nbsp;experience about a particular industry or field of work. The term&nbsp;may be paid or unpaid, and may lead to permanent career opportunities with the organization (ContactPoint, 2014b).</p> <h2>Practicum</h2> <p>A <span class="glossary-term">practicum</span>&nbsp;is “applied learning that provides students with practical experience and interaction with professionals from industry and the community outside of school” (ConnectEd, 2011, p.3). The goal is to support career readiness and help enhance:</p> <ul><li>Higher-order thinking</li> <li>Academic skills</li> <li>Technical skills</li> <li>Applied workplace skills</li> </ul> <p>The experience may be paid or unpaid.</p> <h2>Service Learning</h2> <p><span class="glossary-term">Service learning</span> is defined as a course-based, credit-bearing educational experience in which students:</p> <ul><li>Participate in an organized service activity that meets identified community needs</li> <li>Reflect on the service activity to gain further understanding of course content, a broader appreciation of the discipline, and an enhanced sense of civic responsibility (Bringle &amp; Hatcher, 1995)</li> </ul> <h2>Volunteering</h2> <p><span class="glossary-term">Volunteering</span> involves performing a service without pay in order to obtain work experience, learn new skills, meet people, contribute to community, and contribute to a cause that’s important to the volunteer (for example, helping animals, supporting elderly people, working for an&nbsp;environmental cause)&nbsp;(Pickerell, 2014).</p> <h1><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text. You can view it online here:<br /> <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1759#h5p-53" title="Common Types of Work Learning Experiences" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1759#h5p-53">https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/?p=1759#h5p-53</a> </h1> <h1>Benefits of Work Experience Programs</h1> <p>Students who have completed a formal work experience component benefit from a&nbsp;supportive partnership between&nbsp;the educational institution, the employer, and themselves. This partnership encourages&nbsp;community stakeholder investment, student learning opportunities, professional networks, as well as opportunities for employers to participate as co-educators.</p> <p>Some institutions may work with an experiential education coordinator to ensure a particular position meets the school’s criteria. Depending on your program, remuneration for work can&nbsp;be by the hour, by salary, by a&nbsp;stipend, as in-kind contributions (experiences or services from the business), or as a volunteer assignment. The educational institution may monitor your placement&nbsp;and ask you to complete an assignment where you reflect on the work experience. Some programs may have an evaluation component and a supervisor who supports the student’s learning. Students are also evaluated by the employer, and they will have a supervisor whom they report to directly.</p> <p>Most often, for students to participate in a work experience program, they are&nbsp;required to maintain a certain grade point average (GPA) set by the school. Often students are also asked to establish learning goals prior to starting their work experience.</p> <p>If your program doesn’t offer a formal work experience program such as a co-op, internship, or practicum, you can still gain valuable hands-on learning through part-time work and volunteer opportunities.&nbsp;Because tourism is the number-one employer of youth in BC, you can find a part-time job to develop&nbsp;your skills and gain an entry-level opportunity to join the industry.</p> <p>Whatever experience you engage in, be it formal, or informal, it’s important to:</p> <ul><li>Explore your employer’s organizational culture and social norms</li> <li>Do your best on the job</li> <li>Gain conflict management and resolution skills</li> </ul> <p>These three keys come directly from BC tourism and hospitality employers (LinkBC, 2014), and are explored in the next section.</p> </div></div>

Here, students are talking to a representative from West Coast Sightseeing. <a class="internal" href="#fig13.4" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/chapter/integrating-planning-with-education-and-experience/#fig13.4">[Long Description]</a></div></div> <p>You will want to understand the culture of an organization before applying for a job there to ensure your values are congruent.&nbsp;Find out what’s important to the organization by researching the business. How does it present its public face?</p> <p>Asking questions of a potential employer about the organization’s culture will help you assess whether it is a good fit for you. You can do this by asking employees in the organization during the informational interview; or alternatively, in a formal job interview.</p> <h1>Performance on the Job</h1> <p>This is your time to shine — no matter what role you’ve been assigned. In addition to respecting and working within a company’s culture, once you start your position, it’s time for you to show initiative (Iannarino, n.d.). Demonstrate an interest in learning and contributing to the organization’s goals and objectives and you will stand out from other employees.</p> <p>Act without waiting to be told what to do and persistently follow through on work responsibilities, regardless of the obstacles. Think about ways to improve operations, and come up with new ideas, while presenting these in a way that shows you respect management’s expertise. It’s up to you to signal&nbsp;to your employer that you’re someone who can be counted on and you have leadership potential. Some ways of showing initiative include:</p> <ul><li>Asking to observe a meeting</li> <li>Asking to shadow a manager in another department</li> <li>Reading through company policies and plans, and asking questions about them</li> <li>Offering to bring your skills to the table to make a difference,&nbsp;such as setting up a social media account for the company or creating a training manual for future students in your position</li> </ul> <p>Often, you’ll be able to take advantage of project work at school to accomplish some of the above.</p> <h1>Practise Conflict Management and Resolution</h1> <p>The majority of tourism and hospitality employers stress that <span class="glossary-term">conflict management</span> is an essential skill in this customer-service driven industry (LinkBC, 2014). It’s up to you to practise these skills at your workplace.</p> <p>In most conflicts, the ultimate goal must be to find a resolution. Avoiding&nbsp;or ignoring conflict&nbsp;is not an effective strategy. While resolving conflict can be uncomfortable, unresolved conflict actually makes the situation&nbsp;worse. Generally, conflicts have more than one cause. How you choose to resolve conflicts will ultimately demonstrate your&nbsp;ability to be professional and move upward in your career.</p> <p>Consider the following three steps to resolving conflicts both at work and in the classroom.</p> <h2>Listen</h2> <p>If at all possible, try not to take the situation or comments&nbsp;personally.&nbsp;Do not&nbsp;make assumptions about people’s motivations. Jumping to conclusions adds to the conflict and creates more tension and issues to work though.</p> <p>Consider that if there is a conflict, you might not&nbsp;have fully understood the issue&nbsp;or your part in it. While you&nbsp;may not like the style or approach of the person you’re interacting with, set the goal of&nbsp;listening with acceptance with the intent to resolve the conflict. Convey that you are listening respectfully through your body language and tone of voice, and don’t interrupt. If there are several people involved, let everyone have a chance to speak.</p> <h2>Reflect and Summarize</h2> <p>If you need to, silently count to 10 in your head to give yourself the time to respond appropriately.&nbsp;Acknowledge your commitment to resolving the conflict, and clarify how the other person is feeling about it. When people feel listened to, they are often willing to take the first step toward trust, which then creates willingness to work through the issue. Summarizing what the other person has said allows you to ensure that you’ve fully captured his or her position.</p> <p>Focus on appreciating what the other person is saying and thinking to understand the source of conflict. Ask what the other person believes would resolve&nbsp;the conflict. Focus the conversation on mutually resolving the issue.</p> <h2>Respond</h2> <p>Allow&nbsp;each person the opportunity to explore solutions equally. Take a break from the process if you need to, and come back to the conflict when you feel refreshed. Often the solution is through compromise, because no one is all wrong or all right in any given situation. Each time you’re given the chance to respond, do your best to keep language neutral.</p> <p>By maturely moving through the process of listening, reflecting, summarizing, and responding (and sometimes going back to the start again), you’ll not only demonstrate your workplace potential, but gain valuable skills for your personal life.</p> <p>While adapting to organizational&nbsp;culture, demonstrating strong on-the-job performance, and practising&nbsp;conflict resolution are important, there are many skills to be learned in the workplace. Others include&nbsp;the ability to apply critical thinking, acting as a global citizen, and working as part of a team. With this in mind,&nbsp;let’s have a look at success stories in our industry&nbsp;— graduates who possess these skills and attributes, and have used them to propel their careers forward.</p> <h1><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

He graduated with a bachelor of hospitality management at Vancouver Community College in 2010. Brock says:</p> <blockquote><p>I oversee more than&nbsp;300 accommodations on Vancouver Island and am their point of contact for day-to-day support and for assisting them in maximizing their listing’s potential with Booking.com. When I moved to Vancouver in 2004, I started my first hotel job at the Westin Bayshore as a banquet server. I still remember my first day; we had to serve a dinner for over 1,200 people, and I remember that despite how crazy it was I knew this was the industry for me!</p> <p>From there, I moved to the Pacific Palisades Hotel in banquets, and then I was given an opportunity to move to the front desk. I remember thinking at first that I didn’t belong at the front desk as I had always just done food and beverage. I did not think I would fit the position. Well, I was wrong! I immediately knew I loved the interactions with the guests.</p> <p>I progressed with my career, moving from a front desk agent to an assistant front office manager, where I stayed until the hotel unfortunately closed its doors in 2010. Following the Palisades, I held various front office management positions with Coast Hotels and Delta Hotels in Vancouver, Nanaimo, and Whistler. In 2013, I was presented with an opportunity to join Booking.com as an account manager, where I am presently working.</p> <p>Taking courses related to hospitality management and tourism will really assist in developing your career.&nbsp;Once in a workplace setting, continued education is key. Look for opportunities for cross training and job shadowing, and ask Human Resources about internal training programs to further your understanding.</p> <p>Students entering this industry need to have a passion for guest services and for helping people. They need to be able to think quickly and be a good problem solver. This is a fast-paced, ever-evolving industry and doesn’t fit someone who likes routine. No two days are ever the same, and that is what I love! Remain flexible and do not be afraid to try new things. Have an open mind and challenge yourself to think outside of the box.</p> <p>Specific things students can do to get ahead include networking, further training, and volunteering. Remember, the industry is very large, yet small at the same time. Take opportunities to volunteer as these are great networking opportunities as well. I couldn’t picture myself in any other industry. It is challenging, yet rewarding, and best of all, it is a lot of fun!</p></blockquote> <h2>Katie Clarke, Marketing&nbsp;Coordinator</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1770" style="width: 189px"><img class="size-full wp-image-1765" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Katelyn-Clarke-by-Vivian-Kereki.jpg" alt="A headshot of a young woman in a red top by the ocean." width="189" height="275" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Katelyn-Clarke-by-Vivian-Kereki.jpg 189w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Katelyn-Clarke-by-Vivian-Kereki-65x95.jpg 65w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.6 Katie Clarke.</div></div> <p>Katie works at the Parkside Hotel &amp; Spa in Victoria, BC. She graduated with a diploma in hospitality management from Vancouver Island University in 2011. Katie says:</p> <blockquote><p>My initial hotel job was with the Fairmont Empress housekeeping department during my first co-op work term,&nbsp;a temporary two-month position after which I returned for my second year of schooling. After graduating from Vancouver Island University, I completed my last co-op semester by working at the Queen Victoria Hotel and Suites as a guest services agent. My employment continued there&nbsp;after my co-op term was complete, and lasted until the hotel was sold in October 2012. I left with a wealth of knowledge in guest services.</p> <p>I began working at the Parkside Hotel &amp; Spa at the time it was purchased by a group of Vancouver Island local investors. I started in reservations, which was a new department in the early stages of development, and my skills and qualifications played a large role in assisting with the department’s foundations. I worked as a reservations agent for seven months before I was promoted to the position of rooms division coordinator. In this position, I assisted in supervising the department, as well as taking on some marketing responsibilities such as keeping the hotel website up-to-date, social media, print materials, and much, much more. The role became a jack-of-all-trades position and was&nbsp;a great experience! In fact, I used what I learned in that role to obtain my current position of marketing coordinator.</p> <p>My advice for students is that&nbsp;any related education will always help get your foot in the door of a hotel. All applicable work experience, skills, and knowledge can also be an advantage. If you are a hard worker, a team player, and willing to help out when other departments need it, you will be successful in any job you do.</p> <p>Students should understand that the hospitality field can be a career. Some people view a job in the hospitality industry as temporary or seasonal employment, but it can be a career with many exciting opportunities if you stick with it. The great thing about working in a hotel is that there are so many different departments to explore. The options are endless.</p> <p>Networking can provide an advantage in this industry. If you contact your tourism bureau, it can connect you to organizations to help you further your industry network. Creating great workplace relationships also fosters getting ahead in any industry. Be sure to keep up with new training and volunteering, as that can be a great advantage, and most workplaces encourage it!</p> <p>Though every job will come with its tough days, push past them as there are so many better days ahead! Work hard and it will pay off!</p></blockquote> <h1>Recreation and Entertainment</h1> <h2>Anna Rowinska, Project Coordinator</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1770" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1766" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-300x225.jpg" alt="A young woman on a European street carries a map and a camera." width="500" height="375" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski-350x263.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Anna-Rowinska-by-Karl-Rowinski.jpg 1000w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.7 Anna Rowinska.</div></div> <p>Anna works for MCI Group Canada. She has multiple credentials including a hospitality restaurant management diploma from Douglas College (2005), an Event Marketing Association certificate from BCIT (2008), and a bachelor of tourism management from Capilano University (2013). Anna says:</p> <blockquote><p>My love for travel and hospitality were key reasons I took the hospitality restaurant management diploma program at Douglas College. After receiving my diploma, I decided to focus on event marketing and enrolled at BCIT for further training.</p> <p>Students interested in getting into events and or event marketing need to be able to multi-task, be organized, and have a hard work ethic. Both education and experience are important to work as an event coordinator. You need to know the ins and outs of the industry by working in events, and you also need to understand the back-end strategies of how to implement, organize, and plan events.</p> <p>The events industry is not your typical nine-to-five&nbsp;job. Long workdays are common, and you can expect to sometimes work 16 or more hours in one day to get the job done.&nbsp;Events can happen any day of the week, at any time. Commitment and the ability to be flexible is key as you are always the first one on scene and the last one to leave. You need to have patience, be organized, and be able to deal with stress.</p> <p>Many students expect to be hired at at a high level right after graduation, but in truth, most will be entering the workforce in their respective fields in an entry-level position. You’ll need to be prepared to work toward gaining experience with your company before you can move into a supervisor or manager position. My advice is to work hard, learn, and ask questions, and you will succeed.</p> <p>Volunteering or working part time with events is key as you will not only gain valuable industry experience, you will also be networking with your future peers. Experience is invaluable in our sector, so the more events you work or volunteer in, the more opportunities you will have to expand your network and meet key stakeholders in the event industry.</p> <p>To be successful, you need to be organized, have excellent communication skills, and be able to handle stress and pressure. Don’t get discouraged if things don’t happen exactly like you planned; life throws you curve balls, and it’s how you deal with those curve balls that allows you to succeed in our industry.</p> <p>Throughout my career, I have needed to make decisions on what was next for me. You never know which job may lead you to where, so treat each job as a stepping stone to move ahead in your career.</p></blockquote> <h2>Christine McCann, Senior Conference Services Manager</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1770" style="width: 250px"><img class="wp-image-1767" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-178x300.jpg" alt="A head-and-shoulders shot of a young woman with a name tag posing in a hotel lobby." width="250" height="420" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-178x300.jpg 178w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-609x1024.jpg 609w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-768x1291.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-914x1536.jpg 914w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-65x109.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-225x378.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink-350x589.jpg 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Christine-McCann-by-Beth-Pink.jpg 1218w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.8 Christine McCann.</div></div> <p>Christine is in senior management at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler. She graduated from the Douglas College program in hotel and restaurant management in 2006. Christine says:</p> <blockquote><p>I started at the Fairmont Chateau Whistler as a SWEP (student work experience) student in the banquet department. From there,&nbsp;I became very interested in the organization and execution of events, weddings, and&nbsp;conferences. During my time as a banquet server, I was able to cross train with conference services, allowing me to gain insights into the skills and knowledge required to be a successful member of the that team. When a position opened up for a conference services coordinator, I was overjoyed to receive a role as part of this fantastic team! Seven years have passed, and I am now in the position of senior conference services manager, taking care of many large groups throughout the year.</p> <p>Event and conference planning is a very interesting blend of roles: being on the floor with clients and groups but also completing many administrative tasks and paperwork to ensure plans are effectively communicated. A positive attitude, passion for creating outstanding events, and an eye for detail are three key qualities needed. Members of my team have moved here from many other departments, including banquets, front office, sales, and&nbsp;food and beverage; however, having a base of operations experience is the normal pathway to a position in conference services.</p> <p>Being successful in a conference services role takes passion and an understanding and appreciation for the guest experience. We are ambassadors for our brand to our guests — 100 to 1,000 guests at a time — and it is important that we ensure each one feels a special connection to our venue and location.</p> <p>A positive attitude, willingness to learn and passion for whatever role you choose will always help you on the road to success.</p> <p>Volunteering is a fantastic way to try out new roles and meet great contacts. Hands-on experience can be invaluable in the future. Continuing to seek knowledge, through training, education, industry events — whatever method is interesting for you — will also be beneficial.</p> <p>Love what you do, work hard, and&nbsp;listen!</p></blockquote> <h2>David Wooldridge, Entrepreneur and Small Business Owner</h2> <p>David is the owner and founder of Ridge Wilderness Adventures Ltd. He graduated from the outdoor recreation management program at Capilano University&nbsp;in 2002. David says:</p> <blockquote><p>I love people and I love being outside,&nbsp;so I searched for positions that would fill that need. I have worked at canoe rental companies, guiding outfits, first-aid schools, retail shops, construction, and anything else that I could get my hands on.</p> <p>I recommend students get into the field by one of two means: enter a specific program like the one at Capilano University, or contact a company that does the work they would like to do and apply. If applying directly doesn’t work, ask the company what it is looking for in a person to be employable.</p> <p>This work is for those who don’t like to have a fixed routine and who thrive on problem solving and like to do different things all the time. If you prefer a set schedule and set pay, it is probably not for you.</p> <p>It’s an amazing job where we get to work at what we love. To succeed in this line of work, attitude and availability trump aptitude. If you would like to have a lucrative career in the outdoors, you need to possess an outgoing, friendly, hardworking attitude. This style of work is not nine-to-five;&nbsp;in fact, it’s the opposite of that. Your ability to work when the work is there is key to success. Obviously, you need to have the ability to do the work, but 9 times out of 10, if that’s all you have you will not succeed.</p> <p>This industry is all about the people that you know. Go to every event and course you can to meet people and get known. Most places will give you the training; you need to do the work if your attitude is right, so sort out what you need before you start.</p> <p>If you love the outdoors, love people, and want to have fun for work, this is what you should do.</p></blockquote> <h1>Travel Services</h1> <h2>Cleopatra Corbett, Long-Range Planner</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1770" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-1768" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography.jpg" alt="A headshot of a young woman with a bright smile and curly hair." width="300" height="375" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography.jpg 480w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography-240x300.jpg 240w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography-65x81.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography-225x281.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Cleo-Corbett-by-Digital-Dean-Photography-350x438.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.9 Cleopatra Corbett.</div></div> <p>Cleopatra works as a planner for the City of Vernon.

For knowledge, you need&nbsp;planning history and theory, community development, environmental stewardship, marketing, and statistical and research methods. As for education, you want to study&nbsp;planning, geography, urban design, tourism, recreation, history, and law.</p> <p>Community planning is incredibly challenging and rewarding work. Put simply, your work can have a tremendous impact on the environment and the quality of life for residents in your community. You help the community dream about a desired future and then develop policy to make it happen.</p> <p>My advice would be to have mentors you respect and admire, and to meet with them regularly to ask questions and look for advice. Always do your best, work hard with integrity, be kind, tell the truth, and do what you love.</p> <p>Get experience before graduating through volunteer work, internships, and/or co-op work terms. Also, try to apply course projects in university to real-world projects for businesses, non-profits, or governments in order to gain meaningful applied experience. Interview people who are in positions that interest you; ask questions and don’t be afraid to ask for help.</p> <p>If you are willing to move, you can get any type of job you desire.

She graduated from Capilano University with a diploma of tourism management in 2012. Marie-Catherine says:</p> <blockquote><p>When I graduated, I knew that I wanted to work in travel services as a central part of the industry with touch points in every other sector, so when a posting to be a travel designer for a receptive tour operator came up, I jumped at the chance. I was excited to be working to bring clients from all over the world to Canada, and I took in every opportunity to learn about the many aspects of the company, including product, marketing, and sales.</p> <p>Students wanting to get into the tour operator sector need to have a tourism education to really understand the intricacies of the sectors in the industry, as well as skills in customer service, sales, cultural practices (particularly dealing with international clients), marketing, and a real passion for the products they are selling. Teamwork is crucial on our small team, as is being intrinsically motivated to provide the best experience for clients.</p> <p>First,&nbsp;receptive tour operators are not travel agents, nor do they operate the tours. We work with travel agents, wholesale agents, and occasionally with clients directly. However, it is mainly a B2B model. Receptive tour operators are in a dynamic workplace, with opportunities to learn and gain experience in other sectors and fields, as well as hone customer service and sales skills.</p> <p>My advice is to really take hold of every opportunity that is presented, and to never stop learning about the industry. This is a very social industry and building a large solid network can help with future opportunities. Build up your customer service experience, whether it’s through front-line jobs or volunteering, and attend networking events. Schools often host or sponsor these, and students should be attending them all.</p> <p>This is a really fun industry, and with so many sectors and positions available, I really believe that there is something for everyone in tourism.</p></blockquote> <h2>Jody Young, Industry and Community Services Manager</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1770" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-1770" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson.jpg" alt="A young woman in business clothes sits at a conference table and smiles." width="300" height="414" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson.jpg 1483w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-217x300.jpg 217w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-742x1024.jpg 742w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-768x1061.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-1112x1536.jpg 1112w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-65x90.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-225x311.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Jody-Young-by-Landon-Sveinson-350x483.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 13.11 Jody Young.</div></div> <p>Jody works for Tourism Vancouver Island. She&nbsp;holds a bachelor of tourism management from Vancouver Island University (2008). Jody says:</p> <blockquote><p>After graduation, it took a year and a half before I got my big break into the industry. I’m thankful for the time it took for my career to really start as it provided me the opportunity to travel around Southeast Asia. I started at Tourism Vancouver Island in an entry-level position as the distribution coordinator. After just one year in the role I was promoted to industry services coordinator where I was coordinating the association’s annual conference and AGM and conducting accommodation inspections. After another year and a half,&nbsp;I was promoted again to management level within the organization to the role I am currently in. As industry and&nbsp;community services manager,&nbsp;I oversee many portfolios for the organization such as community tourism development, event management, research, and promotion of the value of tourism.</p> <p>The tourism management degree program at Vancouver Island University definitely set me up for success in this role. I highly recommend completing the four-year degree and getting as much hands-on, real-world experience that you can while completing your education. Employers will be looking for proven successes and workplace skills, not just completion of courses.</p> <p>Although the tourism industry is vast with many desirable, well-paying career opportunities, it is still fairly new. The industry has room to grow on communicating that it is a key economic and social contributor to our province and country.</p> <p>I would advise students to jump at an entry-level opportunity as it will be your door to advancing in your career in a particular organization. Once you’ve got your foot in the door, demonstrate your ability and you will soon find bigger opportunities presented to you.

This chapter explores the topic of globalization and how it relates to tourism, and then examines trends (political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental influences — <span class="glossary-term">PESTLE</span>). The chapter closes with a reflection on what all this means for tourism in British Columbia.</p> <p>Depending&nbsp;on the focus of the discussion, <span class="glossary-term">globalization</span> can be defined in several ways. One broad definition is:</p> <blockquote><p>A complex web of social processes that intensify and expand worldwide economic, cultural, political and technological exchanges and connections (Campbell, MacKinnon, &amp; Stevens, 2011, p. 4).</p></blockquote> <p>Globalization can also be simply described as the movement of goods, ideas, values, and people around the world. The term was first used in the early 1950s to recognize the increasing interdependence of economies and societies around the world. Globalization, however, has existed for centuries by way of evolving trade routes, including the slave trade, colonization, and immigration.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1778" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market.jpg" alt="Narrow boats filled with food, clothes, hats, and much more float in a canal alongside a market." width="500" height="753" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market.jpg 1360w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-199x300.jpg 199w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-680x1024.jpg 680w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-768x1157.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-1020x1536.jpg 1020w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-65x98.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-225x339.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Floating-Market-350x527.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.2 A floating market in Thailand.</div></div> <p>Today, we are divided into separate countries, each looking out for its own national self-interest, with all its flaws and benefits. At the same time, other entities such as multinational corporations cross borders, which leads to global economic and political integration. Many benefits can result from global integration and interdependence, but we also need to heed its negative effects.</p> <p>We can look at&nbsp;the relationship between globalization and tourism in several ways. For the purposes of this chapter,&nbsp;we will&nbsp;consider the impact of tourism and travel on&nbsp;globalization, and the impact of globalization on tourism.&nbsp;But first, let’s keep in mind why it is important for a local tour operator, general manager, or tourism business owner to think about globalization.&nbsp;More importantly, let’s consider where we should be looking to understand globalization and future trends. The rest of this chapter will&nbsp;address these topics.</p> <h1>The Impact of Globalization on&nbsp;Tourism</h1> <p>We can assess the impact of globalization on tourism from a number of perspectives. Here, we will discuss five&nbsp;examples: global mobility and ease of travel; population and demographic trends; terrorism, safety, and security; increased awareness of new destinations; and poverty.</p> <h2>Global Mobility and Ease of Travel</h2> <p>The advances made in transportation that have enabled global mobility are particularly significant. Modern aircraft, cruise ships, trains, and other modes of transport allow people to move quickly and relatively cheaply. Aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner have opened new routes by creating an aircraft capable of flying “long haul” distances with a smaller passenger load. Fast trains, road systems, and even city bike rental programs enable people to move, tour, and explore the world. These changes have allowed more people to travel more often in less time.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 2048px"><img class="wp-image-1779 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening.jpg" alt="Black-and-white panorama of people lined up along a runway, near several airplanes and a hangar." width="2048" height="396" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-300x58.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-1024x198.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-768x149.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-1536x297.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-65x13.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-225x44.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Official-Airport-Opening-350x68.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.3 The Vancouver International Airport’s official opening in 1931.</div></div> <p>Ease of travel has also helped to overcome the barriers of fear, frustration, and expense. For example, an international banking system allows access to money almost anywhere in the world. Multinational corporations, which provide flights, local transportation, and accommodation and food, have allowed for “one-stop shopping” for travel bookings. Mobile devices have also changed the nature of travel in terms of what travellers do and how they interact with a destination, making it easier to, for example, select a restaurant, navigate a big city, or translate a foreign language. As a result, there are fewer unexplored places in the world anymore.</p> <p>The ease of travel has also facilitated the rapid global transfer of viruses. While spread owing to global air travel has occurred in other outbreaks such as SARS in 2003, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 illustrates the new challenges faced by the air transportation system. The willingness for quick action to contain future viruses means that airlines will need to be ready, willing and able to terminate travel routes upon any notice of health concerns.</p> <h2>Population and Demographic Trends</h2> <p>According to the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (2019a), the world population reached 7.7 billion in 2019 and is projected to exceed 9.7 billion by 2050. The population continues to increase, but not uniformly across the world. The overall global population rate of increase is slowing but birth and death rates are vastly different between developed and developing nations (UNDESA, 2019b). For instance, among developed countries, there is a growing percentage of people over 65 that will reach 25% by 2050 (UNDESA 2019a). With a smaller percentage engaged in the workforce, there will be implications on social and health services. Globally, the people under the age of 24 will decline in every region of the world. Among developing countries, half the global growth between 2019 and 2050 will come from Sub-Saharan Africa. For instance, Nigeria will double its population to 4 million by 2050 (UNDESA 2019b). The two most populous countries, India and China will also experience different trajectories; India will surpass China as the most populous country in the world by 2027 (UNDESA 2019b).<del></del></p> <p>Other critical population trends affecting global development and tourism include the following (UNDESA 2019c; UNDESA 2019d):<del></del></p> <ul><li>By 2100, approximately 40% of the world’s total population is expected to be African. While birth rates are tending to fall around the world, they are still higher across Africa than in most other parts of the globe. This could result in a youth dividend or further exacerbate problems on the African continent.</li> <li>More people are migrating than ever before, with 272 million recent migrants in 2019 alone compared with about 175 million in 2000. The top five destinations are the United States, Germany, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, and the United Kingdom.</li> <li>Some 55% of the global population is urban, and the urbanization trend is expected to continue as people search for more jobs, more social and health services, and more activities. Not everyone benefits equally though, as housing and other infrastructure struggles to keep up with the growing urban population.</li> </ul> <p>To keep up with all of these changes in demographics, destinations will need to provide products and services to suit the older, culturally diverse, multi-generational travellers as well as the adventurous youth. Additionally, hiring and retaining staff will require a rethinking of human resource policies and procedures, compensation, and other aspects for the changing population of employees.<span style="background-color: #ffff00"><br /> </span></p> <h2>Terrorism, Safety, and Security</h2> <p>Terrorist attacks and political unrest globally have&nbsp;certainly disrupted tourism, but not halted it. The areas most affected, of course, are those where unrest has occurred and has been the focu<span style="background-color: #ffffff">s of extensive media attention. A g</span><span style="background-color: #00ff00"><span style="background-color: #ffffff">lobal terrorism index produced by the Institute of Economics and Peace (2019) shows that while fatalities from terrorism have declined since 2015, the number of affected countries, 71, is the highest since 2002. Of note is the rise in far-right terrorism in western countries, with an increase of 320% over the past five years (p. 4). </span></span></p> <p>The 2020 global pandemic for COVID-19 resulted in a massive and sudden transformation in the relationship between safety and travel. Starting in early March, 2020, the Canadian government moved toward closing the borders and curtailing outbound and inbound travel. These efforts were to, at first, contain the spread of the virus internationally, evolving toward a national quarantine to “flatten the curve” of number of people effected. Clearly, the pandemic has changed how we travel, and how we define safety of travel in a global setting.</p> <p>While safety and security may not be the driving reasons for tourists selecting a particular destination, certainly a lack of safety and security often eliminates a location from travellers’ “wish lists.” Safety and security for travellers is becoming more important as countries move to protect their citizens. Government agencies around the world produce advisories and warnings for their citizens to stay away from dangerous locations and political unrest.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Travel Advisories</strong></p> <p>Travel advisories serve as warning systems for people from specific countries to avoid particular destinations because of actual or potential threats to citizens. To learn more about advisories for specific countries, see the Canadian government web page at <a href="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories" data-url="http://travel.gc.ca/travelling/advisories">Canada’s Travel Advisories</a> and compare them to <a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au" data-url="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au">Australia’s Travel Advisories</a>, the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html" data-url="http://travel.state.gov/content/passports/english/alertswarnings.html">United States’ Travel Advisories</a>, and the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice" data-url="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">United Kingdom’s Travel Advisories</a>.</p> </div> <p>The focus on safety and security has had several impacts on&nbsp;travellers. Most notably, security at most airports has been increased in an effort to protect people and planes (Flight Global, 2015). Screening procedures can take longer and some items are no longer allowed on board. Other security requirements, such as showing passports and providing fingerprints, have been implemented for entry into some countries. While all acts of terrorism cannot be stopped, the tourism industry is attempting to provide as much safety and security as it can.</p> <h2>Increased Awareness of New Destinations</h2> <p>Another influence of globalization on tourism is a greater awareness of destinations and the range of leisure activities, sites, and cultures to visit around the world. Generating knowledge of a destination is obviously a key first step in marketing a destination, and this is achieved by way of travel shows, films, social media, and other forms of communication. The competition to attract visitors is fierce considering the sheer number of places available for travel; it can be easy to get lost in the noise of global competition.</p> <h2>Poverty</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1780" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around.jpg" alt="A small child with cloth wrapped around their head plays with debris in the street." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Small-kid-playing-around-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.4 This image of a child playing in the streets of Antigua, Guatemala, was captured by a visitor.</div></div> <p>Globalization has contributed to increased demand for goods and services and overall economic growth, with the result of global poverty having decreased over the years. However, at the same time, the gap between the richest and poorest has expanded. A significant portion of the world’s population is simply unable to participate in, or benefit from, tourism. The economic gains from a tourism economy in a developing country such as Honduras versus a developed country such as Canada is unequal. Simply put, not everyone has the same opportunities to profit. Environmental costs are also unevenly distributed in the world, with poor countries lacking the resources to adapt to impacts (such as droughts, increased disease, soil erosion), and shouldering the majority of the repercussions of phenomena such as global warming.</p> <p>Another way&nbsp;to analyze the interplay between&nbsp;tourism and globalization is to consider the reverse view:&nbsp;the impact of tourism on globalization.</p> <h1>Impact of Tourism on Globalization</h1> <p>In this section, we will look at tourism as a global force —&nbsp;for peace, for cultural homogenization, for commodifying cultures, and for&nbsp;shaping the way we see the world.</p> <h2>Tourism as a Force for Peace</h2> <p>In the 1980s, a popular hypothesis was that tourism supported global peace by allowing travellers to learn about other cultures and meet people from other nations, as well as offering benefits accrued from international business. Peace is an obvious requirement for tourism if the industry is to be robust and sustainable. However, to date, there is little empirical evidence to support the claim that tourism fosters peace, however attractive as the idea may be. However, there is a growing body of research on the relationship between tourism, social justice, and human security, both negative and positive. Clearly, the simple presence of tourism does not immediately equate to societal benefit. Careful planning and a focus on policies supporting community well-being and sustainability are required.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/" data-url="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</a> are important for tourism organizations to take into account. They help in guiding the evolution of tourism and travel toward a more positive and hopeful form of tourism as well as enabling a more sustainable, and peaceful, future.</p> <h2>Tourism as Cultural Homogenizer</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1781" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line.jpg" alt="People dressed in classic Disney character costumes perform for a crowd of children." width="500" height="333" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-1536x1025.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Patriotic-Kick-Line-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.5 A “Patriotic Kick Line” on a cruise from Alaska to Vancouver.</div></div> <p><span style="background-color: #ffffff">Nevertheless, tourism does offer the opportunity to teach people about how to respect other cultures. Whereas some</span> argue that globalization has a <span class="glossary-term">homogenizing</span> effect on cultures, as Western values are spread through music, fashion, film, and food, rendering one culture indistinguishable from the next. But tourism cannot be viewed as the only means of transmitting western values.</p> <p>Some beliefs and values, such as embracing equality, inclusion, and diversity, or the need to protect children from harm, should be shared around the world. In the context of tourism and travel, these values are significant. For instance, companies need to ensure that their human resource practices are consistent and fair throughout the world. Exploiting children for sex is illegal, punishable in both the country visited and the home country of the tourist; some airlines and hotels are actively involved in supporting the prohibition of child sex tourism. Travellers are expected not to deface heritage sites or take rare or endangered natural or cultural objects as souvenirs. Such regulations speak to the universality of certain values and beliefs, which we all are required to follow as global citizens.</p> <h2>Tourism as&nbsp;Commodifier</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-998" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau.jpg#fixme#fixme" alt="Dancers in grass skirts, board shorts, and leis perform on a stage." width="600" height="450" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau.jpg 1600w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-768x576.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-1536x1152.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/04/Dancers-of-Germaine’s-Luau-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.6 Dancers at Germaine’s Luau near Honolulu, Hawaii.</div></div> <p>Another possible influence of tourism on globalization is the process of <span class="glossary-term">cultural commodification</span>, which refers to the drive toward putting a monetary value on every aspect of culture, from buying a sculpture stolen from an ancient temple, to buying endangered objects such as ivory and coral, or buying a T-shirt that desecrates a symbol or object important to another culture. This trend results in the degradation or devaluing of cultural values and beliefs and was explored in <a class="internal" href="#part-indigenous-tourism" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/indigenous-tourism/">Chapter 12</a> on Indigenous tourism.</p> <p>As one of the world’s largest industries, tourism impacts local, regional, and global economies.&nbsp;Resorts dot coastlines around the world and offer a welcome respite from colder climates to anyone wishing to experience a tropical beach, as well as the local culture and nature.&nbsp;While benefit comes to the community in the form of jobs, more often than not the larger share of the wealth leaks offshore. In response, local entrepreneurs and aid organizations have helped with initiatives that embrace local ownership in order for the wealth generated from tourism to stay <span class="glossary-term">in country</span>.&nbsp;Community-based tourism, responsible tourism, and social entrepreneurship all aim to bring greater benefit to local communities.</p> <h2>Tourism&nbsp;As a World View</h2> <p>Tourism is also a major influence in how we see and understand the world. Keith Hollinshead (2019) refers to it as <span class="glossary-term">tourism world-making</span>, or the way in which a place or culture is marketed and/or presented to tourists. Unlike local people, travellers experience a place for a few days, with limited knowledge of the culture and local way of life.&nbsp;Some visitors rely on available tourist information to make the most of the experience and to see the highlights. Others turn away and attempt to “go local” in search of the authentic experience with the belief that they can truly understand a place by avoiding the tourist sites.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1782" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1782" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp.jpg" alt="An elephant lies in a stream while a person washes his body with a brush." width="500" height="332" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-300x199.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-1024x680.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-768x510.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-1536x1020.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-225x149.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Maesa-Elephant-Camp-350x232.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.7 An elephant is washed at Maesa Elephant Camp in Thailand in preparation for a show for visitors.</div></div> <p>If tourists stay in their resort in a given country, their only interaction with a local culture may be the staff at the hotel. In many cases, visitors experience a place in a fragmented, disconnected way, seeing only a portion of a place. How much can be gained from such short and transient experiences? This debate leads to one of the often discussed, if not hotly debated, topics in tourism, that of <span class="glossary-term">authenticity of experience</span>. In 1976,&nbsp;Dean MacCannell released his book&nbsp;<em>The Tourist: A New Theory of the Leisure Class</em>, in which he argued that even those events that seem to be authentic are in some way staged for the visitor.<del><span style="background-color: #00ff00"><br /> </span></del></p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Cannibal Tours</strong></p> <p>In 1988, Dean O’Rourke shot a documentary profiling the experiences of jet-set travellers as they encountered locals in Papua New Guinea. The movie highlights the challenges that happen when visitors meet with “the other,” in that their expectations shape the behaviours of the locals. The movie features interviews with the locals as well as tourists. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUQ_8wl93HM" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUQ_8wl93HM">Watch the movie <em>Cannibal Tours</em></a>.</p> </div> <p>As a quick review before leaving here, drag the following factors to the correct description between globalization and tourism.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This section revisits some of those trends and explores some additional ones.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Trends Reports</strong></p> <p>In the tourism and hospitality industry, and in global business, many minds work to decipher industry trends in order to keep&nbsp;informed and make smart decisions.&nbsp;One example is the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2019" data-url="https://www.weforum.org/reports/global-competitiveness-report-2019"><em>Global Competitiveness Report 2019</em></a>, a product of the World Economic Forum.</p> <p>Focused strictly on tourism and hospitality, the&nbsp;UNWTO produces a <a href="https://www.unwto.org/barometer" data-url="https://www.unwto.org/barometer">World Tourism Barometer</a> that is updated regularly, available on a subscription basis.</p> </div> <p>First, let’s take a closer look at the difference between <span class="glossary-term">trends</span> and <span class="glossary-term">fads</span>. While trends and fads may look the same initially, fads will almost always have a definite start and end; they are finite. Examples include tornado tourism (storm chasing tours) and terminal tourism (where people visit airport terminals without flying out from them), which appear destined to disappear as quickly as they appeared.</p> <p>In contrast, trends influence things for long periods of time, potentially shifting the focus or direction of industry and society in a completely different direction. For example, the growing awareness of tourism impacts seems to be a long-term trend, leading to greater focus on developing sustainable experiences, products, and services for the mindful traveller. With hindsight, we can identify the trends versus the fads. Predicting the future, however, is not as&nbsp;easy.</p> <p>A useful tool to use in the analysis of global trends is the <span class="glossary-term">PESTLE</span> model, an acronym for political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental forces that affect the people, organization, or destination under study. It is important to note though, that the lines around these categories are somewhat fluid, and many factors will have implications on several areas. Now let’s delve into PESTLE in more detail.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Analysis Tools&nbsp;</strong></p> <p>The more complicated the world gets, the more it’s imperative that business leaders and decision-makers employ a framework for analyzing trends. While this chapter uses a PESTLE approach, other acronyms include PEST (omitting the legal and environmental reviews), or PEEST (omitting the legal reviews).

The world is currently challenged by growing populist movements, power conflicts and protectionist measures (Ipsos, 2020). Within this climate however, support for globalization is increasing, public services are improving (generally), and living standards are rising. The complexity of the political landscape is intensifying, making it that much more important for industry players to carefully monitor global conditions.</p> <p>Let’s have a look at political trends around the world and explore their implications on the tourism and hospitality industry.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1789" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1785" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2020/09/UNWTO-Secretary-General-visit-to-Greece.jpg" alt="A group poses in front of ancient Greek ruins covered in scaffolding.

Traditional Western destinations are under pressure to formulate policies, and create strategies and spending patterns that will enable them to compete with emerging destinations. Often, these national policies are impacted or governed by formal international agreements, affecting everything from the movement of people (visas and passports) to the flow of goods and services. International organizations such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), European Union (EU), Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) influence how the tourism and hospitality industry operates around the world.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: International Economic Groups</strong></p> <p>On the international stage, several groups are responsible for developing and setting policy that has an impact on tourism and hospitality development. Two examples are:</p> <p>The&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)</span> has 31 member countries that gather to discuss a range of policy issues, with&nbsp;a special committee dedicated to tourism. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/cfe/tourism/" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.oecd.org/cfe/tourism/">OECD’s tourism web page</a>.</p> <p>The <span class="glossary-term">Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)</span> forum also has a Tourism Working Group that recognizes the importance of sustainable tourism development for countries in the Asia Pacific Rim region. For more information, visit <a href="http://www.apec.org/Groups/SOM-Steering-Committee-on-Economic-and-Technical-Cooperation/Working-Groups/Tourism.aspx" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.apec.org/Groups/SOM-Steering-Committee-on-Economic-and-Technical-Cooperation/Working-Groups/Tourism.aspx">APEC’s tourism web page</a>.</p> </div> <p>Each country is responsible for creating and funding its own organizations responsible for tourism development at the federal, state/provincial, and local level. In the United States, for example, the National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO) is responsible for actively participating in domestic and international policy creation. One such policy is a memorandum of understanding with China regarding leisure group travel. The NTTO is engaged in international tourism discussions with organizations such as the OECD and APEC (see Spotlight On above), and has a representative at UNWTO (NTTO, n.d).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: The International Civil Aviation Organization </strong></p> <p>Many aspects of the tourism and hospitality industry are governed by international agreements and policies. The <span class="glossary-term">International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)</span> was created in 1944 with the signing of the Chicago Convention as a specialized agency of the United Nations. It works with 193 member countries and industry groups to help develop aviation policies and build capacity in countries with underdeveloped air industries. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx" target="_self" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://www.icao.int/Pages/default.aspx">International Civil Aviation Organization website</a>.</p> </div> <p>While from a policy perspective, countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Mexico and the United Kingdom have embraced tourism growth through a planned approach, tourism policy in Canada has often struggled in comparison to the attention given to other sectors such as oil and gas, forestry, fishing, and agriculture.</p> <p>A number of organizations, including the Conference Board of Canada and the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, have made recommendations for strong government policy support that could help the industry. Two key policy reforms suggested include (TIAC, 2019):</p> <ol><li>Increase base funding for Destination Canada (Canada’s national tourism organization), with performance-based annual increases to improve global competitiveness</li> <li>Streamline the travel visa issuance process, improve the Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA) program, monitor visa processing times, and continue to pursue visa-related partnerships with other countries to make it faster and easier for visitors to visit Canada</li> </ol> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: Canada’s Tourism Vision</strong></p> <p>The Canadian government, pre-COVID pandemic, introduced their plan for tourism in Canada. Recognizing the value the tourism and hospitality industry brings to the Canadian economy, the government outlined key targets and pillars for growth. Focused on making Canada a Top Ten most visited destination (again) by 2025, they committed to increased Marketing, improving Access, and building new Products — their “MAP to growth.” To explore more, visit <a href="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/134.nsf/eng/home" data-url="https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/134.nsf/eng/home">Tourism in Canada</a>.</p> </div> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Spotlight On: The Rise of Populist Nationalism</strong></p> <p>In 2016, the world experienced two major political acts that shook the international order. The British vote to leave the European Union and the election of Donald Trump in the United States were not the cause of populist nationalism. However, they were two very visible indicators about the extent of its rise around the world. It seemed that the global consensus that globalization was a positive force for international cooperation was being replaced by an emphasis on national sovereignty. Tribalism is winning hearts and minds. This increase in barriers to trade and cross-border movement has implications for many aspects of the tourism and hospitality industry (CreditSuisse, 2018, Ipsos, 2020).</p> </div> <p>The trend here may be the ongoing need to convince and lobby governments at all levels about the potential of tourism and the value of strategic planning and investment in tourism. It is perhaps not surprising that the tourism and hospitality sector, with such diverse organizations involved, struggles to find a single voice at times. This leads to a cycle where the sector rallies around initiatives such as Expo 86 and the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games, and then experiences a period of fragmentation. The post–COVID-19 pandemic world will require similar cooperation for the industry to renew itself.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789" style="width: 350px"><img class="wp-image-1786" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid.jpg" alt="A sign posted on a window reads, &amp;quot;I'm backing the bid. 2010 Vancouver.&amp;quot;" width="350" height="467" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid-768x1024.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid-1152x1536.jpg 1152w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Backing-the-Bid-350x467.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.9 B.C. businesses, including this pub, rallied around the bid to bring the 2010 Winter Olympic Games to Vancouver.</div></div> <h1>Economic Trends</h1> <p>Like most other industrial sectors, tourism is affected by global economic trends. Tourism was initially negatively impacted after the global financial crisis of 2007–2008, with international tourism arrivals dropping globally from 950 million down to just under 912 million (Papatheodorou, Rossello, &amp; Xiao, 2010). However, the industry was quick to rebound, with the number of travellers increasing by 2010, surpassing the 1 billion mark in 2012 and 1.4 billion by 2018 (World Bank, 2020), prior to the COVID pandemic and near collapse of the global tourism industry.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789" style="width: 600px"><img class="wp-image-1787" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call.jpg" alt="A huge crowd in a lobby-like area with a high ceiling." width="600" height="400" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call.jpg 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-1024x683.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-768x512.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Last-Call-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.10 A crowd gathers at a former airport that now acts as a historical site.</div></div> <p>Economic uncertainties for the tourism industry have persisted, however, leading many industry insiders to monitor&nbsp;several economic&nbsp;trends, including collaborative consumption, shifts in emerging economies, and conscious consumerism.</p> <h2>Collaborative Consumption</h2> <p>Although the phenomenon of <span class="glossary-term">collaborative consumption (CC)</span>, also known as the sharing economy, began before the global financial crisis, it gained strength as a result of it. CC is a blend of economy, technology, and a social movement where access to goods and skills is more important than ownership (Sacks, 2011). Research has shown that CC is motivated by a variety of factors including sustainability, enjoyment of the activity, and economic benefits (Hamari, Sjöklint, and Ukkonen, 2016).</p> <p>Airbnb was one of the first, and arguably most well-known example of the tourism sharing marketplace, but several other companies have joined it, including Zipcar, Uber, and Couchsurfing. According to Nielsen (2014a), more than two-thirds of global respondents to a poll are interested in joining this revolution. A gap may exist though between attitudes and behaviours surrounding CC – people may perceive it positively, but then do not follow through with purchasing (Hamari, Sjöklint, and Ukkonen, 2016). The impacts on the tourism industry are still to be determined, although the World Economic Forum outlined four main trends affecting this movement (2019b). They note that: (1) growth is likely to be uneven – mindsets and trust in the CC systems take time; (2) demographics will drive the adoption – CC enables people to access things that might not normally be able to afford; (3) regulators are taking notice – more policies and regulations are being enacted to manage CC; and (4) “sharewashing” is occurring – not all CC is built on the original underlying philosophy. CC is one trend that is likely to persist for some time into the future.</p> <h2>Emerging Economies</h2> <p>In 2001, a new acronym was introduced into the economic world —&nbsp;<span class="glossary-term">BRIC</span>. This refers to the growing economies of Brazil, Russia, India, and China (Northam, 2014). These turbo-charged emerging economies were growing fast and looking to be the new powerhouses in global economic circles, even forming political and economic alliances. South Africa joined the group in 2010 and they became known as the <span class="glossary-term">BRICS</span> (da Silva, 2020), although in some definitions they were replaced by South Korea in 2018 (International Monetary Fund, 2019).</p> <p>With this growth came travellers looking for new destinations to visit. Outbound tourism development from China has been especially energetic, with numbers increasing from 58 million in 2010 to over 160 million in 2018 (Statista, 2020). But all has not gone well for these emerging economies and only China has maintained the pace of expansion. Other countries have joined the race, creating new terms such as <span class="glossary-term">MINT</span> (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Turkey) and <span class="glossary-term">Next Eleven</span> (Bangladesh, Egypt, Indonesia, Iran, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Philippines, South Korea, Turkey, and Vietnam). Time will tell where new tourism growth and opportunities arise in the frenetic global economy, and who will be the next powerhouse to watch.</p> <h2>Conscious Consumerism</h2> <p><span class="glossary-term">Conscious consumerism</span>, or socially conscious consumer behaviour, is another economic trend with implications for the tourism industry. This term refers to consumers who are using their purchasing power to shape the world according to their values and beliefs, leading organizations to project a more ethical or responsible image (Government of Canada, 2012). Conscious consumers look for positive outcomes with what they buy and/or seek ways to minimize or eliminate the negative effects of consumerism.</p> <p>This socially and environmentally-responsible purchasing by many consumers can direct travellers to more sustainable services and products, or even a “de-growing” of tourism (Higgins-Desbiolles, 2018). Destinations and businesses interested in pursuing this market need to be acutely aware of social and environmental issues, potentially ranging from organic produce and animal welfare to human rights (Shaw, Grehan, Shiu, Hassan, &amp; Thomson, 2005). Veganism, the complete abstaining of the use of animal products, or vegetarianism, the abstinence of consuming meat products have experienced growth in part due to conscious consumer choices regarding health and the environmental impacts of industrial meat production. Some of the key principles for consideration by the tourism industry include an assumption that the traditional industrial model is not working and needs to be replaced, that awareness of the issues require a different mindset, and that change will come from the grassroots rather than from above (Pollack, 2012). This is a shift that has profitability and culture change firmly in its sights (Nielsen, 2014b).</p> <h1>Social and Cultural Trends</h1> <p>Defining culture as “a way of life” brings us to consider the implications of globalization as a defining influence in how we live and, therefore, who we are as individuals. Some argue that globalization has created a culture crisis, with values, beliefs and identity all made secondary to economic interests and the pervasive and ever-growing nature of technology in our lives. Some key socio-cultural trends to consider include using travel to socially bond, dynamic populations and migration, growing global inequality, and the consumption of experiences.</p> <h2>Travel as a Time to Bond</h2> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789" style="width: 700px"><img class="wp-image-1788" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky.jpg" alt="A large group of people wearing light blue shirts, athletic shorts, and lanyards." width="700" height="320" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky-300x137.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky-768x351.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky-65x30.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky-225x103.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Team-BC-first-at-Western-Canada-Summer-Games-by-Kevin-Dubinsky-350x160.jpg 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 14.11 Athletes from Team BC at the 2011 Western Canada Summer Games in Kamloops.</div></div> <p>Visiting&nbsp;friends and relatives, known in the industry simply as <span class="glossary-term">VFR</span>, is a common and important subset of tourism demand worldwide. With their busy lives, people are seeking&nbsp;a moment, place, and activity to share with family or friends. In addition to the growing VFR trend is the increasing popularity of group travel, as exemplified in the sports tourism sector (see <a class="internal" href="#part-entertainment" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/entertainment/">Chapter 6</a> on entertainment)&nbsp;with sports clubs and&nbsp;teams&nbsp;who travel together, and associations that bring together people with shared interests in cuisine, walking, birdwatching, or other avocations.</p> <h2>Dynamic Populations and Global Migration</h2> <p>Certainly a trend in globalization is the significant movement of people around the world and changes in their characteristics. The population of British Columbia, as of January 1, 2020, was estimated at 5.1 million, with immigrants (64,441) representing the main source of population growth in 2019, along with 9,551 people from other provinces (Government of BC, 2020). According to Canada’s 2016 census, just over 30% of BC’s population are a visible minority with the largest groups being Chinese (11.2%), South Asian (8.0%), Filipino (3.2%), and Korean (1.3%) (Statistics Canada, 2017).</p> <p>Western populations are continuing to age as reproduction levels are tending to be below replacement levels (Ipsos, 2020). While countries are adjusting between young and old, rich and poor, tipping points are being experienced, resulting in social pressures on services and systems. Employment patterns are shifting as the working masses also age, creating gaps and opportunities in work forces.</p> <p>Additionally, population growth around the world is not occurring uniformly. “More than half of the projected global rise up to 2050 will be in just nine countries,” according to Ipsos (2020, p. 11). As the number of people increase in certain regions of the world, many pursue opportunities in other locations. Conflict, climate change, economic challenges, persecution and other factors also result in refugees seeking safe havens.</p> <p>These demographic and population shifts are expected to result in dramatic changes to the social and economic landscape. Some of these changes are generating earlier noted trends such as the rise in populism and protectionist policies. Implications for the tourism industry include a growing need to address the challenges of a multicultural workforce, including preconceptions related to customer service and management, and retaining or hiring older employees. It’s important for diverse teams to be able to work well together and to communicate well with visitors and guests.</p> <h2>Growing Inequality and Some Opportunities</h2> <p>Global prosperity is increasing. However, behind the improvements (generally) in living, housing and food, division between the wealthy and the poor is increasing (Ipsos, 2020). Growing numbers of younger generations are perceiving that they will be worse off than their parents at similar ages (Ipsos, 2020). Wealth is being concentrated in the hands of the few, resulting in population unrest.</p> <p>At the same time, opportunities are coming available. More liberal policies are providing opportunities for women and the education gap is slowly shrinking between men and women (Ipsos, 2020). Women remain generally disadvantaged, especially in developing countries, but there have been significant improvements. More needs to be done though, to eliminate disparities.</p> <h2>Consuming Experiences</h2> <p>During the late 1990s, Joseph Pine and James Gilmore introduced the concept of the Experience Economy (Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1998). They suggest that economies have progressed beyond commodities (raw material), goods, and services. Instead, people seek a higher level of engagement and stimulation from their purchases. These economic offerings are internalized, creating intensely personal events, which only exist in the minds of the consumers (Pine &amp; Gilmore, 1998). A focus on experiences allow the supplier to be more memorable and often charge a premium. While this shift has been occurring for some time, the full implications are still being explored and felt in the tourism and hospitality industry.</p> <h1>Technology Trends</h1> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1789" style="width: 500px"><img class="wp-image-1789" src="https://opentextbc.ca/introtourism2e/wp-content/uploads/sites/315/2021/06/Arlene-Foster-Launches-New-Tourism-Apps.jpg" alt="Two women sitting in front of an old castle.

Three key technology trends affecting tourism and hospitality today and into the foreseeable future are&nbsp;mobile technology, smart tourism, and immersive technology.</p> <h2>Mobile Technology</h2> <p>Mobile technology and wireless connections affect many aspects of the tourism industry on a global scale. Since the release of the iPhone in 2007, consumers have become more and more reliant on their “hand-held computers” to provide information about the world around them (Kim &amp; Kim, 2017). Mobile technology allows people increased freedom to negotiate their day-to-day lives remotely while staying connected (Dickinson, Ghali, Cherrett, Speed, Davies, &amp; Norgate, 2014). Online user-generated content, whether through social media (e.g., Facebook, Snapchat) or travel-rating sites (e.g., TripAdvisor, Zagat), is shaping where people go, where they stay and eat, and the types of activities they engage in. Mobile technology can also be used to better understand the impacts, positive and negative, that tourism and hospitality are having on destinations (Kim &amp; Kim, 2017).</p> <p>Smartphones and applications (or apps) provide access to information and the ability for tourists to shape their travel en route, affecting tourism travel decisions and behaviours in a more fluid way than ever before (Chung &amp; Koo, 2015). Travellers can book hotels instantly, searching for the best deals available. Mobile apps are replacing the hotel concierge by providing up-to-date information, along with maps and directions, for many of the desired activities at destinations. Rating sites guide travellers towards recommended attractions and away from others (Mehraliyev, Choi &amp; King, 2020).</p> <p>Wireless technology has also given rise to location-based advertising, allowing product or service providers to market themselves when travellers are in the general area (Hopken, Fuchs, Zanker, &amp; Beer, 2010). Attraction alerts and special offers, often triggered by applications, provoke the user’s attention to elicit an immediate response. These “geo-fenced” advertisements can be more effective in encouraging same-day and even delayed purchases than “non-geo-fenced” marketing, especially with impulse products and services (Fang, Gu, Luo &amp; Xu, 2015).</p> <p>Free internet access has become a standard requirement for accommodations, ranking it ahead of privacy, swimming pools, beaches, restaurants and fitness centres (Bachman, 2016). The&nbsp;importance of mobile technology and applications is expected to increase as travellers become more independent and less reliant on packaged options (Buhalis &amp; Law, 2008). Proponents of technology suggest that traditional ways of providing tourism and hospitality information will disappear as mobile technology becomes even more prevalent (Dickinson et al., 2014).</p> <h2>Smart Tourism</h2> <p>Tourism destinations and organizations are now interacting with data on a real-time basis, better understanding how tourists are interacting with their locations. Smart tourism describes the increasing dependence by destinations, industry and tourists on technology, and is an important element of smart cities (Tripathy, Tripathy, Ray &amp; Mohanty, 2018). In particular, large quantities of data are gathered to better understand how destinations and services are consumed, and then turned into value propositions (experiences) (Gretzel, Sigala, Xiang &amp; Koo, 2015). In a hyper-connected world, technology allows for the gathering and transmission of data through a variety of means (e.g. RFID, NFC, 5G, Internet of Things). The ever-present mobile technology (discussed above) that tourists are increasingly relying on also collects and exchanges a range of information about the users including locations, activities, search terms, purchases and interests. In turn and aided in some cases by artificial intelligence (AI), this “big data” is processed and analyzed to model, optimize and visualize the use of the destinations, and increase the engagement of locals and visitors with the location (Tripathy, Tripathy, Ray &amp; Mohanty, 2018). Smart cities strive to apply this information and improve a variety of destination aspects such as resource use, governance, sustainability and quality of life (Gretzel, Sigala, Xiang &amp; Koo, 2015). As technology advances and interconnectivity increases, even more data will become available.</p> <h2>Immersive Technology</h2> <p>The rapid advance of technology is providing electronic immersive experiences through such things as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR), with the potential to change how people travel (Loureiro, Guerreiro, &amp; Ali, 2020). While these two technologies are very different in the feelings provider to the user, they can provide technology-enhanced views of destinations, products and services. VR provides a more immersive and stimulating perspective of reality through stereoscopic head-mounted displays, headphones and controllers. AR adds virtual elements to the world, allowing the viewer to interact with both the real and imagined objects through see-through displays (García-Crespo, González-Carrasco, López-Cuadrado, Villanueva, González, 2016). Both AR and VR can be used in a variety of means before, during and after a visit, for activities such as marketing, education and entertainment. The tourism and hospitality industry is still discovering the range of possibilities for these technologies.</p> <h1>Legal Trends</h1> <p>The legal element of a PESTLE analysis considers the impacts of the legal and regulatory climate, and whether they help or hinder the organization. The legal environment can determine what can and cannot be done, and establishes the rules by which the tourism and hospitality industry must operate in. However, these rules are not stagnant or uniform around the world, so producers and consumers must remain current with rules and regulations in the locations they do business. Two legal trends are discussed below – an increased focus on privacy and security, and the impacts of technology.</p> <h2>Privacy and Security</h2> <p>Data breaches have become too common as systems become more interconnected and more information goes online. People have become reliant on their mobile devices (discussed above), creating more opportunities for data to be left unprotected or stolen for malicious intent (Swinhoe, 2020). In the past 20 years, billions of user accounts have been exposed or hacked, including approximately 500 million from Marriott International, 538 million from Sina Weibo (China’s equivalent to Twitter), 3 billion from Yahoo, and 165 million from LinkedIn (Swinhoe, 2020). With all of these data breaches, organizations have been put under increasing pressure to provide adequate protection to their data systems. As well, liability insurance is becoming more common as a means to protect organizations from the financial implications of a data loss (Brooks, 2020).</p> <h2>Technology and the Legal Landscape</h2> <p>Similar to many other industries, the legal environment is being impacted by and impacting technology. Advances in technology are automating certain aspects of the legal system, turning it into a commodity, which lowers the price and increases access to more users. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) and predictive algorithms are improving legal processes and providing efficiencies (Brooks, 2020). These emerging technologies are having a positive impact on the legal industry by opening opportunities and expanding territories. Law offices can now provide services to more distant clients, increasing competition, and decreasing costs for users.</p> <p>The legal world is also working hard to keep up with changes in technology, as innovation moves faster than new regulations. For example, rules around drones and autonomous vehicles continue to adapt to new uses and capabilities (LexisNexis 2020). Meanwhile, cannabis laws are also changing as locations adopt different perspectives on its development and use. Climate change may also create new legal challenges in the coming years.</p> <h1>Environmental Trends</h1> <p>In 2018, a young Swedish activist, Greta Thunberg, became one of the most visible figures in the fight against climate change. Her protest, Fridays for Future (FFF), have inspired students around the world to boycott school on Fridays to promote the 2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Her actions and the subsequent growing support have moved organizations and nations to re-evaluate society’s consumption patterns and their impacts on the world (Nevett, 2019). One obvious impact on the tourism and hospitality industry of this movement is “flight shaming” or discouraging people from using planes due to their carbon footprint.</p> <p>Climate change is a serious challenge facing the world. The United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), created in 1988, has produced irrefutable evidence that climate change is human-made. We are already witnessing significant shifts in weather patterns, and climatic events such as tornadoes, drought, and flooding are occurring with greater frequency and impact. Yet dependence on a global economy fuelled by population growth and ever-increasing demand for consumer goods has led to significant debate as to how to respond to climate change, although action is clearly required.</p> <h2>Impacts from and on the Environment</h2> <p>From a tourism and travel perspective, we have seen examples throughout the chapters of this textbook of how climate change is impacting tourism and how tourism is impacting climate change. In the transportation sector, drastic temperature changes from sudden ice thaws to heatwave conditions affect highways and runways, landslides close road systems, and rising sea levels threaten infrastructure such as airports and cruise ship wharves. In the accommodations sector, coastal storms impact resorts, summer water shortages put pressure on resort communities, and unpredictable snowfalls close ski resorts. Food and beverage operators are facing increased food costs as drought conditions make growing certain crops more and more expensive. In the recreation and entertainment sector, both natural and built attractions are threatened by unpredictable weather patterns. And travel services providers struggle to stay abreast of the effects of superstorms and polar vortexes. <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a> explored some of the impacts that the tourism and hospitality industry have on the environment and climate, as well as some of the mitigation tactics for reducing those impacts (e.g. carbon offsetting, responsible consumption).</p> <p>So what can we do? World-renowned scientist Jane Goodall provides a suggestion, “Each and every one of us of us must do our part in creating a better world, for though the small choices we make each day — what we buy, what we eat, what we wear — may seem insignificant, the cumulative effect of billions of people making ethical choices, will start to heal the natural world” (Gonzalez, 2019).</p> <h2>UN Sustainable Development Goals</h2> <p>The United Nations (UN) approved the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development on September 25, 2015 (Tourism for SDGS, 2020). This agreement contained the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with 17 goals and 169 targets to be achieved by 2030. These goals are interconnected, ambitious, and cover a wide variety of global issues including the eradication of poverty (Goal #1), quality education for all (#4), gender equality (#5), sustainable cities and communities (#11), and climate action (#13). The SDGs were developed as a global partnership to improve life in a sustainable way for the future. The tourism and hospitality industry has recognized its role in helping to achieve the UNSDGs, and in particular, have targeted goals 8, 12 and 14 (decent work and economic growth, responsible consumption and production, and the sustainable use of oceans and marine resources respectively).</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><strong>Take a Closer Look: The United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)<br /> </strong></p> <p>According the UN these goals are a universal call to action that will ultimately protect the planet putting an end to poverty and bringing about a more peaceful and prosperous world.

Shifting products and services to meet the needs and desires of these new visitors will require flexibility and creativity for BC’s tourism industry in the future.</p> <p>BC has also been impacted by the increase in new destinations, fighting for share of the growing tourism economy. Social media and other recent innovations in communication will continue to grow in importance for BC to generate awareness of its many tourism products and services. BC’s many unique cultures and experiences will help keep the province competitive as long as the industry also recognizes the potential negative impacts that tourism can have.</p> <p>Recognition of tourism’s importance in BC’s economy, along with supportive legislation and funding, is key to the long-term survival of the industry. At the same time, steps must be taken to prepare for the effects of climate change, with potentially shorter winters and reductions in precipitation. BC’s tourism industry is already feeling the effects of collaborative consumption as services such as Airbnb grow in popularity in the province. The spread of technological advances and improved wireless access will help the industry satisfy this aspect of the market, while also increasing the means to raise awareness with more potential visitors.</p> <p>To take advantage of these global opportunities, British Columbia’s tourism industry&nbsp;will have to react quickly to existing and emerging trends. In the meantime, we hope this textbook will serve as foundation for&nbsp;emerging tourism and hospitality professionals as they continue to learn about the industry.</p> <p>What are some of the possible benefits and drawbacks of globalization on tourism?</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

For instance, a tour that culminates at the Quneitra Viewpoint allows visitors to watch battles of the Syrian civil war in real time. Tour leaders include a retired Israel Defense Forces colonel who shared that tourists to the area “feel that they are a part of it. They can go home and tell their friends, ‘I was on the border and I saw a battle'” (Kamin, 2014, para. 2). Other tours travel to the Israeli border town of Sderot, an area on the Gaza Strip under heavy rocket fire.</p> <p>According to Philip Stone, director of the Institute for Dark Tourism Research at the U.K.’s University of Central Lancashire, while war tourism is not a new phenomenon, the increased commercialization has marked a new trend. Dark tourism now has a more sophisticated infrastructure than the days when Thomas Cook took visitors to see hangings, and the increase in technology and interpersonal communications has caused this area of tourism to grow at a faster rate (Kamin, 2014).</p> <p>The article cites media phenomena such as VICE videos (online documentaries) and celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain’s show <em>Parts Unknown</em>, as well as the growth of the adventure tourism industry, as contributing factors. They list hyper-extreme tour operators such as War Zone Tours and Wild Frontiers (both in operation since the 1990s) as pioneers of the sector. More recent examples include former journalist Nicholas Wood, who formed Political Tours, a company that takes around a year to plan small-group excursions to political hot spots such as Libya, to the tune of $7,000 per guest (Kamin, 2014).</p> <p>In addition to group tours, FIT (fully independent travellers) are creating their own extreme experiences, such as joining protestors in Kiev’s Independence Square and visiting Tahrir Square in Egypt to witness the election of Mohammed Morsi (Kamin, 2014).</p> <p>Travel to North Korea is also a growing market, doubling in size each year with between 6,000 and 7,000 people making the trip in 2013. Some travellers cite their visits to countries and areas such as these with motivating them toward becoming journalists and activists. Others state their experiences are therapeutic, helping them to understand their own difficult experiences or those of others, such as the military service of family members (Kamin, 2014). According to one of these tourists, “You go to the most extreme place in order to not be alone with your feelings. You really can’t be anywhere else but there” (Kamin, 2014, para. 25).</p> <p>Refer to the <a href="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/groups/institute_for_dark_tourism_research.php" data-url="https://www.uclan.ac.uk/research/explore/groups/institute_for_dark_tourism_research.php">Institute for Dark Tourism Research</a> and answer the following questions:</p> <ol><li>Would you classify this type of travel as a trend,&nbsp;or a fad?</li> <li>The article seems to imply that dark tourism is an extension of adventure tourism. Do you agree? Why or why not?</li> <li>How does the concept of authenticity of experience factor into dark tourism?</li> <li>Imagine you are a citizen in a part of the world that is experiencing hardship and this type of tourism is increasing in your community. How might you feel about it?</li> <li>Imagine you go to a famous battlefield where Canadians had fought and died, such as Vimy Ridge the World War I battlefield in France.&nbsp;What are the visitor motivations and what is the outcome of the visitor experience?</li> <li>Would you classify visits to Ground Zero in New York as dark tourism? Why or why not?</li> <li>What are the implications for tourism operators in these areas in terms of risk management and legal liability?</li> </ol> </div> </div> <h1>References</h1> <p class="hanging-indent">Bachman, J.

Communities across Canada developed their own marketing strategies as transportation development took hold. For instance, the town of Maisonneuve in Quebec launched a campaign from 1907 to 1915 calling itself “Le Pittsburg du Canada.” By 1935, Quebec was spending $250,000 promoting tourism. Other provinces such as Ontario, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia followed suit, also enjoying the benefits of establishing provincial tourism bureaus (Dawson, 2004).</li> <li><strong>1911:</strong> The Dominion Parks Branch is created.<br /> The Dominion Forest Reserves and Parks Act created the Dominion Parks Branch, the first of its kind in the world (Shoalts, 2011).</li> <li><strong>1914-1960:</strong> The Railway Age.<br /> By the onset of World War I in 1914, four railways dominated the Canadian landscape:Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR), Canadian Northern Railway (CNOR), the Grand Trunk Railway (GTR), and the Grand Trunk Pacific (GTP). Unfortunately, their rapid expansion soon brought the last three into near bankruptcy (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.). In 1923, these three rail companies were amalgamated into the Canadian National Railway (CNR), and together with the CPR, these trans-continentals dominated the Canadian travel landscape until other forms of transportation became more popular.</li> <li><strong>1937:</strong> Air Canada was formed.<br /> Our national airline, Air Canada, was formed in as Trans-Canada Air Lines.</li> <li><strong>1950-1960:</strong> Increased mass travel.<br /> Through the 1950s and 1960s, reduced airfares saw increased mass travel.&nbsp;Competitors including Canadian Pacific (which became Canadian Airlines in 1987) began to launch international flights during this time to Australia, Japan, and South America (<em>Canadian Geographic, </em>2000).</li> <li><strong>1962:</strong> Trans-Canada Highway officially opens.<br /> It would take decades before a coast-to-coast highway was created, with the Trans-Canada Highway officially opening in Revelstoke in 1962. When it was fully completed in 1970, it was the longest national highway in the world, spanning one-fifth of the globe (MacEachern, 2012).</li> <li><strong>1970:</strong> The National Park System Plan divided Canada into 39 regions.</li> <li><strong>1978:</strong> The popularity of car travel was partially to blame for the decline in rail travel.<br /> In 1978, with declining interest in rail travel, the CPR and CNR were forced to combine their passenger services to form VIA Rail (Library and Archives Canada, n.d.).The rising popularity of car travel was partially to blame for the decline in rail travel, although it took time to develop.</li> <li><strong>1987:</strong> Canada’s first marine conservation areas created.</li> <li><strong>2000-2002:</strong> Air Canada was facing financial peril and forced to restructure.<br /> A numbered company, owned in part by Air Canada, purchased 82% of Canadian Airline’s shares, with the result of Air Canada becoming the country’s only national airline (<em>Canadian Geographic, </em>2000).&nbsp;The 2000s saw Air Canada experiencing a roller-coaster performance from verging near bankruptcy in 2002</li> <li><strong>2013-2017:</strong> Air Canada transforms.<br /> Air Canada experienced a number of transformations from interior and interior aircraft redesigns and further fleet upgrades</li> <li><strong>2019:</strong> Air Canada takes over Air Tansat.<br /> Once a rival airline, Air Transat was subsequently taken over by Air Canada.</li> <li><strong>2020 (March):</strong> COVID causes an almost complete shut down.<br /> Tourism was placed in a standstill as global travel restrictions were imposed to prevent the spread of infection. Aggravated with a nose dive of consumer confidence in travel, many tourism businesses and operators big and small were forced to close.</li> </ul> </div></div>

<div class="back-matter miscellaneous" id="back-matter-slug-2nd-edition-changes" title="2nd Edition Changes"><div class="back-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="back-matter-number">5</h3><h1 class="back-matter-title">2nd Edition Changes</h1></div><div class="ugc back-matter-ugc"> <p>During the spring of 2020, a team of collaborative post-secondary educators from across British Columbia and industry professionals came together to give the <em>Introduction to Tourism and Hospitality in BC</em> textbook a fresh update. These revisions focused on updating data and statistics as well as provided some needed content updates.</p> <p>At the same time as the plan for the second edition of the textbook started to come together in early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization. The ultimate impacts of COVID-19 on the tourism and hospitality industries at the time of editing is unknown, although it is clear that COVID-19 is a defining moment for tourism and hospitality locally in British Columbia, across Canada, and around the world. So much is unknown as to what the imminent tourism and hospitality landscape might bring. As such, the chapter edits have been kept predominantly pre-COVID. Several chapters refer to the crisis, but no assumptions are made as to what might lie ahead.</p> <p>All chapters now contain updated statistics, revised content, interactive H5P activities, and added references, all of which provide a more relevant and up-to-date reading experience. Crucial tourism organizations that have recently undergone name changes have been brought up to date, such as the Canadian Tourism Commission name change to Destination Canada and Aboriginal Tourism Canada and Aboriginal Tourism BC being revised to Indigenous Tourism Canada and Indigenous Tourism BC, respectively.</p> <p>Several chapters — such as <a class="internal" href="#part-customer-service" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/customer-service/">Chapter 9</a> on customer service, <a class="internal" href="#part-environmental-stewardship" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/environmental-stewardship/">Chapter 10</a> on environmental stewardship, and <a class="internal" href="#part-indigenous-tourism" data-url="/introtourism2e/part/indigenous-tourism/">Chapter 12</a> on Indigenous tourism — have been substantially rewritten, as these areas have changed considerably over the last several years. Internet links throughout have been reviewed and updated, along with several modernized end-of-chapter exercises and case studies throughout the text. Lastly, glossary terms have been hyperlinked.</p> </div></div>
