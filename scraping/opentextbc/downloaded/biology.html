As such, this course represents an important opportunity for students to develop the necessary knowledge, tools, and skills to make informed decisions as they continue with their lives. Rather than being mired down with facts and vocabulary, the typical non-science major student needs information presented in a way that is easy to read and understand. Even more importantly, the content should be meaningful. Students do much better when they understand why biology is relevant to their everyday lives. For these reasons,&nbsp;<em>Concepts of Biology</em> is grounded on an evolutionary basis and includes exciting features that highlight careers in the biological sciences and everyday applications of the concepts at hand. We also strive to show the interconnectedness of topics within this extremely broad discipline. In order to meet the needs of today’s instructors and students, we maintain the overall organization and coverage found in most syllabi for this course. A strength of <em>Concepts of Biology</em> is that instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom. <em>Concepts of Biology</em> also includes an innovative art program that incorporates critical thinking and clicker questions to help students understand—and apply—key concepts.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-643"><h2>Coverage and Scope</h2> <p id="eip-238">Our <em>Concepts of Biology</em> textbook adheres to the scope and sequence of most one-semester non-majors courses nationwide. We also strive to make biology, as a discipline, interesting and accessible to students. In addition to a comprehensive coverage of core concepts and foundational research, we have incorporated features that draw learners into the discipline in meaningful ways. Our scope of content was developed after surveying over a hundred biology professors and listening to their coverage needs. We provide a thorough treatment of biology’s fundamental concepts with a scope that is manageable for instructors and students alike.</p> <ul id="eip-367"><li>Unit 1: <strong>The Cellular Foundation of Life</strong>. Our opening unit introduces students to the sciences, including the process of science and the underlying concepts from the physical sciences that provide a framework within which learners comprehend biological processes. Additionally, students will gain solid understanding of the structures, functions, and processes of the most basic unit of life: the cell.</li> <li>Unit 2: <strong>Cell Division and Genetics</strong>. Our genetics unit takes learners from the foundations of cellular reproduction to the experiments that revealed the basis of genetics and laws of inheritance.</li> <li>Unit 3: <strong>Molecular Biology and Biotechnology</strong>. Students will learn the intricacies of DNA, protein synthesis, and gene regulation and current applications of biotechnology and genomics.</li> <li>Unit 4: <strong>Evolution and the Diversity of Life</strong>. The core concepts of evolution are discussed in this unit with examples illustrating evolutionary processes. Additionally, the evolutionary basis of biology reappears throughout the textbook in general discussion and is reinforced through special call-out features highlighting specific evolution-based topics. The diversity of life is explored with detailed study of various organisms and discussion of emerging phylogenetic relationships between and among bacteria, protist kingdoms, fungi, plants, and animals.</li> <li>Unit 5: <strong>Animal Structure and Function</strong>. An introduction to the form and function of the animal body is followed by chapters on the immune system and animal development. This unit touches on the biology of all organisms while maintaining an engaging focus on human anatomy and physiology that helps students connect to the topics.</li> <li>Unit 6: <strong>Ecology</strong>. Ecological concepts are broadly covered in this unit, with features highlighting localized, real-world issues of conservation and biodiversity.</li> </ul> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-443"><h2>Pedagogical Foundation and Features</h2> <p id="eip-603">Because of the impact science has on students and society, an important goal of science education is to achieve a scientifically literate population that consistently makes informed decisions. Scientific literacy transcends a basic understanding of scientific principles and processes to include the ability to make sense of the myriad instances where people encounter science in day-to-day life. Thus, a scientifically literate person is one who uses science content knowledge to make informed decisions, either personally or socially, about topics or issues that have a connection with science. <em>Concepts of Biology</em> is grounded on a solid scientific base and designed to promote scientific literacy. Throughout the text, you will find features that engage the students in scientific inquiry by taking selected topics a step further.</p> <ul id="eip-177"><li><strong>Evolution in Action</strong> features uphold the importance of evolution to all biological study through discussions like “Global Decline of Coral Reefs” and “The Red Queen Hypothesis.”</li> <li><strong>Career in Action</strong> features present information on a variety of careers in the biological sciences, introducing students to the educational requirements and day-to-day work life of a variety of professions, such as forensic scientists, registered dietitians, and biogeographers.</li> <li><strong>Biology in Action</strong> features tie biological concepts to emerging issues and discuss science in terms of everyday life. Topics include “Invasive Species” and “Photosynthesis at the Grocery Store.”</li> </ul> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-793"><h2>Art and Animations that Engage</h2> <p id="eip-864">Our art program takes a straightforward approach designed to help students learn the concepts of biology through simple, effective illustrations, photos, and micrographs. <em>Concepts of Biology</em> also incorporates links to relevant animations and interactive exercises that help bring biology to life for students.</p> <ul id="eip-91"><li><strong>Concepts in Action</strong> features direct students to online interactive exercises and animations to add a fuller context and examples to core content.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-759"><h1>About Our Team</h1> <p id="eip-121"><em>Concepts of Biology</em> would not be possible if not for the tremendous contributions of the authors and community reviewing team</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-id8320483"><h2>Senior Contributors</h2> <ul><li>Samantha Fowler, Clayton State University</li> <li>Rebecca Roush, Sandhills Community College</li> <li>James Wise, Hampton University</li> </ul> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="eip-id4438849"><h2>Faculty Contributors and Reviewers</h2> <ul class="twocolumn"><li>Mark Belk, Brigham Young University</li> <li>Lisa Boggs, Southwestern Oklahoma State University</li> <li>Sherryl Broverman, Duke University</li> <li>David Byres, Florida State College at Jacksonville</li> <li>Aaron Cassill, The University of Texas at San Antonio</li> <li>Karen Champ, College of Central Florida</li> <li>Sue Chaplin, University of St. Thomas</li> <li>Diane Day, Clayton State University</li> <li>Jean DeSaix, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill</li> <li>David Hunnicutt, St. Norbert College</li> <li>Barbara Kuehner, Hawaii Community College</li> <li>Brenda Leady, University of Toledo</li> <li>Bernie Marcus, Genesee Community College</li> <li>Flora Mhlanga, Lipscomb University</li> <li>Madeline Mignone, Dominican College</li> <li>Elizabeth Nash, Long Beach City College</li> <li>Mark Newton, San Jose City College</li> <li>Diana Oliveras, University of Colorado Boulder</li> <li>Ann Paterson, Williams Baptist College</li> <li>Joel Piperberg, Millersville University</li> <li>Nick Reeves, Mt.

What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious answer, but it is not easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.</p> <p id="fs-idm11911600">From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how did this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp10605856"><h1>Properties of Life</h1> <p id="fs-idm15862480">All groups of living organisms share multiple key characteristics or functions: order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. When viewed together, these eight characteristics serve to define life.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm48835200"><h2>Order</h2> <p id="fs-idm29231504">Organisms are highly organized structures that consist of one or more cells. Even very simple, single-celled organisms are remarkably complex. Inside each cell, atoms make up molecules. These in turn make up cell components or organelles. Multicellular organisms, which may consist of millions of individual cells, have an advantage over single-celled organisms in that their cells can be specialized to perform specific functions, and even sacrificed in certain situations for the good of the organism as a whole. How these specialized cells come together to form organs such as the heart, lung, or skin in organisms like the toad shown in Figure 1. 2 will be discussed later.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_01"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_30" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-30" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4310" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_01_01_01-300x1952-1.jpg" alt="A photo shows a light-colored toad covered in bright green spots." width="400" height="260" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_01_01_01-300x1952-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_01_01_01-300x1952-1-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_01_01_01-300x1952-1-225x146.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-30">Figure 1.2 A toad represents a highly organized structure consisting of cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm29469440"><h2>Sensitivity or Response to Stimuli</h2> <p id="fs-idm48163904">Organisms respond to diverse stimuli.

Many multicellular organisms (those made up of more than one cell) produce specialized reproductive cells that will form new individuals. When reproduction occurs, DNA containing genes is passed along to an organism’s offspring. These genes are the reason that the offspring will belong to the same species and will have characteristics similar to the parent, such as fur color and blood type.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm59408480"><h2>Adaptation</h2> <p id="fs-idm83575392">All living organisms exhibit a “fit” to their environment. Biologists refer to this fit as adaptation and it is a consequence of evolution by natural selection, which operates in every lineage of reproducing organisms. Examples of adaptations are diverse and unique, from heat-resistant Archaea that live in boiling hot springs to the tongue length of a nectar-feeding moth that matches the size of the flower from which it feeds. All adaptations enhance the reproductive potential of the individual exhibiting them, including their ability to survive to reproduce. Adaptations are not constant. As an environment changes, natural selection causes the characteristics of the individuals in a population to track those changes.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm65258208"><h2>Growth and Development</h2> <p id="fs-idm61791968">Organisms grow and develop according to specific instructions coded for by their genes.

For example, organ systems such as the digestive or circulatory systems perform specific functions like carrying oxygen throughout the body, removing wastes, delivering nutrients to every cell, and cooling the body.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm44083744"><h2>Homeostasis</h2> <p id="fs-idm45460048">To function properly, cells require appropriate conditions such as proper temperature, pH, and concentrations of diverse chemicals. These conditions may, however, change from one moment to the next. Organisms are able to maintain internal conditions within a narrow range almost constantly, despite environmental changes, through a process called homeostasis or “steady state”—the ability of an organism to maintain constant internal conditions. For example, many organisms regulate their body temperature in a process known as thermoregulation. Organisms that live in cold climates, such as the polar bear, have body structures that help them withstand low temperatures and conserve body heat. In hot climates, organisms have methods (such as perspiration in humans or panting in dogs) that help them to shed excess body heat.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_04"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_34" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-34" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4314" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_04-300x2142-1.jpg" alt="This photo shows a white, furry polar bear." width="400" height="285" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_04-300x2142-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_04-300x2142-1-65x46.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_04-300x2142-1-225x161.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-34">Figure 1.5 Polar bears and other mammals living in ice-covered regions maintain their body temperature by generating heat and reducing heat loss through thick fur and a dense layer of fat under their skin.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm58873920"><h2>Energy Processing</h2> <p id="fs-idm82045936">All organisms (such as the California condor shown in Figure 1.6) use a source of energy for their metabolic activities.

A <strong>molecule</strong> is a chemical structure consisting of at least two atoms held together by a chemical bond.

Organelles are small structures that exist within cells and perform specialized functions. All living things are made of cells; the cell itself is the smallest fundamental unit of structure and function in living organisms. (This requirement is why viruses are not considered living: they are not made of cells. To make new viruses, they have to invade and hijack a living cell; only then can they obtain the materials they need to reproduce.) Some organisms consist of a single cell and others are multicellular. Cells are classified as prokaryotic or eukaryotic. Prokaryotes are single-celled organisms that lack organelles surrounded by a membrane and do not have nuclei surrounded by nuclear membranes; in contrast, the cells of eukaryotes do have membrane-bound organelles and nuclei.</p> <p id="fs-idm28612144">In most multicellular organisms, cells combine to make tissues, which are groups of similar cells carrying out the same function. Organs are collections of tissues grouped together based on a common function. Organs are present not only in animals but also in plants. An organ system is a higher level of organization that consists of functionally related organs. For example vertebrate animals have many organ systems, such as the circulatory system that transports blood throughout the body and to and from the lungs; it includes organs such as the heart and blood vessels. Organisms are individual living entities. For example, each tree in a forest is an organism. Single-celled prokaryotes and single-celled eukaryotes are also considered organisms and are typically referred to as microorganisms.</p> <div id="fs-idm40888688" class="art-connection"><div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_07"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_38" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38" style="width: 208px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_07.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_07.png"><img class="wp-image-4318" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_072.png" alt="A flow chart shows the hierarchy of living organisms.

For example, the forest with the pine trees includes populations of flowering plants and also insects and microbial populations. A community is the set of populations inhabiting a particular area. For instance, all of the trees, flowers, insects, and other populations in a forest form the forest’s community. The forest itself is an ecosystem. An ecosystem consists of all the living things in a particular area together with the abiotic, or non-living, parts of that environment such as nitrogen in the soil or rainwater.

The source of this diversity is evolution, the process of gradual change during which new species arise from older species. Evolutionary biologists study the evolution of living things in everything from the microscopic world to ecosystems.</p> <p id="fs-idm25429264">In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus first proposed organizing the known species of organisms into a hierarchical taxonomy. In this system, species that are most similar to each other are put together within a grouping known as a genus. Furthermore, similar genera (the plural of genus) are put together within a family. This grouping continues until all organisms are collected together into groups at the highest level. The current taxonomic system now has eight levels in its hierarchy, from lowest to highest, they are: species, genus, family, order, class, phylum, kingdom, and domain. Thus species are grouped within genera, genera are grouped within families, families are grouped within orders, and so on.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_08"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_39" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-39" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_08.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_08.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4319" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1.jpg" alt="A chart shows the eight levels of taxonomic hierarchy for the dog, Canis lupus." width="500" height="241" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1-300x144.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1-768x370.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1-65x31.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1-225x108.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_08-1024x4932-1-350x169.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-39">Figure 1.9 This diagram shows the levels of taxonomic hierarchy for a dog, from the broadest category—domain—to the most specific—species.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm72098240">The highest level, domain, is a relatively new addition to the system since the 1990s. Scientists now recognize three domains of life, the Eukarya, the Archaea, and the Bacteria. The domain Eukarya contains organisms that have cells with nuclei. It includes the kingdoms of fungi, plants, animals, and several kingdoms of protists. The Archaea, are single-celled organisms without nuclei and include many extremophiles that live in harsh environments like hot springs. The Bacteria are another quite different group of single-celled organisms without nuclei. Both the Archaea and the Bacteria are prokaryotes, an informal name for cells without nuclei. The recognition in the 1990s that certain “bacteria,” now known as the Archaea, were as different genetically and biochemically from other bacterial cells as they were from eukaryotes, motivated the recommendation to divide life into three domains. This dramatic change in our knowledge of the tree of life demonstrates that classifications are not permanent and will change when new information becomes available.</p> <p id="fs-idm76440992">In addition to the hierarchical taxonomic system, Linnaeus was the first to name organisms using two unique names, now called the binomial naming system. Before Linnaeus, the use of common names to refer to organisms caused confusion because there were regional differences in these common names. Binomial names consist of the genus name (which is capitalized) and the species name (all lower-case). Both names are set in italics when they are printed. Every species is given a unique binomial which is recognized the world over, so that a scientist in any location can know which organism is being referred to. For example, the North American blue jay is known uniquely as <em>Cyanocitta cristata</em>.

A phylogenetic tree is a diagram showing the evolutionary relationships among biological species based on similarities and differences in genetic or physical traits or both. A phylogenetic tree is composed of branch points, or nodes, and branches. The internal nodes represent ancestors and are points in evolution when, based on scientific evidence, an ancestor is thought to have diverged to form two new species. The length of each branch can be considered as estimates of relative time.</p> <p id="fs-idm71571824">In the past, biologists grouped living organisms into five kingdoms: animals, plants, fungi, protists, and bacteria. The pioneering work of American microbiologist Carl Woese in the early 1970s has shown, however, that life on Earth has evolved along three lineages, now called domains—Bacteria, Archaea, and Eukarya. Woese proposed the domain as a new taxonomic level and Archaea as a new domain, to reflect the new phylogenetic tree. Many organisms belonging to the Archaea domain live under extreme conditions and are called extremophiles. To construct his tree, Woese used genetic relationships rather than similarities based on morphology (shape). Various genes were used in phylogenetic studies. Woese’s tree was constructed from comparative sequencing of the genes that are universally distributed, found in some slightly altered form in every organism, conserved (meaning that these genes have remained only slightly changed throughout evolution), and of an appropriate length.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_10"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_41" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_10.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4321" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102.jpg" alt="This phylogenetic tree shows that the three domains of life, bacteria, archaea and eukarya, all arose from a common ancestor." width="500" height="338" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102-300x203.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102-768x518.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102-225x152.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_102-350x236.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-41">Figure 1.11 This phylogenetic tree was constructed by microbiologist Carl Woese using genetic relationships.

Biologists may pursue one of those sub disciplines and work in a more focused field. For instance, molecular biology studies biological processes at the molecular level, including interactions among molecules such as DNA, RNA, and proteins, as well as the way they are regulated. Microbiology is the study of the structure and function of microorganisms. It is quite a broad branch itself, and depending on the subject of study, there are also microbial physiologists, ecologists, and geneticists, among others.</p> <p id="fs-idm75927680">Another field of biological study, neurobiology, studies the biology of the nervous system, and although it is considered a branch of biology, it is also recognized as an interdisciplinary field of study known as neuroscience.

Zoology and botany are the study of animals and plants, respectively. Biologists can also specialize as biotechnologists, ecologists, or physiologists, to name just a few areas. Biotechnologists apply the knowledge of biology to create useful products. Ecologists study the interactions of organisms in their environments. Physiologists study the workings of cells, tissues and organs. This is just a small sample of the many fields that biologists can pursue. From our own bodies to the world we live in, discoveries in biology can affect us in very direct and important ways. We depend on these discoveries for our health, our food sources, and the benefits provided by our ecosystem. Because of this, knowledge of biology can benefit us in making decisions in our day-to-day lives.</p> <p id="fs-idm78647248">The development of technology in the twentieth century that continues today, particularly the technology to describe and manipulate the genetic material, DNA, has transformed biology. This transformation will allow biologists to continue to understand the history of life in greater detail, how the human body works, our human origins, and how humans can survive as a species on this planet despite the stresses caused by our increasing numbers. Biologists continue to decipher huge mysteries about life suggesting that we have only begun to understand life on the planet, its history, and our relationship to it. For this and other reasons, the knowledge of biology gained through this textbook and other printed and electronic media should be a benefit in whichever field you enter.</p> <div id="fs-idm74894912" class="career non-majors"><div class="bc-section section"><h2>Forensic Scientist</h2> <p id="fs-idm80622272">Forensic science is the application of science to answer questions related to the law. Biologists as well as chemists and biochemists can be forensic scientists. Forensic scientists provide scientific evidence for use in courts, and their job involves examining trace material associated with crimes. Interest in forensic science has increased in the last few years, possibly because of popular television shows that feature forensic scientists on the job. Also, the development of molecular techniques and the establishment of DNA databases have updated the types of work that forensic scientists can do. Their job activities are primarily related to crimes against people such as murder, rape, and assault. Their work involves analyzing samples such as hair, blood, and other body fluids and also processing DNA found in many different environments and materials. Forensic scientists also analyze other biological evidence left at crime scenes, such as insect parts or pollen grains. Students who want to pursue careers in forensic science will most likely be required to take chemistry and biology courses as well as some intensive math courses.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_01_12"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_43" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_12.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_01_12.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4323" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122.jpg" alt="Photo depicts a scientist working in a lab." width="400" height="279" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122-300x209.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122-225x157.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_01_122-350x244.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-43">Figure 1.13 This forensic scientist works in a DNA extraction room at the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Laboratory.</div></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm107479568"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm55696240">Biology is the science of life. All living organisms share several key properties such as order, sensitivity or response to stimuli, reproduction, adaptation, growth and development, regulation, homeostasis, and energy processing. Living things are highly organized following a hierarchy that includes atoms, molecules, organelles, cells, tissues, organs, and organ systems. Organisms, in turn, are grouped as populations, communities, ecosystems, and the biosphere. Evolution is the source of the tremendous biological diversity on Earth today. A diagram called a phylogenetic tree can be used to show evolutionary relationships among organisms. Biology is very broad and includes many branches and sub disciplines. Examples include molecular biology, microbiology, neurobiology, zoology, and botany, among others.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Specifically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers who work individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social enterprise like politics or the arts. The methods of science include careful observation, record keeping, logical and mathematical reasoning, experimentation, and submitting conclusions to the scrutiny of others. Science also requires considerable imagination and creativity; a well-designed experiment is commonly described as elegant, or beautiful. Like politics, science has considerable practical implications and some science is dedicated to practical applications, such as the prevention of disease. Other science proceeds largely motivated by curiosity. Whatever its goal, there is no doubt that science, including biology, has transformed human existence and will continue to do so.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4327" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022.jpg" alt="Scanning electronic micrograph depicts E. coli bacteria aggregated together." width="400" height="290" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022-300x218.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022-65x47.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022-225x163.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_022-350x254.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-46">Figure 1.15 Biologists may choose to study Escherichia coli (E. coli), a bacterium that is a normal resident of our digestive tracts but which is also sometimes responsible for disease outbreaks.

What does the study of biology share with other scientific disciplines? Science (from the Latin <em>scientia,</em> meaning “knowledge”) can be defined as knowledge about the natural world.</p> <p id="fs-idm59915632">Science is a very specific way of learning, or knowing, about the world. The history of the past 500 years demonstrates that science is a very powerful way of knowing about the world; it is largely responsible for the technological revolutions that have taken place during this time. There are however, areas of knowledge and human experience that the methods of science cannot be applied to. These include such things as answering purely moral questions, aesthetic questions, or what can be generally categorized as spiritual questions. Science has cannot investigate these areas because they are outside the realm of material phenomena, the phenomena of matter and energy, and cannot be observed and measured.</p> <p id="fs-idm39188768">The scientific method is a method of research with defined steps that include experiments and careful observation. The steps of the scientific method will be examined in detail later, but one of the most important aspects of this method is the testing of hypotheses. A hypothesis is a suggested explanation for an event, which can be tested. <strong>Hypotheses</strong>, or <strong>tentative explanations</strong>, are generally produced within the context of a scientific theory. A <strong>scientific theory </strong>is a generally accepted, thoroughly tested and confirmed explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. Scientific theory is the foundation of scientific knowledge. In addition, in many scientific disciplines (less so in biology) there are scientific laws, often expressed in mathematical formulas, which describe how elements of nature will behave under certain specific conditions. There is not an evolution of hypotheses through theories to laws as if they represented some increase in certainty about the world. Hypotheses are the day-to-day material that scientists work with and they are developed within the context of theories. Laws are concise descriptions of parts of the world that are amenable to formulaic or mathematical description.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm82353344"><h2>Natural Sciences</h2> <p id="fs-idm4412992">What would you expect to see in a museum of natural sciences?

Science includes such diverse fields as astronomy, biology, computer sciences, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics. However, those fields of science related to the physical world and its phenomena and processes are considered natural sciences. Thus, a museum of natural sciences might contain any of the items listed above.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"></div>&nbsp; <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_47" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-47" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4328" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_03-300x3002-1.jpg" alt="Some fields of science include astronomy, biology, computer science, geology, logic, physics, chemistry, and mathematics.

For some experts, the natural sciences are astronomy, biology, chemistry, earth science, and physics. Other scholars choose to divide natural sciences into life sciences, which study living things and include biology, and physical sciences, which study nonliving matter and include astronomy, physics, and chemistry. Some disciplines such as biophysics and biochemistry build on two sciences and are interdisciplinary.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm63402272"><h2>Scientific Inquiry</h2> <p id="fs-idm78525200">One thing is common to all forms of science: an ultimate goal “to know.” Curiosity and inquiry are the driving forces for the development of science. Scientists seek to understand the world and the way it operates. Two methods of logical thinking are used: inductive reasoning and deductive reasoning.</p> <p id="fs-idm69789168">Inductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses related observations to arrive at a general conclusion. This type of reasoning is common in descriptive science. A life scientist such as a biologist makes observations and records them. These data can be qualitative (descriptive) or quantitative (consisting of numbers), and the raw data can be supplemented with drawings, pictures, photos, or videos. From many observations, the scientist can infer conclusions (inductions) based on evidence. Inductive reasoning involves formulating generalizations inferred from careful observation and the analysis of a large amount of data. Brain studies often work this way. Many brains are observed while people are doing a task. The part of the brain that lights up, indicating activity, is then demonstrated to be the part controlling the response to that task.</p> <p id="fs-idm64642176">Deductive reasoning or deduction is the type of logic used in hypothesis-based science. In deductive reasoning, the pattern of thinking moves in the opposite direction as compared to inductive reasoning. Deductive reasoning is a form of logical thinking that uses a general principle or law to forecast specific results. From those general principles, a scientist can extrapolate and predict the specific results that would be valid as long as the general principles are valid. For example, a prediction would be that if the climate is becoming warmer in a region, the distribution of plants and animals should change. Comparisons have been made between distributions in the past and the present, and the many changes that have been found are consistent with a warming climate. Finding the change in distribution is evidence that the climate change conclusion is a valid one.</p> <p id="fs-idm79419648">Both types of logical thinking are related to the two main pathways of scientific study: descriptive science and hypothesis-based science. Descriptive (or discovery) science aims to observe, explore, and discover, while hypothesis-based science begins with a specific question or problem and a potential answer or solution that can be tested. The boundary between these two forms of study is often blurred, because most scientific endeavors combine both approaches. Observations lead to questions, questions lead to forming a hypothesis as a possible answer to those questions, and then the hypothesis is tested. Thus, descriptive science and hypothesis-based science are in continuous dialogue.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm87395952"><h1>Hypothesis Testing</h1> <p id="fs-idm87262240">Biologists study the living world by posing questions about it and seeking science-based responses. This approach is common to other sciences as well and is often referred to as the scientific method. The scientific method was used even in ancient times, but it was first documented by England’s Sir Francis Bacon (1561–1626), who set up inductive methods for scientific inquiry. The scientific method is not exclusively used by biologists but can be applied to almost anything as a logical problem-solving method.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_02_04"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_48" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-48" style="width: 244px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4329" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_04-183x3002-1.jpg" alt="Painting depicts Sir Francis Bacon in a long cloak." width="244" height="400" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_04-183x3002-1.jpg 183w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_04-183x3002-1-65x107.jpg 65w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-48">Figure1.17 Sir Francis Bacon is credited with being the first to document the scientific method.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm115876416">The scientific process typically starts with an observation (often a problem to be solved) that leads to a question. Let’s think about a simple problem that starts with an observation and apply the scientific method to solve the problem. One Monday morning, a student arrives at class and quickly discovers that the classroom is too warm. That is an observation that also describes a problem: the classroom is too warm. The student then asks a question: “Why is the classroom so warm?”</p> <p id="fs-idm84410272">Recall that a hypothesis is a suggested explanation that can be tested. To solve a problem, several hypotheses may be proposed. For example, one hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because no one turned on the air conditioning.” But there could be other responses to the question, and therefore other hypotheses may be proposed. A second hypothesis might be, “The classroom is warm because there is a power failure, and so the air conditioning doesn’t work.”</p> <p id="fs-idm95464864">Once a hypothesis has been selected, a prediction may be made. A prediction is similar to a hypothesis but it typically has the format “If . . . then . . . .” For example, the prediction for the first hypothesis might be, “<em>If</em> the student turns on the air conditioning, <em>then</em> the classroom will no longer be too warm.”</p> <p id="fs-idm17036784">A hypothesis must be testable to ensure that it is valid. For example, a hypothesis that depends on what a bear thinks is not testable, because it can never be known what a bear thinks. It should also be falsifiable, meaning that it can be disproven by experimental results. An example of an unfalsifiable hypothesis is “Botticelli’s <em>Birth of Venus</em> is beautiful.” There is no experiment that might show this statement to be false. To test a hypothesis, a researcher will conduct one or more experiments designed to eliminate one or more of the hypotheses. This is important. A hypothesis can be disproven, or eliminated, but it can never be proven. Science does not deal in proofs like mathematics. If an experiment fails to disprove a hypothesis, then we find support for that explanation, but this is not to say that down the road a better explanation will not be found, or a more carefully designed experiment will be found to falsify the hypothesis.</p> <p id="fs-idm67940480">Each experiment will have one or more variables and one or more controls. A variable is any part of the experiment that can vary or change during the experiment. A control is a part of the experiment that does not change. Look for the variables and controls in the example that follows. As a simple example, an experiment might be conducted to test the hypothesis that phosphate limits the growth of algae in freshwater ponds. A series of artificial ponds are filled with water and half of them are treated by adding phosphate each week, while the other half are treated by adding a salt that is known not to be used by algae. The variable here is the phosphate (or lack of phosphate), the experimental or treatment cases are the ponds with added phosphate and the control ponds are those with something inert added, such as the salt. Just adding something is also a control against the possibility that adding extra matter to the pond has an effect. If the treated ponds show lesser growth of algae, then we have found support for our hypothesis. If they do not, then we reject our hypothesis. Be aware that rejecting one hypothesis does not determine whether or not the other hypotheses can be accepted; it simply eliminates one hypothesis that is not valid . Using the scientific method, the hypotheses that are inconsistent with experimental data are rejected.</p> <div id="fs-idm139541328" class="art-connection"><div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_02_05"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_49" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_05.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_05.png"><img class="wp-image-4330" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_052.png" alt="A flow chart shows the steps in the scientific method.

Sometimes an experiment leads to conclusions that favour a change in approach; often, an experiment brings entirely new scientific questions to the puzzle. Many times, science does not operate in a linear fashion; instead, scientists continually draw inferences and make generalizations, finding patterns as their research proceeds.

Is it valuable to pursue science for the sake of simply gaining knowledge, or does scientific knowledge only have worth if we can apply it to solving a specific problem or bettering our lives? This question focuses on the differences between two types of science: basic science and applied science.</p> <p id="fs-idm91227664">Basic science or “pure” science seeks to expand knowledge regardless of the short-term application of that knowledge. It is not focused on developing a product or a service of immediate public or commercial value. The immediate goal of basic science is knowledge for knowledge’s sake, though this does not mean that in the end it may not result in an application.</p> <p id="fs-idm12962608">In contrast, applied science or “technology,” aims to use science to solve real-world problems, making it possible, for example, to improve a crop yield, find a cure for a particular disease, or save animals threatened by a natural disaster. In applied science, the problem is usually defined for the researcher.</p> <p id="fs-idm77232368">Some individuals may perceive applied science as “useful” and basic science as “useless.” A question these people might pose to a scientist advocating knowledge acquisition would be, “What for?” A careful look at the history of science, however, reveals that basic knowledge has resulted in many remarkable applications of great value. Many scientists think that a basic understanding of science is necessary before an application is developed; therefore, applied science relies on the results generated through basic science. Other scientists think that it is time to move on from basic science and instead to find solutions to actual problems. Both approaches are valid. It is true that there are problems that demand immediate attention; however, few solutions would be found without the help of the knowledge generated through basic science.</p> <p id="fs-idm73592272">One example of how basic and applied science can work together to solve practical problems occurred after the discovery of DNA structure led to an understanding of the molecular mechanisms governing DNA replication. Strands of DNA, unique in every human, are found in our cells, where they provide the instructions necessary for life. During DNA replication, new copies of DNA are made, shortly before a cell divides to form new cells. Understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication enabled scientists to develop laboratory techniques that are now used to identify genetic diseases, pinpoint individuals who were at a crime scene, and determine paternity. Without basic science, it is unlikely that applied science would exist.</p> <p id="fs-idm75996944">Another example of the link between basic and applied research is the Human Genome Project, a study in which each human chromosome was analyzed and mapped to determine the precise sequence of DNA subunits and the exact location of each gene. (The gene is the basic unit of heredity; an individual’s complete collection of genes is his or her genome.) Other organisms have also been studied as part of this project to gain a better understanding of human chromosomes. The Human Genome Project&nbsp; relied on basic research carried out with non-human organisms and, later, with the human genome. An important end goal eventually became using the data for applied research seeking cures for genetically related diseases.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch01_02_06"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_50" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-50" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_01_02_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4331" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_01_02_06-300x3002-1.jpg" alt="The human genome project’s logo is shown, depicting a human being inside a DNA double helix.

Penicillin was discovered when biologist Alexander Fleming accidentally left a petri dish of <em>Staphylococcus</em> bacteria open. An unwanted mold grew, killing the bacteria. The mold turned out to be <em>Penicillium</em>, and a new antibiotic was discovered. Even in the highly organized world of science, luck—when combined with an observant, curious mind—can lead to unexpected breakthroughs.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm67355696"><h1>Reporting Scientific Work</h1> <p id="fs-idm90442736">Whether scientific research is basic science or applied science, scientists must share their findings for other researchers to expand and build upon their discoveries. Communication and collaboration within and between sub disciplines of science are key to the advancement of knowledge in science. For this reason, an important aspect of a scientist’s work is disseminating results and communicating with peers. Scientists can share results by presenting them at a scientific meeting or conference, but this approach can reach only the limited few who are present. Instead, most scientists present their results in peer-reviewed articles that are published in scientific journals. Peer-reviewed articles are scientific papers that are reviewed, usually anonymously by a scientist’s colleagues, or peers. These colleagues are qualified individuals, often experts in the same research area, who judge whether or not the scientist’s work is suitable for publication. The process of peer review helps to ensure that the research described in a scientific paper or grant proposal is original, significant, logical, and thorough. Grant proposals, which are requests for research funding, are also subject to peer review. Scientists publish their work so other scientists can reproduce their experiments under similar or different conditions to expand on the findings. The experimental results must be consistent with the findings of other scientists.</p> <p id="fs-idm136577440">There are many journals and the popular press that do not use a peer-review system. A large number of online open-access journals, journals with articles available without cost, are now available many of which use rigorous peer-review systems, but some of which do not. Results of any studies published in these forums without peer review are not reliable and should not form the basis for other scientific work. In one exception, journals may allow a researcher to cite a personal communication from another researcher about unpublished results with the cited author’s permission.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm121064176"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm46020832">Biology is the science that studies living organisms and their interactions with one another and their environments.

Science has many fields; those fields related to the physical world and its phenomena are considered natural sciences.</p> <p id="fs-idm34468896">A hypothesis is a tentative explanation for an observation. A scientific theory is a well-tested and consistently verified explanation for a set of observations or phenomena. A scientific law is a description, often in the form of a mathematical formula, of the behaviour of an aspect of nature under certain circumstances. Two types of logical reasoning are used in science. Inductive reasoning uses results to produce general scientific principles.

In this chapter, we will discuss these important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements affect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life.

Many of these critical nutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life. These macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules formed? What functions do they serve?

Matter occupies space and has mass. All matter is composed of <strong>elements</strong>, substances that cannot be broken down or transformed chemically into other substances. Each element is made of atoms, each with a constant number of protons and unique properties. A total of 118 elements have been defined; however, only 92 occur naturally, and fewer than 30 are found in living cells. The remaining 26 elements are unstable and, therefore, do not exist for very long or are theoretical and have yet to be detected.</p> <p id="fs-idp2759584">Each element is designated by its chemical symbol (such as H, N, O, C, and Na), and possesses unique properties. These unique properties allow elements to combine and to bond with each other in specific ways.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm9670272"><h1>Atoms</h1> <p id="fs-idp27395136">An atom is the smallest component of an element that retains all of the chemical properties of that element. For example, one hydrogen atom has all of the properties of the element hydrogen, such as it exists as a gas at room temperature, and it bonds with oxygen to create a water molecule. Hydrogen atoms cannot be broken down into anything smaller while still retaining the properties of hydrogen. If a hydrogen atom were broken down into subatomic particles, it would no longer have the properties of hydrogen.</p> <p id="fs-idp64859728">At the most basic level, all organisms are made of a combination of elements. They contain atoms that combine together to form molecules. In multicellular organisms, such as animals, molecules can interact to form cells that combine to form tissues, which make up organs. These combinations continue until entire multicellular organisms are formed.</p> <p id="fs-idp57329056">All atoms contain <strong>protons</strong>, <strong>electrons</strong>, and <strong>neutrons</strong>. The only exception is hydrogen (H), which is made of one proton and one electron. A proton is a positively charged particle that resides in the <strong>nucleus </strong>(the core of the atom) of an atom and has a mass of 1 and a charge of +1. An electron is a negatively charged particle that travels in the space around the nucleus. In other words, it resides outside of the nucleus. It has a negligible mass and has a charge of –1.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch02_01_01"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_20" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-20" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4337" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_02_01_01-300x1862-1.jpg" alt="Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons surrounding the nucleus." width="400" height="248" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_02_01_01-300x1862-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_02_01_01-300x1862-1-65x40.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_02_01_01-300x1862-1-225x140.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-20">Figure 2.2 Atoms are made up of protons and neutrons located within the nucleus, and electrons surrounding the nucleus.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm28078720">Neutrons, like protons, reside in the nucleus of an atom. They have a mass of 1 and no charge. The positive (protons) and negative (electrons) charges balance each other in a neutral atom, which has a net zero charge.</p> <p id="fs-idp99369088">Because protons and neutrons each have a mass of 1, the mass of an atom is equal to the number of protons and neutrons of that atom. The number of electrons does not factor into the overall mass, because their mass is so small.</p> <p id="fs-idm113237872">As stated earlier, each element has its own unique properties. Each contains a different number of protons and neutrons, giving it its own atomic number and mass number. The <strong>atomic number</strong> of an element is equal to the number of protons that element contains. The <strong>mass number</strong>, or atomic mass, is the number of protons plus the number of neutrons of that element. Therefore, it is possible to determine the number of neutrons by subtracting the atomic number from the mass number.</p> <p id="fs-idp29810000">These numbers provide information about the elements and how they will react when combined. Different elements have different melting and boiling points, and are in different states (liquid, solid, or gas) at room temperature. They also combine in different ways. Some form specific types of bonds, whereas others do not. How they combine is based on the number of electrons present. Because of these characteristics, the elements are arranged into the <strong>periodic table of elements</strong>, a chart of the elements that includes the atomic number and relative atomic mass of each element. The periodic table also provides key information about the properties of elements —often indicated by color-coding. The arrangement of the table also shows how the electrons in each element are organized and provides important details about how atoms will react with each other to form molecules.</p> <p id="fs-idp17546768"><strong>Isotopes</strong> are different forms of the same element that have the same number of protons, but a different number of neutrons. Some elements, such as carbon, potassium, and uranium, have naturally occurring isotopes. Carbon-12, the most common isotope of carbon, contains six protons and six neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 12 (six protons and six neutrons) and an atomic number of 6 (which makes it carbon). Carbon-14 contains six protons and eight neutrons. Therefore, it has a mass number of 14 (six protons and eight neutrons) and an atomic number of 6, meaning it is still the element carbon. These two alternate forms of carbon are isotopes. Some isotopes are unstable and will lose protons, other subatomic particles, or energy to form more stable elements. These are called <strong>radioactive isotopes</strong> or radioisotopes.</p> <div id="fs-idm32005744" class="art-connection non-majors"><div class="" id="fig-ch02_01_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"></div><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_21" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-21" style="width: 800px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4338" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1.png" alt="Periodic table of elements." width="800" height="639" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1-300x240.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1-768x614.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1-65x52.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1-225x180.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_02-1024x8182-1-350x280.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-21">Figure 2.3 Arranged in columns and rows based on the characteristics of the elements, the periodic table provides key information about the elements and how they might interact with each other to form molecules.

This is a continuous process, so more <sup>14</sup>C is always being created. As a living organism develops, the relative level of <sup>14</sup>C in its body is equal to the concentration of <sup>14</sup>C in the atmosphere. When an organism dies, it is no longer ingesting <sup>14</sup>C, so the ratio will decline. <sup>14</sup>C decays to <sup>14</sup>N by a process called beta decay; it gives off energy in this slow process.</p> <p id="fs-idm56534432">After approximately 5,730 years, only one-half of the starting concentration of <sup>14</sup>C will have been converted to <sup>14</sup>N. The time it takes for half of the original concentration of an isotope to decay to its more stable form is called its half-life. Because the half-life of <sup>14</sup>C is long, it is used to age formerly living objects, such as fossils. Using the ratio of the <sup>14</sup>C concentration found in an object to the amount of <sup>14</sup>C detected in the atmosphere, the amount of the isotope that has not yet decayed can be determined. Based on this amount, the age of the fossil can be calculated to about 50,000 years. Isotopes with longer half-lives, such as potassium-40, are used to calculate the ages of older fossils. Through the use of carbon dating, scientists can reconstruct the ecology and biogeography of organisms living within the past 50,000 years.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch02_01_03"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_22" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-22" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4339" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032.jpg" alt="Photograph shows scientists digging pygmy mammoth skeleton fossils from the ground." width="400" height="321" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032-300x240.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032-65x52.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032-225x180.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_032-350x281.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-22">Figure 2.4 The age of remains that contain carbon and are less than about 50,000 years old, such as this pygmy mammoth, can be determined using carbon dating.</div></div> </div> </div> <div id="fs-idm2233728" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <h2><span id="fs-id3193850"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/isotopes2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></h2> <p id="fs-idp2572512">To learn more about atoms and isotopes, and how you can tell one isotope from another, visit this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/isotopes" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/isotopes">site</a> and run the simulation.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp98334368"><h1>Chemical Bonds</h1> <p id="fs-idm9038624">How elements interact with one another depends on how their electrons are arranged and how many openings for electrons exist at the outermost region where electrons are present in an atom. Electrons exist at energy levels that form shells around the nucleus. The closest shell can hold up to two electrons. The closest shell to the nucleus is always filled first, before any other shell can be filled. Hydrogen has one electron; therefore, it has only one spot occupied within the lowest shell. Helium has two electrons; therefore, it can completely fill the lowest shell with its two electrons. If you look at the periodic table, you will see that hydrogen and helium are the only two elements in the first row. This is because they only have electrons in their first shell. Hydrogen and helium are the only two elements that have the lowest shell and no other shells.</p> <p id="fs-idm34565216">The second and third energy levels can hold up to eight electrons. The eight electrons are arranged in four pairs and one position in each pair is filled with an electron before any pairs are completed.</p> <p id="fs-idm62752352">Looking at the periodic table again, you will notice that there are seven rows. These rows correspond to the number of shells that the elements within that row have. The elements within a particular row have increasing numbers of electrons as the columns proceed from left to right. Although each element has the same number of shells, not all of the shells are completely filled with electrons. If you look at the second row of the periodic table, you will find lithium (Li), beryllium (Be), boron (B), carbon (C), nitrogen (N), oxygen (O), fluorine (F), and neon (Ne). These all have electrons that occupy only the first and second shells. Lithium has only one electron in its outermost shell, beryllium has two electrons, boron has three, and so on, until the entire shell is filled with eight electrons, as is the case with neon.</p> <p id="fs-idm56538768">Not all elements have enough electrons to fill their outermost shells, but an atom is at its most stable when all of the electron positions in the outermost shell are filled. Because of these vacancies in the outermost shells, we see the formation of <strong>chemical bonds</strong>, or interactions between two or more of the same or different elements that result in the formation of molecules. To achieve greater stability, atoms will tend to completely fill their outer shells and will bond with other elements to accomplish this goal by sharing electrons, accepting electrons from another atom, or donating electrons to another atom. Because the outermost shells of the elements with low atomic numbers (up to calcium, with atomic number 20) can hold eight electrons, this is referred to as the <strong>octet rule</strong>. An element can donate, accept, or share electrons with other elements to fill its outer shell and satisfy the octet rule.</p> <p id="fs-idm7280128">When an atom does not contain equal numbers of protons and electrons, it is called an <strong>ion</strong>. Because the number of electrons does not equal the number of protons, each ion has a net charge. Positive ions are formed by losing electrons and are called <strong>cations</strong>. Negative ions are formed by gaining electrons and are called <strong>anions</strong>.</p> <p id="fs-idp27440032">For example, sodium only has one electron in its outermost shell. It takes less energy for sodium to donate that one electron than it does to accept seven more electrons to fill the outer shell. If sodium loses an electron, it now has 11 protons and only 10 electrons, leaving it with an overall charge of +1. It is now called a sodium ion.</p> <p id="fs-idp49551552">The chlorine atom has seven electrons in its outer shell. Again, it is more energy-efficient for chlorine to gain one electron than to lose seven. Therefore, it tends to gain an electron to create an ion with 17 protons and 18 electrons, giving it a net negative (–1) charge. It is now called a chloride ion. This movement of electrons from one element to another is referred to as <strong>electron transfer</strong>. As illustrates, a sodium atom (Na) only has one electron in its outermost shell, whereas a chlorine atom (Cl) has seven electrons in its outermost shell. A sodium atom will donate its one electron to empty its shell, and a chlorine atom will accept that electron to fill its shell, becoming chloride. Both ions now satisfy the octet rule and have complete outermost shells. Because the number of electrons is no longer equal to the number of protons, each is now an ion and has a +1 (sodium) or –1 (chloride) charge.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch02_01_04"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_24" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-24" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4341" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_04-300x2792-1.jpg" alt="Diagram shows electron transfer between elements." width="400" height="373" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_04-300x2792-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_04-300x2792-1-65x60.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_04-300x2792-1-225x209.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-24">Figure 2.5 Elements tend to fill their outermost shells with electrons. To do this, they can either donate or accept electrons from other elements.</div></div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp24704704"><h2>Ionic Bonds</h2> <p id="fs-idm32428240">There are four types of bonds or interactions: ionic, covalent, hydrogen bonds, and van der Waals interactions. Ionic and covalent bonds are strong interactions that require a larger energy input to break apart. When an element donates an electron from its outer shell, as in the sodium atom example above, a positive ion is formed. The element accepting the electron is now negatively charged. Because positive and negative charges attract, these ions stay together and form an <strong>ionic bond</strong>, or a bond between ions. The elements bond together with the electron from one element staying predominantly with the other element. When Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>–</sup> ions combine to produce NaCl, an electron from a sodium atom stays with the other seven from the chlorine atom, and the sodium and chloride ions attract each other in a lattice of ions with a net zero charge.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp15525888"><h2>Covalent Bonds</h2> <p id="fs-idp26168800">Another type of strong chemical bond between two or more atoms is a <strong>covalent bond</strong>. These bonds form when a pair of &nbsp;electrons is shared between two elements and are the strongest and most common form of chemical bond in living organisms. Covalent bonds form between the elements that make up the biological molecules in our cells. Unlike ionic bonds, covalent bonds do not dissociate in water.</p> <p id="fs-idm38245840">The hydrogen and oxygen atoms that combine to form water molecules are bound together by covalent bonds. The electron from the hydrogen atom divides its time between the outer shell of the hydrogen atom and the incomplete outer shell of the oxygen atom. To completely fill the outer shell of an oxygen atom, two electrons from two hydrogen atoms are needed, hence the subscript “2” in H<sub>2</sub>O. The electrons are shared between the atoms, dividing their time between them to “fill” the outer shell of each. This sharing is a lower energy state for all of the atoms involved than if they existed without their outer shells filled.</p> <p id="fs-idp152562192">There are two types of covalent bonds: polar and nonpolar. <strong>Nonpolar covalent bonds</strong> form between two atoms of the same element or between different elements that share the electrons equally. For example, an oxygen atom can bond with another oxygen atom to fill their outer shells. This association is nonpolar because the electrons will be equally distributed between each oxygen atom. Two covalent bonds form between the two oxygen atoms because oxygen requires two shared electrons to fill its outermost shell. Nitrogen atoms will form three covalent bonds (also called triple covalent) between two atoms of nitrogen because each nitrogen atom needs three electrons to fill its outermost shell. Another example of a nonpolar covalent bond is found in the methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) molecule. The carbon atom has four electrons in its outermost shell and needs four more to fill it. It gets these four from four hydrogen atoms, each atom providing one. These elements all share the electrons equally, creating four nonpolar covalent bonds.</p> <p id="fs-idm32800256">In a <strong>polar covalent bond</strong>, the electrons shared by the atoms spend more time closer to one nucleus than to the other nucleus. Because of the unequal distribution of electrons between the different nuclei, a slightly positive (δ+) or slightly negative (δ–) charge develops. The covalent bonds between hydrogen and oxygen atoms in water are polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time near the oxygen nucleus, giving it a small negative charge, than they spend near the hydrogen nuclei, giving these molecules a small positive charge.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp17526848"><h2>Hydrogen Bonds</h2> <p id="fs-idm3625312">Ionic and covalent bonds are strong bonds that require considerable energy to break. However, not all bonds between elements are ionic or covalent bonds. Weaker bonds can also form. These are attractions that occur between positive and negative charges that do not require much energy to break. Two weak bonds that occur frequently are <strong>hydrogen bonds</strong> and van der Waals interactions. These bonds give rise to the unique properties of water and the unique structures of DNA and proteins.</p> <p id="fs-idp3358416">When polar covalent bonds containing a hydrogen atom form, the hydrogen atom in that bond has a slightly positive charge. This is because the shared electron is pulled more strongly toward the other element and away from the hydrogen nucleus. Because the hydrogen atom is slightly positive (δ+), it will be attracted to neighboring negative partial charges (δ–). When this happens, a weak interaction occurs between the δ+ charge of the hydrogen atom of one molecule and the δ– charge of the other molecule. This interaction is called a hydrogen bond. This type of bond is common; for example, the liquid nature of water is caused by the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Hydrogen bonds give water the unique properties that sustain life. If it were not for hydrogen bonding, water would be a gas rather than a liquid at room temperature.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch02_01_06"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"></div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_26" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-26" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_01_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4342" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062.jpg" alt="Diagram showing hydrogen bonds formed between adjacent water molecules." width="400" height="196" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062-300x147.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062-65x32.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062-225x110.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_01_062-350x172.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-26">Figure 2.6 Hydrogen bonds form between slightly positive (δ+) and slightly negative (δ–) charges of polar covalent molecules, such as water.</div></div> <p id="fs-idm54714080">Hydrogen bonds can form between different molecules and they do not always have to include a water molecule. Hydrogen atoms in polar bonds within any molecule can form bonds with other adjacent molecules. For example, hydrogen bonds hold together two long strands of DNA to give the DNA molecule its characteristic double-stranded structure. Hydrogen bonds are also responsible for some of the three-dimensional structure of proteins.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm11427872"><h2>van der Waals Interactions</h2> <p id="fs-idp19579472">Like hydrogen bonds, <strong>van der Waals interactions</strong> are weak attractions or interactions between molecules. They occur between polar, covalently bound, atoms in different molecules. Some of these weak attractions are caused by temporary partial charges formed when electrons move around a nucleus. These weak interactions between molecules are important in biological systems.</p> <div id="eip-idp106855552" class="career non-majors"><h2>Radiography Technicians</h2> <p id="fs-idm106229104">Have you or anyone you know ever had a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan, a mammogram, or an X-ray? These tests produce images of your soft tissues and organs (as with an MRI or mammogram) or your bones (as happens in an X-ray) by using either radio waves or special isotopes (radiolabeled or fluorescently labeled) that are ingested or injected into the body. These tests provide data for disease diagnoses by creating images of your organs or skeletal system.</p> <p id="fs-idm33616496">MRI imaging works by subjecting hydrogen nuclei, which are abundant in the water in soft tissues, to fluctuating magnetic fields, which cause them to emit their own magnetic field. This signal is then read by sensors in the machine and interpreted by a computer to form a detailed image.</p> <p id="fs-idm54701120">Some radiography technologists and technicians specialize in computed tomography, MRI, and mammography. They produce films or images of the body that help medical professionals examine and diagnose. Radiologists work directly with patients, explaining machinery, preparing them for exams, and ensuring that their body or body parts are positioned correctly to produce the needed images. Physicians or radiologists then analyze the test results.</p> <p id="fs-idm31814000">Radiography technicians can work in hospitals, doctors’ offices, or specialized imaging centers.

It is because water is essential to life; even minute traces of it on another planet can indicate that life could or did exist on that planet. Water is one of the more abundant molecules in living cells and the one most critical to life as we know it. Approximately 60–70 percent of your body is made up of water. Without it, life simply would not exist.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp106656032"><h1>Water Is Polar</h1> <p id="fs-idm38014528">The hydrogen and oxygen atoms within water molecules form polar covalent bonds. The shared electrons spend more time associated with the oxygen atom than they do with hydrogen atoms. There is no overall charge to a water molecule, but there is a slight positive charge on each hydrogen atom and a slight negative charge on the oxygen atom. Because of these charges, the slightly positive hydrogen atoms repel each other and form the unique shape. Each water molecule attracts other water molecules because of the positive and negative charges in the different parts of the molecule. Water also attracts other polar molecules (such as sugars), forming hydrogen bonds. When a substance readily forms hydrogen bonds with water, it can dissolve in water and is referred to as <strong>hydrophilic </strong>(“water-loving”). Hydrogen bonds are not readily formed with nonpolar substances like oils and fats . These nonpolar compounds are <strong>hydrophobic </strong>(“water-fearing”) and will not dissolve in water.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.2"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_54" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-54" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4345" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012.jpg" alt="Picture of oil in water." width="400" height="351" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012-300x264.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012-65x57.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012-225x198.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_02_012-350x308.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-54">Figure 2.7 As this macroscopic image of oil and water shows, oil is a nonpolar compound and, hence, will not dissolve in water.

As the motion increases, energy is higher and thus temperature is higher. Water absorbs a great deal of energy before its temperature rises. Increased energy disrupts the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. Because these bonds can be created and disrupted rapidly, water absorbs an increase in energy and temperature changes only minimally. This means that water moderates temperature changes within organisms and in their environments. As energy input continues, the balance between hydrogen-bond formation and destruction swings toward the destruction side. More bonds are broken than are formed. This process results in the release of individual water molecules at the surface of the liquid (such as a body of water, the leaves of a plant, or the skin of an organism) in a process called <strong>evaporation</strong>. Evaporation of sweat, which is 90 percent water, allows for cooling of an organism, because breaking hydrogen bonds requires an input of energy and takes heat away from the body.</p> <p id="fs-idp148423712">Conversely, as molecular motion decreases and temperatures drop, less energy is present to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules. These bonds remain intact and begin to form a rigid, lattice-like structure (e.g., ice) (Figure 2.8 <strong>a</strong>). When frozen, ice is less dense than liquid water (the molecules are farther apart). This means that ice floats on the surface of a body of water (Figure 2.8 <strong>b</strong>). In lakes, ponds, and oceans, ice will form on the surface of the water, creating an insulating barrier to protect the animal and plant life beneath from freezing in the water. If this did not happen, plants and animals living in water would freeze in a block of ice and could not move freely, making life in cold temperatures difficult or impossible.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.3"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_55" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-55" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4346" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_02-1024x4312-1.jpg" alt="Part A shows the lattice-like molecular structure of ice.

Water is, therefore, what is referred to as a <strong>solvent</strong>—a substance capable of dissolving another substance. The charged particles will form hydrogen bonds with a surrounding layer of water molecules. This is referred to as a sphere of hydration and serves to keep the particles separated or dispersed in the water. In the case of table salt (NaCl) mixed in water, the sodium and chloride ions separate, or dissociate, in the water, and spheres of hydration are formed around the ions. A positively charged sodium ion is surrounded by the partially negative charges of oxygen atoms in water molecules. A negatively charged chloride ion is surrounded by the partially positive charges of hydrogen atoms in water molecules. These spheres of hydration are also referred to as hydration shells.

Before it overflows, the water actually forms a dome-like shape above the rim of the glass. This water can stay above the glass because of the property of <strong>cohesion</strong>. In cohesion, water molecules are attracted to each other (because of hydrogen bonding), keeping the molecules together at the liquid-air (gas) interface, although there is no more room in the glass. Cohesion gives rise to <strong>surface tension</strong>, the capacity of a substance to withstand rupture when placed under tension or stress. When you drop a small scrap of paper onto a droplet of water, the paper floats on top of the water droplet, although the object is denser (heavier) than the water. This occurs because of the surface tension that is created by the water molecules. Cohesion and surface tension keep the water molecules intact and the item floating on the top. It is even possible to “float” a steel needle on top of a glass of water if you place it gently, without breaking the surface tension.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.5"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_58" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-58" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4348" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_04-300x1992-1.jpg" alt="Picture of a needle floating on top of water because of cohesion and surface tension." width="400" height="265" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_04-300x1992-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_04-300x1992-1-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_04-300x1992-1-225x149.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-58">Figure 2.10 The weight of a needle on top of water pulls the surface tension downward; at the same time, the surface tension of the water is pulling it up, suspending the needle on the surface of the water and keeping it from sinking.

This is observed when water “climbs” up a straw placed in a glass of water. You will notice that the water appears to be higher on the sides of the straw than in the middle. This is because the water molecules are attracted to the straw and therefore adhere to it.</p> <p id="fs-idm104886816">Cohesive and adhesive forces are important for sustaining life.

You have probably used <strong>litmus paper</strong>, paper that has been treated with a natural water-soluble dye so it can be used as a pH indicator, to test how much acid or base (alkalinity) exists in a solution. You might have even used some to make sure the water in an outdoor swimming pool is properly treated. In both cases, this pH test measures the amount of hydrogen ions that exists in a given solution. High concentrations of hydrogen ions yield a low pH, whereas low levels of hydrogen ions result in a high pH. The overall concentration of hydrogen ions is inversely related to its pH and can be measured on the <strong>pH scale</strong> (Figure 2.11). Therefore, the more hydrogen ions present, the lower the pH; conversely, the fewer hydrogen ions, the higher the pH.</p> <p id="fs-idm16790768">The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14. A change of one unit on the pH scale represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 10, a change in two units represents a change in the concentration of hydrogen ions by a factor of 100. Thus, small changes in pH represent large changes in the concentrations of hydrogen ions. Pure water is neutral. It is neither acidic nor basic, and has a pH of 7.0. Anything below 7.0 (ranging from 0.0 to 6.9) is acidic, and anything above 7.0 (from 7.1 to 14.0) is alkaline. The blood in your veins is slightly alkaline (pH = 7.4). The environment in your stomach is highly acidic (pH = 1 to 2). Orange juice is mildly acidic (pH = approximately 3.5), whereas baking soda is basic (pH = 9.0).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.6"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"></div>&nbsp; <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_60" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-60" style="width: 416px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_02_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4350" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052.jpg" alt="The pH scale with representative substances and their pHs." width="416" height="500" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052-250x300.jpg 250w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052-65x78.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052-225x270.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_02_052-350x421.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-60">Figure 2.11 The pH scale measures the amount of hydrogen ions (H+) in a substance.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp61087472"><strong>Acids </strong>are substances that provide hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) and lower pH, whereas <strong>bases </strong>provide hydroxide ions (OH<sup>–</sup>) and raise pH. The stronger the acid, the more readily it donates H<sup>+</sup>. For example, hydrochloric acid and lemon juice are very acidic and readily give up H<sup>+</sup> when added to water. Conversely, bases are those substances that readily donate OH<sup>–</sup>. The OH<sup>–</sup> ions combine with H<sup>+</sup> to produce water, which raises a substance’s pH. Sodium hydroxide and many household cleaners are very alkaline and give up OH<sup>–</sup> rapidly when placed in water, thereby raising the pH.</p> <p id="fs-idp93849984">Most cells in our bodies operate within a very narrow window of the pH scale, typically ranging only from 7.2 to 7.6. If the pH of the body is outside of this range, the respiratory system malfunctions, as do other organs in the body. Cells no longer function properly, and proteins will break down. Deviation outside of the pH range can induce coma or even cause death.</p> <p id="fs-idp58353184">So how is it that we can ingest or inhale acidic or basic substances and not die? Buffers are the key. <strong>Buffers</strong> readily absorb excess H<sup>+</sup> or OH<sup>–</sup>, keeping the pH of the body carefully maintained in the aforementioned narrow range. Carbon dioxide is part of a prominent buffer system in the human body; it keeps the pH within the proper range. This buffer system involves carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) and bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>) anion. If too much H<sup>+</sup> enters the body, bicarbonate will combine with the H<sup>+</sup> to create carbonic acid and limit the decrease in pH. Likewise, if too much OH<sup>–</sup> is introduced into the system, carbonic acid will rapidly dissociate into bicarbonate and H<sup>+</sup> ions. The H<sup>+</sup> ions can combine with the OH<sup>–</sup> ions, limiting the increase in pH. While carbonic acid is an important product in this reaction, its presence is fleeting because the carbonic acid is released from the body as carbon dioxide gas each time we breathe. Without this buffer system, the pH in our bodies would fluctuate too much and we would fail to survive.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm2353040"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm2559408">Water has many properties that are critical to maintaining life. It is polar, allowing for the formation of hydrogen bonds, which allow ions and other polar molecules to dissolve in water. Therefore, water is an excellent solvent. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules give water the ability to hold heat better than many other substances. As the temperature rises, the hydrogen bonds between water continually break and reform, allowing for the overall temperature to remain stable, although increased energy is added to the system. Water’s cohesive forces allow for the property of surface tension. All of these unique properties of water are important in the chemistry of living organisms.</p> <p>The pH of a solution is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in the solution. A solution with a high number of hydrogen ions is acidic and has a low pH value. A solution with a high number of hydroxide ions is basic and has a high pH value. The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14, with a pH of 7 being neutral. Buffers are solutions that moderate pH changes when an acid or base is added to the buffer system. Buffers are important in biological systems because of their ability to maintain constant pH conditions.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

There are four major classes of biological macromolecules (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids), and each is an important component of the cell and performs a wide array of functions. Combined, these molecules make up the majority of a cell’s mass. Biological macromolecules are organic, meaning that they contain carbon. In addition, they may contain hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur, and additional minor elements.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm25618912"><h1>Carbon</h1> <p id="fs-idm120518352">It is often said that life is “carbon-based.” This means that carbon atoms, bonded to other carbon atoms or other elements, form the fundamental components of many, if not most, of the molecules found uniquely in living things.

To lose weight, some individuals adhere to “low-carb” diets. Athletes, in contrast, often “carb-load” before important competitions to ensure that they have sufficient energy to compete at a high level. Carbohydrates are, in fact, an essential part of our diet; grains, fruits, and vegetables are all natural sources of carbohydrates. Carbohydrates provide energy to the body, particularly through glucose, a simple sugar. Carbohydrates also have other important functions in humans, animals, and plants.</p> <p id="fs-idm80257312">Carbohydrates can be represented by the formula (CH<sub>2</sub>O)<sub><em>n</em></sub>, where <em>n</em> is the number of carbon atoms in the molecule. In other words, the ratio of carbon to hydrogen to oxygen is 1:2:1 in carbohydrate molecules. Carbohydrates are classified into three subtypes: monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides.</p> <p id="fs-idp28290880"><strong>Monosaccharides </strong>(mono- = “one”; sacchar- = “sweet”) are simple sugars, the most common of which is glucose. In monosaccharides, the number of carbon atoms usually ranges from three to six. Most monosaccharide names end with the suffix -ose. Depending on the number of carbon atoms in the sugar, they may be known as trioses (three carbon atoms), pentoses (five carbon atoms), and hexoses (six carbon atoms).</p> <p id="fs-idm5863984">Monosaccharides may exist as a linear chain or as ring-shaped molecules; in aqueous solutions, they are usually found in the ring form.</p> <p id="fs-idp36550496">The chemical formula for glucose is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>. In most living species, glucose is an important source of energy. During cellular respiration, energy is released from glucose, and that energy is used to help make adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Plants synthesize glucose using carbon dioxide and water by the process of photosynthesis, and the glucose, in turn, is used for the energy requirements of the plant. The excess synthesized glucose is often stored as starch that is broken down by other organisms that feed on plants.</p> <p id="fs-idm52771664">Galactose (part of lactose, or milk sugar) and fructose (found in fruit) are other common monosaccharides. Although glucose, galactose, and fructose all have the same chemical formula (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>), they differ structurally and chemically (and are known as isomers) because of differing arrangements of atoms in the carbon chain.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.9"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_64" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-64" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4355" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032.jpg" alt="Chemical structures of glucose, galactose, and fructose." width="500" height="379" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032-300x227.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032-768x582.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032-225x170.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_032-350x265.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-64">Figure 2.14 Glucose, galactose, and fructose are isomeric monosaccharides, meaning that they have the same chemical formula but slightly different structures.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm14603296"><strong>Disaccharides </strong>(di- = “two”) form when two monosaccharides undergo a dehydration reaction (a reaction in which the removal of a water molecule occurs). During this process, the hydroxyl group (–OH) of one monosaccharide combines with a hydrogen atom of another monosaccharide, releasing a molecule of water (H<sub>2</sub>O) and forming a covalent bond between atoms in the two sugar molecules.</p> <p id="fs-idm57322464">Common disaccharides include lactose, maltose, and sucrose. Lactose is a disaccharide consisting of the monomers glucose and galactose. It is found naturally in milk. Maltose, or malt sugar, is a disaccharide formed from a dehydration reaction between two glucose molecules. The most common disaccharide is sucrose, or table sugar, which is composed of the monomers glucose and fructose.</p> <p id="fs-idm87414368">A long chain of monosaccharides linked by covalent bonds is known as a <strong>polysaccharide </strong>(poly- = “many”). The chain may be branched or unbranched, and it may contain different types of monosaccharides. Polysaccharides may be very large molecules. Starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin are examples of polysaccharides.</p> <p id="fs-idm65632"><strong>Starch </strong>is the stored form of sugars in plants and is made up of amylose and amylopectin (both polymers of glucose). Plants are able to synthesize glucose, and the excess glucose is stored as starch in different plant parts, including roots and seeds. The starch that is consumed by animals is broken down into smaller molecules, such as glucose. The cells can then absorb the glucose.</p> <p id="fs-idm55991536"><strong>Glycogen</strong> is the storage form of glucose in humans and other vertebrates, and is made up of monomers of glucose. Glycogen is the animal equivalent of starch and is a highly branched molecule usually stored in liver and muscle cells. Whenever glucose levels decrease, glycogen is broken down to release glucose.</p> <p id="fs-idp76517696"><strong>Cellulose </strong>is one of the most abundant natural biopolymers. The cell walls of plants are mostly made of cellulose, which provides structural support to the cell. Wood and paper are mostly cellulosic in nature. Cellulose is made up of glucose monomers that are linked by bonds between particular carbon atoms in the glucose molecule.</p> <p id="fs-idm19688368">Every other glucose monomer in cellulose is flipped over and packed tightly as extended long chains. This gives cellulose its rigidity and high tensile strength—which is so important to plant cells. Cellulose passing through our digestive system is called dietary fiber. While the glucose-glucose bonds in cellulose cannot be broken down by human digestive enzymes, herbivores such as cows, buffalos, and horses are able to digest grass that is rich in cellulose and use it as a food source. In these animals, certain species of bacteria reside in the rumen (part of the digestive system of herbivores) and secrete the enzyme cellulase. The appendix also contains bacteria that break down cellulose, giving it an important role in the digestive systems of ruminants. Cellulases can break down cellulose into glucose monomers that can be used as an energy source by the animal.</p> <p id="fs-idp28161680">Carbohydrates serve other functions in different animals. Arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and crabs, have an outer skeleton, called the exoskeleton, which protects their internal body parts. This exoskeleton is made of the biological macromolecule <strong>chitin</strong>, which is a nitrogenous carbohydrate. It is made of repeating units of a modified sugar containing nitrogen.</p> <p id="fs-idp131172320">Thus, through differences in molecular structure, carbohydrates are able to serve the very different functions of energy storage (starch and glycogen) and structural support and protection (cellulose and chitin).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4058" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4058" style="width: 600px"><a class="internal" href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_02_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4356" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04.jpg" alt="Chemical structures of starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin" width="600" height="428" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04.jpg 1115w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-300x214.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-1024x731.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-768x548.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-65x46.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-225x161.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_04-350x250.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-4058">Figure 2.15 Although their structures and functions differ, all polysaccharide carbohydrates are made up of monosaccharides and have the chemical formula (CH2O)n.</div></div> <div id="fs-idm10738384" class="career non-majors"><p id="fs-idp71341744">Registered Dietitian: Obesity is a worldwide health concern, and many diseases, such as diabetes and heart disease, are becoming more prevalent because of obesity. This is one of the reasons why registered dietitians are increasingly sought after for advice. Registered dietitians help plan food and nutrition programs for individuals in various settings. They often work with patients in health-care facilities, designing nutrition plans to prevent and treat diseases. For example, dietitians may teach a patient with diabetes how to manage blood-sugar levels by eating the correct types and amounts of carbohydrates. Dietitians may also work in nursing homes, schools, and private practices.</p> <p id="fs-idp54438384">To become a registered dietitian, one needs to earn at least a bachelor’s degree in dietetics, nutrition, food technology, or a related field. In addition, registered dietitians must complete a supervised internship program and pass a national exam. Those who pursue careers in dietetics take courses in nutrition, chemistry, biochemistry, biology, microbiology, and human physiology. Dietitians must become experts in the chemistry and functions of food (proteins, carbohydrates, and fats).</p> </div> <h5 class="career non-majors">Through the Indigenous Lens (Suzanne Wilkerson and Charles Molnar)</h5> <div class="career non-majors"><p>I work at Camosun College located in beautiful Victoria, British Columbia with campuses on the Traditional Territories of the Lekwungen and W̱SÁNEĆ peoples.

Some plants, like camas create inulin. Inulin is used as dietary fibre however, it is not readily digested by humans. If you were to bite into a raw camas bulb it would taste bitter and has a gummy texture. The method used by Indigenous peoples to make camas both digestible and tasty is to bake the bulbs slowly for a long period in an underground firepit covered with specific leaves and soil. The heat acts like our pancreatic amylase enzyme and breaks down the long chains of inulin into digestible mono and di-saccharides.</p> <p>Properly baked, the camas bulbs taste like a combination of baked pear and cooked fig. It is important to note that while the blue camas is a food source, it should not be confused with the white death camas, which is particularly toxic and deadly.

Lipids are hydrophobic (“water-fearing”), or insoluble in water, because they are nonpolar molecules. This is because they are hydrocarbons that include only nonpolar carbon-carbon or carbon-hydrogen bonds. Lipids perform many different functions in a cell. Cells store energy for long-term use in the form of lipids called <strong>fats</strong>. Lipids also provide insulation from the environment for plants and animals. For example, they help keep aquatic birds and mammals dry because of their water-repelling nature. Lipids are also the building blocks of many hormones and are an important constituent of the plasma membrane. Lipids include fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.11"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_66" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-66" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4358" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_05-300x2302-1.jpg" alt="A photo of a river otter in the water" width="400" height="307" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_05-300x2302-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_05-300x2302-1-65x50.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_05-300x2302-1-225x173.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-66">Figure 2.17 Hydrophobic lipids in the fur of aquatic mammals, such as this river otter, protect them from the elements.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp47068112">A fat molecule, such as a triglyceride, consists of two main components—glycerol and fatty acids. Glycerol is an organic compound with three carbon atoms, five hydrogen atoms, and three hydroxyl (–OH) groups. Fatty acids have a long chain of hydrocarbons to which an acidic carboxyl group is attached, hence the name “fatty acid.” The number of carbons in the fatty acid may range from 4 to 36; most common are those containing 12–18 carbons. In a fat molecule, a fatty acid is attached to each of the three oxygen atoms in the –OH groups of the glycerol molecule with a covalent bond.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.12"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_74" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-74" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4359" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062.jpg" alt="Chemical structures of starch, glycogen, cellulose, and chitin." width="600" height="486" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062.jpg 1119w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-300x243.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-1024x829.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-768x622.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-65x53.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-225x182.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_062-350x283.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-74">Figure 2.18 Lipids include fats, such as triglycerides, which are made up of fatty acids and glycerol, phospholipids, and steroids.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp74978384">During this covalent bond formation, three water molecules are released. The three fatty acids in the fat may be similar or dissimilar. These fats are also called <strong>triglycerides</strong> because they have three fatty acids. Some fatty acids have common names that specify their origin. For example, palmitic acid, a saturated fatty acid, is derived from the palm tree. Arachidic acid is derived from <em>Arachis hypogaea</em>, the scientific name for peanuts.</p> <p id="fs-idm20978208">Fatty acids may be saturated or unsaturated. In a fatty acid chain, if there are only single bonds between neighboring carbons in the hydrocarbon chain, the fatty acid is saturated. <strong>Saturated fatty acids</strong> are saturated with hydrogen; in other words, the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon skeleton is maximized.</p> <p id="fs-idp35457904">When the hydrocarbon chain contains a double bond, the fatty acid is an <strong>unsaturated fatty acid</strong>.</p> <p id="fs-idp55898064">Most unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature and are called <strong>oils</strong>. If there is one double bond in the molecule, then it is known as a monounsaturated fat (e.g., olive oil), and if there is more than one double bond, then it is known as a polyunsaturated fat (e.g., canola oil).</p> <p id="fs-idm38571712">Saturated fats tend to get packed tightly and are solid at room temperature. Animal fats with stearic acid and palmitic acid contained in meat, and the fat with butyric acid contained in butter, are examples of saturated fats. Mammals store fats in specialized cells called adipocytes, where globules of fat occupy most of the cell. In plants, fat or oil is stored in seeds and is used as a source of energy during embryonic development.</p> <p id="fs-idp47052848">Unsaturated fats or oils are usually of plant origin and contain unsaturated fatty acids. The double bond causes a bend or a “kink” that prevents the fatty acids from packing tightly, keeping them liquid at room temperature. Olive oil, corn oil, canola oil, and cod liver oil are examples of unsaturated fats. Unsaturated fats help to improve blood cholesterol levels, whereas saturated fats contribute to plaque formation in the arteries, which increases the risk of a heart attack.</p> <p id="fs-idp5132272">In the food industry, oils are artificially hydrogenated to make them semi-solid, leading to less spoilage and increased shelf life. Simply speaking, hydrogen gas is bubbled through oils to solidify them. During this hydrogenation process, double bonds of the <em>cis</em>-conformation in the hydrocarbon chain may be converted to double bonds in the <em>trans</em>-conformation. This forms a <strong><em>trans</em>-fat</strong> from a <em>cis</em>-fat. The orientation of the double bonds affects the chemical properties of the fat.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.13"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_68" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-68" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4360" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_07-300x2482-1.jpg" alt="Two images show the molecular structure of a fat in the cis-conformation and the trans-conformation." width="400" height="331" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_07-300x2482-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_07-300x2482-1-65x54.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_07-300x2482-1-225x186.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-68">Figure 2.19 During the hydrogenation process, the orientation around the double bonds is changed, making a trans-fat from a cis-fat.

Recent studies have shown that an increase in <em>trans</em>-fats in the human diet may lead to an increase in levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), or “bad” cholesterol, which, in turn, may lead to plaque deposition in the arteries, resulting in heart disease. Many fast food restaurants have recently eliminated the use of <em>trans</em>-fats, and U.S. food labels are now required to list their <em>trans</em>-fat content.</p> <p id="fs-idm54784640">Essential fatty acids are fatty acids that are required but not synthesized by the human body. Consequently, they must be supplemented through the diet. <strong>Omega-3 fatty acids</strong> fall into this category and are one of only two known essential fatty acids for humans (the other being omega-6 fatty acids). They are a type of polyunsaturated fat and are called omega-3 fatty acids because the third carbon from the end of the fatty acid participates in a double bond.</p> <p id="fs-idm55974896">Salmon, trout, and tuna are good sources of omega-3 fatty acids. Omega-3 fatty acids are important in brain function and normal growth and development. They may also prevent heart disease and reduce the risk of cancer.</p> <p id="fs-idm78146256">Like carbohydrates, fats have received a lot of bad publicity. It is true that eating an excess of fried foods and other “fatty” foods leads to weight gain. However, fats do have important functions. Fats serve as long-term energy storage. They also provide insulation for the body. Therefore, “healthy” unsaturated fats in moderate amounts should be consumed on a regular basis.</p> <p id="fs-idm52357584"><strong>Phospholipids</strong> are the major constituent of the plasma membrane. Like fats, they are composed of fatty acid chains attached to a glycerol or similar backbone. Instead of three fatty acids attached, however, there are two fatty acids and the third carbon of the glycerol backbone is bound to a phosphate group. The phosphate group is modified by the addition of an alcohol.</p> <p id="fs-idp83466720">A phospholipid has both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The fatty acid chains are hydrophobic and exclude themselves from water, whereas the phosphate is hydrophilic and interacts with water.</p> <p id="fs-idm55763424">Cells are surrounded by a membrane, which has a bilayer of phospholipids. The fatty acids of phospholipids face inside, away from water, whereas the phosphate group can face either the outside environment or the inside of the cell, which are both aqueous.</p> <h5>Through the Indigenous Lens</h5> <p>For the First peoples of the Pacific Northwest the fat rich fish ooligan, with 20% fat by body weight, was a crucial part of the diet of several First Nations. Why? Because fat is the most calorie dense food and having a storable, high calorie compact energy source would be important to survival. The nature of its fat also made it an important trade good. Like salmon, ooligan returns to its birth stream after years at sea. Its arrival in the early spring made it the first fresh food of the year. In the Tsimshianic languages the arrival of the ooligan … was traditionally announced with the cry, ‘Hlaa aat’ixshi halimootxw!’ … meaning ‘Our Saviour has just arrived!’</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_4361" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4361" style="width: 300px"><img class="wp-image-4361 size-medium" title="Figure 2.20 Image of cooked ooligan.

Ooligan fat composition is 30% saturated fat (like butter) and 55% monounsaturated fat (like plant oils). Importantly it is a solid grease at room temperature. Because it is low in polyunsaturated fats (which oxidize and spoil quickly) it can be stored for later use and used as a trade item. Its composition is said to make it as healthy as olive oil, or better as it has omega 3 fatty acids that reduce risk for diabetes and stroke. It also is rich in three fat soluble vitamins A, E and K.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm81694480"><h2>Steroids and Waxes</h2> <p id="fs-idm51430352">Unlike the phospholipids and fats discussed earlier, <strong>steroids</strong> have a ring structure. Although they do not resemble other lipids, they are grouped with them because they are also hydrophobic. All steroids have four, linked carbon rings and several of them, like cholesterol, have a short tail.</p> <p id="fs-idm127618976">Cholesterol is a steroid. Cholesterol is mainly synthesized in the liver and is the precursor of many steroid hormones, such as testosterone and estradiol. It is also the precursor of vitamins E and K. Cholesterol is the precursor of bile salts, which help in the breakdown of fats and their subsequent absorption by cells. Although cholesterol is often spoken of in negative terms, it is necessary for the proper functioning of the body. It is a key component of the plasma membranes of animal cells.</p> <p id="fs-idp33877296">Waxes are made up of a hydrocarbon chain with an alcohol (–OH) group and a fatty acid. Examples of animal waxes include beeswax and lanolin. Plants also have waxes, such as the coating on their leaves, that helps prevent them from drying out.</p> <div id="fs-idm18031456" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="eip-idp82240224"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/lipids2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idm71715008">For an additional perspective on lipids, explore “Biomolecules: The Lipids” through this interactive <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lipids" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/lipids">animation</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp8690560"><h1>Proteins</h1> <p id="fs-idm56053456"><strong>Proteins </strong>are one of the most abundant organic molecules in living systems and have the most diverse range of functions of all macromolecules. Proteins may be structural, regulatory, contractile, or protective; they may serve in transport, storage, or membranes; or they may be toxins or enzymes. Each cell in a living system may contain thousands of different proteins, each with a unique function. Their structures, like their functions, vary greatly. They are all, however, polymers of amino acids, arranged in a linear sequence.</p> <p id="fs-idm21451136">The functions of proteins are very diverse because there are 20 different chemically distinct amino acids that form long chains, and the amino acids can be in any order. For example, proteins can function as enzymes or hormones. <strong>Enzymes</strong>, which are produced by living cells, are catalysts in biochemical reactions (like digestion) and are usually proteins. Each enzyme is specific for the substrate (a reactant that binds to an enzyme) upon which it acts. Enzymes can function to break molecular bonds, to rearrange bonds, or to form new bonds. An example of an enzyme is salivary amylase, which breaks down amylose, a component of starch.</p> <p id="fs-idm21032352"><strong>Hormones </strong>are chemical signaling molecules, usually proteins or steroids, secreted by an endocrine gland or group of endocrine cells that act to control or regulate specific physiological processes, including growth, development, metabolism, and reproduction. For example, insulin is a protein hormone that maintains blood glucose levels.</p> <p id="fs-idp43975344">Proteins have different shapes and molecular weights; some proteins are globular in shape whereas others are fibrous in nature. For example, hemoglobin is a globular protein, but collagen, found in our skin, is a fibrous protein. Protein shape is critical to its function. Changes in temperature, pH, and exposure to chemicals may lead to permanent changes in the shape of the protein, leading to a loss of function or denaturation (to be discussed in more detail later). All proteins are made up of different arrangements of the same 20 kinds of amino acids.</p> <p id="fs-idm24780384"><strong>Amino acids </strong>are the monomers that make up proteins. Each amino acid has the same fundamental structure, which consists of a central carbon atom bonded to an amino group (–NH<sub>2</sub>), a carboxyl group (–COOH), and a hydrogen atom. Every amino acid also has another variable atom or group of atoms bonded to the central carbon atom known as the R group. The R group is the only difference in structure between the 20 amino acids; otherwise, the amino acids are identical.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_77" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-77" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_08.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_08.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4363" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_082.jpg" alt="The fundamental molecular structure of an amino acid is shown.

The central carbon’s fourth bond varies among the different amino acids, as seen in these examples of alanine, valine, lysine, and aspartic acid.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp59830768">The chemical nature of the R group determines the chemical nature of the amino acid within its protein (that is, whether it is acidic, basic, polar, or nonpolar).</p> <p id="fs-idp8665520">The sequence and number of amino acids ultimately determine a protein’s shape, size, and function. Each amino acid is attached to another amino acid by a covalent bond, known as a peptide bond, which is formed by a dehydration reaction. The carboxyl group of one amino acid and the amino group of a second amino acid combine, releasing a water molecule. The resulting bond is the peptide bond.</p> <p id="fs-idp963792">The products formed by such a linkage are called <strong>polypeptides</strong>. While the terms polypeptide and protein are sometimes used interchangeably, a polypeptide is technically a polymer of amino acids, whereas the term protein is used for a polypeptide or polypeptides that have combined together, have a distinct shape, and have a unique function.</p> <div id="fs-idm65366912" class="evolution non-majors"><h2>Evolution in Action</h2> <p id="fs-idp46752224">The Evolutionary Significance of Cytochrome cCytochrome c is an important component of the molecular machinery that harvests energy from glucose. Because this protein’s role in producing cellular energy is crucial, it has changed very little over millions of years. Protein sequencing has shown that there is a considerable amount of sequence similarity among cytochrome c molecules of different species; evolutionary relationships can be assessed by measuring the similarities or differences among various species’ protein sequences.</p> <p id="fs-idp34546400">For example, scientists have determined that human cytochrome c contains 104 amino acids. For each cytochrome c molecule that has been sequenced to date from different organisms, 37 of these amino acids appear in the same position in each cytochrome c. This indicates that all of these organisms are descended from a common ancestor. On comparing the human and chimpanzee protein sequences, no sequence difference was found. When human and rhesus monkey sequences were compared, a single difference was found in one amino acid. In contrast, human-to-yeast comparisons show a difference in 44 amino acids, suggesting that humans and chimpanzees have a more recent common ancestor than humans and the rhesus monkey, or humans and yeast.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm18002832"><h2>Protein Structure</h2> <p id="fs-idm15092592">As discussed earlier, the shape of a protein is critical to its function. To understand how the protein gets its final shape or conformation, we need to understand the four levels of protein structure: <strong>primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary</strong>.</p> <p id="fs-idm52007456">The unique sequence and number of amino acids in a polypeptide chain is its primary structure. The unique sequence for every protein is ultimately determined by the gene that encodes the protein. Any change in the gene sequence may lead to a different amino acid being added to the polypeptide chain, causing a change in protein structure and function. In sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin β chain has a single amino acid substitution, causing a change in both the structure and function of the protein. What is most remarkable to consider is that a hemoglobin molecule is made up of two alpha chains and two beta chains that each consist of about 150 amino acids. The molecule, therefore, has about 600 amino acids. The structural difference between a normal hemoglobin molecule and a sickle cell molecule—that dramatically decreases life expectancy in the affected individuals—is a single amino acid of the 600.</p> <p id="fs-idp73555264">Because of this change of one amino acid in the chain, the normally biconcave, or disc-shaped, red blood cells assume a crescent or “sickle” shape, which clogs arteries. This can lead to a myriad of serious health problems, such as breathlessness, dizziness, headaches, and abdominal pain for those who have this disease.</p> <p id="fs-idm35625488">Folding patterns resulting from interactions between the non-R group portions of amino acids give rise to the secondary structure of the protein. The most common are the alpha (α)-helix and beta (β)-pleated sheet structures. Both structures are held in shape by hydrogen bonds. In the alpha helix, the bonds form between every fourth amino acid and cause a twist in the amino acid chain.</p> <p id="fs-idm19429680">In the β-pleated sheet, the “pleats” are formed by hydrogen bonding between atoms on the backbone of the polypeptide chain. The R groups are attached to the carbons, and extend above and below the folds of the pleat. The pleated segments align parallel to each other, and hydrogen bonds form between the same pairs of atoms on each of the aligned amino acids. The α-helix and β-pleated sheet structures are found in many globular and fibrous proteins.</p> <p id="fs-idp14932864">The unique three-dimensional structure of a polypeptide is known as its tertiary structure. This structure is caused by chemical interactions between various amino acids and regions of the polypeptide. Primarily, the interactions among R groups create the complex three-dimensional tertiary structure of a protein. There may be ionic bonds formed between R groups on different amino acids, or hydrogen bonding beyond that involved in the secondary structure. When protein folding takes place, the hydrophobic R groups of nonpolar amino acids lay in the interior of the protein, whereas the hydrophilic R groups lay on the outside. The former types of interactions are also known as hydrophobic interactions.</p> <p id="fs-idp84269776">In nature, some proteins are formed from several polypeptides, also known as subunits, and the interaction of these subunits forms the quaternary structure. Weak interactions between the subunits help to stabilize the overall structure. For example, hemoglobin is a combination of four polypeptide subunits.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure2.15"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_71" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-71" style="width: 376px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_09.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_02_03_09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4364" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_09-769x10242-1.jpg" alt="Figure_02_03_09" width="376" height="500" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_09-769x10242-1.jpg 769w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_09-769x10242-1-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_09-769x10242-1-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_02_03_09-769x10242-1-350x466.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-71">Figure 2.22 The four levels of protein structure can be observed in these illustrations.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm54908400">Each protein has its own unique sequence and shape held together by chemical interactions. If the protein is subject to changes in temperature, pH, or exposure to chemicals, the protein structure may change, losing its shape in what is known as <strong>denaturation</strong> as discussed earlier. Denaturation is often reversible because the primary structure is preserved if the denaturing agent is removed, allowing the protein to resume its function. Sometimes denaturation is irreversible, leading to a loss of function. One example of protein denaturation can be seen when an egg is fried or boiled. The albumin protein in the liquid egg white is denatured when placed in a hot pan, changing from a clear substance to an opaque white substance. Not all proteins are denatured at high temperatures; for instance, bacteria that survive in hot springs have proteins that are adapted to function at those temperatures.</p> <div id="fs-idm76093712" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <h2><span id="eip-idp96714944"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/proteins2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></h2> <p id="fs-idp14302288">For an additional perspective on proteins, explore “Biomolecules: The Proteins” through this interactive <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/proteins">animation</a>.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp46685792"><h1>Nucleic Acids</h1> <p id="fs-idp81751552"><strong>Nucleic acids</strong> are key macromolecules in the continuity of life.

Carbohydrates are a group of macromolecules that are a vital energy source for the cell, provide structural support to many organisms, and can be found on the surface of the cell as receptors or for cell recognition. Carbohydrates are classified as monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides, depending on the number of monomers in the molecule.</p> <p id="fs-idm51315280">Lipids are a class of macromolecules that are nonpolar and hydrophobic in nature. Major types include fats and oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids. Fats and oils are a stored form of energy and can include triglycerides. Fats and oils are usually made up of fatty acids and glycerol.</p> <p id="fs-idm12137552">Proteins are a class of macromolecules that can perform a diverse range of functions for the cell. They help in metabolism by providing structural support and by acting as enzymes, carriers or as hormones. The building blocks of proteins are amino acids. Proteins are organized at four levels: primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary. Protein shape and function are intricately linked; any change in shape caused by changes in temperature, pH, or chemical exposure may lead to protein denaturation and a loss of function.</p> <p>Nucleic acids are molecules made up of repeating units of nucleotides that direct cellular activities such as cell division and protein synthesis.

A living thing, like you, is called an organism. Thus, cells are the basic building blocks of all organisms.</p> <p id="fs-idp93782784">In multicellular organisms, several cells of one particular kind interconnect with each other and perform shared functions to form tissues (for example, muscle tissue, connective tissue, and nervous tissue), several tissues combine to form an organ (for example, stomach, heart, or brain), and several organs make up an organ system (such as the digestive system, circulatory system, or nervous system). Several systems functioning together form an organism (such as an elephant, for example).</p> <p id="fs-idp113134400">There are many types of cells, and all are grouped into one of two broad categories: prokaryotic and eukaryotic. Animal cells, plant cells, fungal cells, and protist cells are classified as eukaryotic, whereas bacteria and archaea cells are classified as prokaryotic. Before discussing the criteria for determining whether a cell is prokaryotic or eukaryotic, let us first examine how biologists study cells.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp18125392"><h1>Microscopy</h1> <p id="fs-idp18948384">Cells vary in size. With few exceptions, individual cells are too small to be seen with the naked eye, so scientists use microscopes to study them. A <strong>microscope </strong>is an instrument that magnifies an object. Most images of cells are taken with a microscope and are called micrographs.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm16637120"><h2>Light Microscopes</h2> <p id="fs-idp7201152">To give you a sense of the size of a cell, a typical human red blood cell is about eight millionths of a meter or eight micrometers (abbreviated as µm) in diameter; the head of a pin is about two thousandths of a meter (millimeters, or mm) in diameter. That means that approximately 250 red blood cells could fit on the head of a pin.</p> <p id="fs-idp36203632">The optics of the lenses of a light microscope changes the orientation of the image. A specimen that is right-side up and facing right on the microscope slide will appear upside-down and facing left when viewed through a microscope, and vice versa. Similarly, if the slide is moved left while looking through the microscope, it will appear to move right, and if moved down, it will seem to move up. This occurs because microscopes use two sets of lenses to magnify the image. Due to the manner in which light travels through the lenses, this system of lenses produces an inverted image (binoculars and a dissecting microscope work in a similar manner, but include an additional magnification system that makes the final image appear to be upright).</p> <p id="fs-idp22247296">Most student microscopes are classified as light microscopes (Figure 3.2&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>). Visible light both passes through and is bent by the lens system to enable the user to see the specimen. Light microscopes are advantageous for viewing living organisms, but since individual cells are generally transparent, their components are not distinguishable unless they are colored with special stains. Staining, however, usually kills the cells.</p> <p id="fs-idp108612400">Light microscopes commonly used in the undergraduate college laboratory magnify up to approximately 400 times. Two parameters that are important in microscopy are magnification and resolving power. Magnification is the degree of enlargement of an object. Resolving power is the ability of a microscope to allow the eye to distinguish two adjacent structures as separate; the higher the resolution, the closer those two objects can be, and the better the clarity and detail of the image. When oil immersion lenses are used, magnification is usually increased to 1,000 times for the study of smaller cells, like most prokaryotic cells. Because light entering a specimen from below is focused onto the eye of an observer, the specimen can be viewed using light microscopy. For this reason, for light to pass through a specimen, the sample must be thin or translucent.</p> <div id="fs-idp118198192" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <h2><span id="fs-idp14075072"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/cell_sizes22.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></h2> <p id="fs-idm15412240">For another perspective on cell size, try the <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cell_sizes2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/cell_sizes2">HowBig</a> interactive.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idp263638992">A second type of microscope used in laboratories is the dissecting microscope (Figure 3.2&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>). These microscopes have a lower magnification (20 to 80 times the object size) than light microscopes and can provide a three-dimensional view of the specimen. Thick objects can be examined with many components in focus at the same time. These microscopes are designed to give a magnified and clear view of tissue structure as well as the anatomy of the whole organism. Like light microscopes, most modern dissecting microscopes are also binocular, meaning that they have two separate lens systems, one for each eye. The lens systems are separated by a certain distance, and therefore provide a sense of depth in the view of their subject to make manipulations by hand easier. Dissecting microscopes also have optics that correct the image so that it appears as if being seen by the naked eye and not as an inverted image. The light illuminating a sample under a dissecting microscope typically comes from above the sample, but may also be directed from below.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure3.2"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_79" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-79" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_01ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_01ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4374" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_01ab-1024x6002-1.jpg" alt="Part a: This light microscope has binocular lenses and three objective lenses.

(b) Dissecting microscopes have a lower magnification than light microscopes and are used to examine larger objects, such as tissues.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp18287472"><h2>Electron Microscopes</h2> <p id="fs-idm26675952">In contrast to light microscopes, electron microscopes use a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light. Not only does this allow for higher magnification and, thus, more detail (Figure 3.4), it also provides higher resolving power. Preparation of a specimen for viewing under an electron microscope will kill it; therefore, live cells cannot be viewed using this type of microscopy. In addition, the electron beam moves best in a vacuum, making it impossible to view living materials.</p> <p id="fs-idp18126736">In a scanning electron microscope, a beam of electrons moves back and forth across a cell’s surface, rendering the details of cell surface characteristics by reflection. Cells and other structures are usually coated with a metal like gold. In a transmission electron microscope, the electron beam is transmitted through the cell and provides details of a cell’s internal structures. As you might imagine, electron microscopes are significantly more bulky and expensive than are light microscopes.</p> <div class="" id="figure3.3"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-80" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_02a_new.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_02a_new.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4375" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2.jpg" alt="Part a: Salmonella viewed through a light microscope appear as tiny purple dots." width="400" height="304" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2-300x228.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2-225x171.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02a_new2-350x266.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 3.3 Salmonella bacteria are viewed with a light microscope.</div></div> </div> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure3.4"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-81" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_02b_new.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_01_02b_new.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4376" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_01_02b_new-300x2282-1.jpg" alt="Part b: In this scanning electron micrograph, the bacteria appear as three-dimensional red ovals.

Despite the limitations of his now-ancient lenses, van Leeuwenhoek observed the movements of protists (a type of single-celled organism) and sperm, which he collectively termed “animalcules.”</p> <p id="fs-idm27163376">In a 1665 publication called <em>Micrographia</em>, experimental scientist Robert Hooke coined the term “cell” (from the Latin <em>cella</em>, meaning “small room”) for the box-like structures he observed when viewing cork tissue through a lens.

The cell wall acts as an extra layer of protection, helps the cell maintain its shape, and prevents dehydration. The capsule enables the cell to attach to surfaces in its environment. Some prokaryotes have flagella, pili, or fimbriae. Flagella are used for locomotion, while most pili are used to exchange genetic material during a type of reproduction called conjugation.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm89398288"><h1>Eukaryotic Cells</h1> <p id="fs-idp23469392">In nature, the relationship between form and function is apparent at all levels, including the level of the cell, and this will become clear as we explore eukaryotic cells. The principle “form follows function” is found in many contexts. For example, birds and fish have streamlined bodies that allow them to move quickly through the medium in which they live, be it air or water. It means that, in general, one can deduce the function of a structure by looking at its form, because the two are matched.</p> <p id="fs-idp2533216">A eukaryotic cell is a cell that <strong>has a membrane-bound nucleus and other membrane-bound compartments or sacs, called organelles</strong>, which have specialized functions. The word eukaryotic means “true kernel” or “true nucleus,” alluding to the presence of the membrane-bound nucleus in these cells. The word “organelle” means “little organ,” and, as already mentioned, organelles have specialized cellular functions, just as the organs of your body have specialized functions.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm74911904"><h1>Cell Size</h1> <p id="fs-idp19230784">At 0.1–5.0 µm in diameter, prokaryotic cells are significantly smaller than eukaryotic cells, which have diameters ranging from 10–100 µm (Figure 3.7). The small size of prokaryotes allows ions and organic molecules that enter them to quickly spread to other parts of the cell. Similarly, any wastes produced within a prokaryotic cell can quickly move out. However, larger eukaryotic cells have evolved different structural adaptations to enhance cellular transport. Indeed, the large size of these cells would not be possible without these adaptations. In general, <strong>cell size is limited </strong>because volume increases much more quickly than does cell surface area. As a cell becomes larger, it becomes more and more difficult for the cell to acquire sufficient materials to support the processes inside the cell, because the relative size of the surface area across which materials must be transported declines.</p> <div class="" id="figure3.7"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_85" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-85" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4381" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_02_022.jpg" alt="Relative sizes on a logarithmic scale, from 0.1 nm to 1 m, are shown.

The fluid inside the cell is called the cytoplasm, and the cell is surrounded by a cell membrane. The nucleus takes up about one-half of the width of the cell. Inside the nucleus is the chromatin, which is comprised of DNA and associated proteins. A region of the chromatin is condensed into the nucleolus, a structure in which ribosomes are synthesized. The nucleus is encased in a nuclear envelope, which is perforated by protein-lined pores that allow entry of material into the nucleus. The nucleus is surrounded by the rough and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, or ER. The smooth ER is the site of lipid synthesis. The rough ER has embedded ribosomes that give it a bumpy appearance. It synthesizes membrane and secretory proteins. Besides the ER, many other organelles float inside the cytoplasm. These include the Golgi apparatus, which modifies proteins and lipids synthesized in the ER. The Golgi apparatus is made of layers of flat membranes. Mitochondria, which produce energy for the cell, have an outer membrane and a highly folded inner membrane. Other, smaller organelles include peroxisomes that metabolize waste, lysosomes that digest food, and vacuoles. Ribosomes, responsible for protein synthesis, also float freely in the cytoplasm and are depicted as small dots. The last cellular component shown is the cytoskeleton, which has four different types of components: microfilaments, intermediate filaments, microtubules, and centrosomes. Microfilaments are fibrous proteins that line the cell membrane and make up the cellular cortex. Intermediate filaments are fibrous proteins that hold organelles in place. Microtubules form the mitotic spindle and maintain cell shape. Centrosomes are made of two tubular structures at right angles to one another. They form the microtubule-organizing center.Figure_03_03_01a_new" width="400" height="478" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_03_01a_new2.png 519w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_03_01a_new2-251x300.png 251w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_03_01a_new2-65x78.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_03_01a_new2-225x269.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_03_01a_new2-350x418.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-87">Figure 3.8 (a) This figure shows a typical animal cell</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fs-idm76120544"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_88" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-88" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_01b_new.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_01b_new.png"><img class="wp-image-4385 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_01b_new-e14271308647052.png" alt="Part b: This illustration depicts a typical eukaryotic plant cell.

The plant cell has three of the four cytoskeletal components found in animal cells: microtubules, intermediate filaments, and microfilaments. Plant cells do not have centrosomes. Plants have five structures not found in animals cells: plasmodesmata, chloroplasts, plastids, a central vacuole, and a cell wall. Plasmodesmata form channels between adjacent plant cells. Chloroplasts are responsible for photosynthesis; they have an outer membrane, an inner membrane, and stack of membranes inside the inner membrane.

It is made up of organelles suspended in the gel-like cytosol, the cytoskeleton, and various chemicals. Even though the cytoplasm consists of 70 to 80 percent water, it has a semi-solid consistency, which comes from the proteins within it. However, proteins are not the only organic molecules found in the cytoplasm. Glucose and other simple sugars, polysaccharides, amino acids, nucleic acids, fatty acids, and derivatives of glycerol are found there too. Ions of sodium, potassium, calcium, and many other elements are also dissolved in the cytoplasm.

They also maintain the structure of microvilli, the extensive folding of the plasma membrane found in cells dedicated to absorption. These components are also common in muscle cells and are responsible for muscle cell contraction. Intermediate filaments are of intermediate diameter and have structural functions, such as maintaining the shape of the cell and anchoring organelles. Keratin, the compound that strengthens hair and nails, forms one type of intermediate filament. Microtubules are the thickest of the cytoskeletal fibers. These are hollow tubes that can dissolve and reform quickly. Microtubules guide organelle movement and are the structures that pull chromosomes to their poles during cell division. They are also the structural components of flagella and cilia. In cilia and flagella, the microtubules are organized as a circle of nine double microtubules on the outside and two microtubules in the center.</p> <p id="fs-idm1366112">The centrosome is a region near the nucleus of animal cells that functions as a microtubule-organizing center. It contains a pair of centrioles, two structures that lie perpendicular to each other. Each centriole is a cylinder of nine triplets of microtubules.</p> <p id="fs-idp182939536">The centrosome replicates itself before a cell divides, and the centrioles play a role in pulling the duplicated chromosomes to opposite ends of the dividing cell. However, the exact function of the centrioles in cell division is not clear, since cells that have the centrioles removed can still divide, and plant cells, which lack centrioles, are capable of cell division.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp84576176"><h2>Flagella and Cilia</h2> <p id="fs-idp115403344">Flagella (singular = flagellum) are long, hair-like structures that extend from the plasma membrane and are used to move an entire cell, (for example, sperm, <em>Euglena</em>). When present, the cell has just one flagellum or a few flagella. When cilia (singular = cilium) are present, however, they are many in number and extend along the entire surface of the plasma membrane. They are short, hair-like structures that are used to move entire cells (such as paramecium) or move substances along the outer surface of the cell (for example, the cilia of cells lining the fallopian tubes that move the ovum toward the uterus, or cilia lining the cells of the respiratory tract that move particulate matter toward the throat that mucus has trapped).</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm54847856"><h1>The Endomembrane System</h1> <p id="fs-idp135494832">The endomembrane system (<em>endo</em> = within) is a <strong>group of membranes and organelles in eukaryotic cells that work together to modify, package, and transport lipids and proteins</strong>. It includes the nuclear envelope, lysosomes, vesicles, endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus, which we will cover shortly.

For example, in humans, the chromosome number is 46, whereas in fruit flies, the chromosome number is eight.</p> <p id="fs-idp41267872">Chromosomes are only visible and distinguishable from one another when the cell is getting ready to divide. When the cell is in the growth and maintenance phases of its life cycle, the chromosomes resemble an unwound, jumbled bunch of threads.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_823" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-823" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_04_03_05a.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_04_03_05a.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4389" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05a-300x2942-1.jpg" alt="This image shows various levels of the organization of chromatin (DNA and protein)." width="300" height="294" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05a-300x2942-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05a-300x2942-1-65x64.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05a-300x2942-1-225x221.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-823">Figure 3.12 This image shows various levels of the organization of chromatin (DNA and protein).</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_824" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-824" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_04_03_05b.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_04_03_05b.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4390" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05b-300x2922-1.jpg" alt="This image shows paired chromosomes" width="300" height="292" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05b-300x2922-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05b-300x2922-1-65x63.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_05b-300x2922-1-225x219.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-824">Figure 3.13 This image shows paired chromosomes. (credit: modification of work by NIH; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)</div></div> <p id="fs-idp130648528">We already know that the nucleus directs the synthesis of ribosomes, but how does it do this? Some chromosomes have sections of DNA that encode ribosomal RNA. A darkly stained area within the nucleus, called the <strong>nucleolus (plural = nucleoli</strong>), aggregates the ribosomal RNA with associated proteins to assemble the ribosomal subunits that are then transported through the nuclear pores into the cytoplasm.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp100041920"><h2>The Endoplasmic Reticulum</h2> <p id="fs-idp96833712">The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a series of interconnected membranous tubules that collectively modify proteins and synthesize lipids. However, these two functions are performed in separate areas of the endoplasmic reticulum: the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, respectively.</p> <p id="fs-idp95624608">The hollow portion of the ER tubules is called the lumen or cisternal space. The membrane of the ER, which is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins, is continuous with the nuclear envelope.</p> <p id="fs-idp46615216">The <strong>rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER)</strong> is so named because the ribosomes attached to its cytoplasmic surface give it a studded appearance when viewed through an electron microscope.</p> <p id="fs-idp19844384">The ribosomes synthesize proteins while attached to the ER, resulting in the transfer of their newly synthesized proteins into the lumen of the RER where they undergo modifications such as folding or addition of sugars. The RER also makes phospholipids for cell membranes.</p> <p id="fs-idp166161920">If the phospholipids or modified proteins are not destined to stay in the RER, they will be packaged within vesicles and transported from the RER by budding from the membrane. Since the RER is engaged in modifying proteins that will be secreted from the cell, it is abundant in cells that secrete proteins, such as the liver.</p> <p id="fs-idp52297536">The <strong>smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER)</strong> is continuous with the RER but has few or no ribosomes on its cytoplasmic surface. The SER’s functions include synthesis of carbohydrates, lipids (including phospholipids), and steroid hormones; detoxification of medications and poisons; alcohol metabolism; and storage of calcium ions.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp54178896"><h2>The Golgi Apparatus</h2> <p id="fs-idp38567280">We have already mentioned that vesicles can bud from the ER, but where do the vesicles go? Before reaching their final destination, the lipids or proteins within the transport vesicles need to be sorted, packaged, and tagged so that they wind up in the right place. The <strong>sorting, tagging, packaging, and distribution of lipids and proteins</strong> take place in the Golgi apparatus (also called the Golgi body), a series of flattened membranous sacs.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_92" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_06_new.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_06_new.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4391" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2.jpg" alt="In this transmission electron micrograph, the Golgi apparatus appears as a stack of membranes surrounded by unnamed organelles." width="400" height="201" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2-300x151.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2-65x33.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2-225x113.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_06_new2-350x176.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-92">Figure 3.14 The Golgi apparatus in this transmission electron micrograph of a white blood cell is visible as a stack of semicircular flattened rings in the lower portion of this image. Several vesicles can be seen near the Golgi apparatus. (credit: modification of work by Louisa Howard; scale-bar data from Matt Russell)</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp53068400">The Golgi apparatus has a receiving face near the endoplasmic reticulum and a releasing face on the side away from the ER, toward the cell membrane. The transport vesicles that form from the ER travel to the receiving face, fuse with it, and empty their contents into the lumen of the Golgi apparatus. As the proteins and lipids travel through the Golgi, they undergo further modifications. The most frequent modification is the addition of short chains of sugar molecules. The newly modified proteins and lipids are then tagged with small molecular groups to enable them to be routed to their proper destinations.</p> <p id="fs-idp32348592">Finally, the modified and tagged proteins are packaged into vesicles that bud from the opposite face of the Golgi. While some of these vesicles, transport vesicles, deposit their contents into other parts of the cell where they will be used, others, secretory vesicles, fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents outside the cell.</p> <p id="fs-idp84996272">The amount of Golgi in different cell types again illustrates that form follows function within cells. Cells that engage in a great deal of secretory activity (such as cells of the salivary glands that secrete digestive enzymes or cells of the immune system that secrete antibodies) have an abundant number of Golgi.</p> <p id="fs-idp92416528">In plant cells, the Golgi has an additional role of synthesizing polysaccharides, some of which are incorporated into the cell wall and some of which are used in other parts of the cell.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp23189584"><h2>Lysosomes</h2> <p id="fs-idp40076928">In animal cells, the lysosomes are the cell’s <strong>“garbage disposal.”</strong> Digestive enzymes within the lysosomes aid the breakdown of proteins, polysaccharides, lipids, nucleic acids, and even worn-out organelles. In single-celled eukaryotes, lysosomes are important for digestion of the food they ingest and the <strong>recycling of organelles</strong>. These enzymes are active at a much lower pH (more acidic) than those located in the cytoplasm. Many reactions that take place in the cytoplasm could not occur at a low pH, thus the advantage of compartmentalizing the eukaryotic cell into organelles is apparent.</p> <p id="fs-idp48293552">Lysosomes also use their hydrolytic enzymes to destroy disease-causing organisms that might enter the cell. A good example of this occurs in a group of white blood cells called macrophages, which are part of your body’s immune system. In a process known as phagocytosis, a section of the plasma membrane of the macrophage invaginates (folds in) and engulfs a pathogen. The invaginated section, with the pathogen inside, then pinches itself off from the plasma membrane and becomes a vesicle. The vesicle fuses with a lysosome. The lysosome’s hydrolytic enzymes then destroy the pathogen (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch03_03_07" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-3-eukaryotic-cells/#fig-ch03_03_07">Figure 3.15</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch03_03_07"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_93" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_03_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4392" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_03_07-300x1752-1.jpg" alt="In this illustration, a eukaryotic cell is shown consuming a bacterium.

A byproduct of these oxidation reactions is hydrogen peroxide, H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, which is contained within the peroxisomes to prevent the chemical from causing damage to cellular components outside of the organelle.

The cell wall is a rigid covering that protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Fungal and protist cells also have cell walls.</p> <p id="fs-idp96698608">While the chief component of prokaryotic cell walls is peptidoglycan, the major organic molecule in the plant cell wall is cellulose, a polysaccharide made up of long, straight chains of glucose units.

Have you wondered why? Strong evidence points to endosymbiosis as the explanation.</p> <p id="fs-idp2812752">Symbiosis is a relationship in which organisms from two separate species live in close association and typically exhibit specific adaptations to each other. Endosymbiosis (<em>endo-</em>= within) is a relationship in which one organism lives inside the other. Endosymbiotic relationships abound in nature. Microbes that produce vitamin K live inside the human gut. This relationship is beneficial for us because we are unable to synthesize vitamin K. It is also beneficial for the microbes because they are protected from other organisms and are provided a stable habitat and abundant food by living within the large intestine.</p> <p id="fs-idm385840">Scientists have long noticed that bacteria, mitochondria, and chloroplasts are similar in size. We also know that mitochondria and chloroplasts have DNA and ribosomes, just as bacteria do and they resemble the types found in bacteria. Scientists believe that host cells and bacteria formed a mutually beneficial endosymbiotic relationship when the host cells ingested aerobic bacteria and cyanobacteria but did not destroy them. Through evolution, these ingested bacteria became more specialized in their functions, with the aerobic bacteria becoming mitochondria and the photosynthetic bacteria becoming chloroplasts.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp52490432"><h2>The Central Vacuole</h2> <p id="fs-idp92888608">Previously, we mentioned vacuoles as essential components of plant cells. If you look at <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch03_03_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-3-eukaryotic-cells/#fig-ch03_03_01">Figure 3.8</a>&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>, you will see that plant cells each have a large, central vacuole that occupies most of the cell. The central vacuole plays a key role in regulating the cell’s concentration of water in changing environmental conditions. In plant cells, the liquid inside the central vacuole provides turgor pressure, which is the outward pressure caused by the fluid inside the cell. Have you ever noticed that if you forget to water a plant for a few days, it wilts? That is because as the water concentration in the soil becomes lower than the water concentration in the plant, water moves out of the central vacuoles and cytoplasm and into the soil. As the central vacuole shrinks, it leaves the cell wall unsupported. This loss of support to the cell walls of a plant results in the wilted appearance. Additionally, this fluid has a very bitter taste, which discourages consumption by insects and animals. The central vacuole also functions to store proteins in developing seed cells.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm15353488"><h1>Extracellular Matrix of Animal Cells</h1> <p id="fs-idm6262368">Most animal cells release materials into the extracellular space.

The plasma membrane is a phospholipid bilayer embedded with proteins. The nucleolus within the nucleus is the site for ribosome assembly. Ribosomes are found in the cytoplasm or are attached to the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane or endoplasmic reticulum. They perform protein synthesis. Mitochondria perform cellular respiration and produce ATP. Peroxisomes break down fatty acids, amino acids, and some toxins. Vesicles and vacuoles are storage and transport compartments. In plant cells, vacuoles also help break down macromolecules.</p> <p id="fs-idp39780656">Animal cells also have a centrosome and lysosomes. The centrosome has two bodies, the centrioles, with an unknown role in cell division. Lysosomes are the digestive organelles of animal cells.</p> <p id="fs-idp120895856">Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts, and a central vacuole. The plant cell wall, whose primary component is cellulose, protects the cell, provides structural support, and gives shape to the cell. Photosynthesis takes place in chloroplasts. The central vacuole expands, enlarging the cell without the need to produce more cytoplasm.</p> <p id="fs-idp34186240">The endomembrane system includes the nuclear envelope, the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, vesicles, as well as the plasma membrane. These cellular components work together to modify, package, tag, and transport membrane lipids and proteins.</p> <p id="fs-idp48233952">The cytoskeleton has three different types of protein elements. Microfilaments provide rigidity and shape to the cell, and facilitate cellular movements. Intermediate filaments bear tension and anchor the nucleus and other organelles in place. Microtubules help the cell resist compression, serve as tracks for motor proteins that move vesicles through the cell, and pull replicated chromosomes to opposite ends of a dividing cell. They are also the structural elements of centrioles, flagella, and cilia.</p> <p>Animal cells communicate through their extracellular matrices and are connected to each other by tight junctions, desmosomes, and gap junctions.

Cells exclude some substances, take in others, and excrete still others, all in controlled quantities. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux. The plasma membrane must be sufficiently flexible to allow certain cells, such as red blood cells and white blood cells, to change shape as they pass through narrow capillaries. These are the more obvious functions of a plasma membrane. In addition, the surface of the plasma membrane carries markers that allow cells to recognize one another, which is vital as tissues and organs form during early development, and which later plays a role in the “self” versus “non-self” distinction of the immune response.</p> <p id="fs-idm88370016">The plasma membrane also carries receptors, which are attachment sites for specific substances that interact with the cell. Each receptor is structured to bind with a specific substance. For example, surface receptors of the membrane create changes in the interior, such as changes in enzymes of metabolic pathways. These metabolic pathways might be vital for providing the cell with energy, making specific substances for the cell, or breaking down cellular waste or toxins for disposal. Receptors on the plasma membrane’s exterior surface interact with hormones or neurotransmitters, and allow their messages to be transmitted into the cell. Some recognition sites are used by viruses as attachment points. Although they are highly specific, pathogens like viruses may evolve to exploit receptors to gain entry to a cell by mimicking the specific substance that the receptor is meant to bind. This specificity helps to explain why human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or any of the five types of hepatitis viruses invade only specific cells.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp98596400"><h1>Fluid Mosaic Model</h1> <p id="fs-idp36394320">In 1972, S. J. Singer and Garth L. Nicolson proposed a new model of the plasma membrane that, compared to earlier understanding, better explained both microscopic observations and the function of the plasma membrane. This was called the fluid mosaic model. The model has evolved somewhat over time, but still best accounts for the structure and functions of the plasma membrane as we now understand them. The fluid mosaic model describes the structure of the <strong>plasma membrane as a mosaic of components—including phospholipids, cholesterol, proteins, and carbohydrates—in which the components are able to flow and change position</strong>, while maintaining the basic integrity of the membrane. Both phospholipid molecules and embedded proteins are able to diffuse rapidly and laterally in the membrane. The fluidity of the plasma membrane is necessary for the activities of certain enzymes and transport molecules within the membrane. Plasma membranes range from 5–10 nm thick. As a comparison, human red blood cells, visible via light microscopy, are approximately 8 µm thick, or approximately 1,000 times thicker than a plasma membrane.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch03_04_01"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-100" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_04_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_04_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4386" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_04_012.jpg" alt="the plasma membrane is composed of a phospholipid bilayer. in the bilayer, the two long hydrophobic tails of phospholipids face toward the center, and the hydrophilic head group faces the exterior.

Integral proteins are embedded in the plasma membrane and may span all or part of the membrane. Integral proteins may serve as channels or pumps to move materials into or out of the cell. Peripheral proteins are found on the exterior or interior surfaces of membranes, attached either to integral proteins or to phospholipid molecules. Both integral and peripheral proteins may serve as enzymes, as structural attachments for the fibers of the cytoskeleton, or as part of the cell’s recognition sites.</p> <p id="fs-idp98627584">Carbohydrates are the third major component of plasma membranes. They are always found on the exterior surface of cells and are bound either to proteins (forming glycoproteins) or to lipids (forming glycolipids). These carbohydrate chains may consist of 2–60 monosaccharide units and may be either straight or branched. Along with peripheral proteins, carbohydrates form specialized sites on the cell surface that allow cells to recognize each other.</p> <div id="fs-idm47628432" class="evolution non-majors"><h2>Evolution in Action</h2> <p id="fs-idp37714224">How Viruses Infect Specific OrgansSpecific glycoprotein molecules exposed on the surface of the cell membranes of host cells are exploited by many viruses to infect specific organs. For example, HIV is able to penetrate the plasma membranes of specific kinds of white blood cells called T-helper cells and monocytes, as well as some cells of the central nervous system. The hepatitis virus attacks only liver cells.</p> <p id="fs-idm41533632">These viruses are able to invade these cells, because the cells have binding sites on their surfaces that the viruses have exploited with equally specific glycoproteins in their coats. (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch03_04_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-4-the-cell-membrane/#fig-ch03_04_02">Figure 3.23</a>). The cell is tricked by the mimicry of the virus coat molecules, and the virus is able to enter the cell. Other recognition sites on the virus’s surface interact with the human immune system, prompting the body to produce antibodies. Antibodies are made in response to the antigens (or proteins associated with invasive pathogens). These same sites serve as places for antibodies to attach, and either destroy or inhibit the activity of the virus. Unfortunately, these sites on HIV are encoded by genes that change quickly, making the production of an effective vaccine against the virus very difficult. The virus population within an infected individual quickly evolves through mutation into different populations, or variants, distinguished by differences in these recognition sites. This rapid change of viral surface markers decreases the effectiveness of the person’s immune system in attacking the virus, because the antibodies will not recognize the new variations of the surface patterns.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_101" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-101" style="width: 344px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_04_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_04_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4401" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_04_022.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the plasma membrane of a T cell.

The plasma membrane is composed of a bilayer of phospholipids, with their hydrophobic, fatty acid tails in contact with each other. The landscape of the membrane is studded with proteins, some of which span the membrane. Some of these proteins serve to transport materials into or out of the cell. Carbohydrates are attached to some of the proteins and lipids on the outward-facing surface of the membrane. These form complexes that function to identify the cell to other cells. The fluid nature of the membrane owes itself to the configuration of the fatty acid tails, the presence of cholesterol embedded in the membrane (in animal cells), and the mosaic nature of the proteins and protein-carbohydrate complexes, which are not firmly fixed in place. Plasma membranes enclose the borders of cells, but rather than being a static bag, they are dynamic and constantly in flux.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In other words, plasma membranes are selectively permeable—they allow some substances through but not others. If they were to lose this selectivity, the cell would no longer be able to sustain itself, and it would be destroyed. Some cells require larger amounts of specific substances than do other cells; they must have a way of obtaining these materials from the extracellular fluids. This may happen passively, as certain materials move back and forth, or the cell may have special mechanisms that ensure transport. Most cells expend most of their energy, in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), to create and maintain an uneven distribution of ions on the opposite sides of their membranes. The structure of the plasma membrane contributes to these functions, but it also presents some problems.</p> <p id="fs-idp70714800">The most direct forms of membrane transport are passive. <strong>Passive transport is a naturally occurring phenomenon and does not require the cell to expend energy</strong> to accomplish the movement. In passive transport, substances move from an area of higher concentration to an area of lower concentration in a process called <strong>diffusion</strong>. A physical space in which there is a different concentration of a single substance is said to have a concentration gradient.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp136861952"><h1>Selective Permeability</h1> <p id="fs-idp23700048">Plasma membranes are asymmetric, meaning that despite the mirror image formed by the phospholipids, the interior of the membrane is not identical to the exterior of the membrane. Integral proteins that act as channels or pumps work in one direction. Carbohydrates, attached to lipids or proteins, are also found on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. These carbohydrate complexes help the cell bind substances that the cell needs in the extracellular fluid. This adds considerably to the selective nature of plasma membranes.</p> <p id="fs-idm10235008">Recall that plasma membranes have hydrophilic and hydrophobic regions. This characteristic helps the movement of certain materials through the membrane and hinders the movement of others. <strong>Lipid-soluble material can easily slip through the hydrophobic lipid core of the membrane</strong>. Substances such as the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K readily pass through the plasma membranes in the digestive tract and other tissues. Fat-soluble drugs also gain easy entry into cells and are readily transported into the body’s tissues and organs. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide have no charge and pass through by simple diffusion.</p> <p id="fs-idm68822080">Polar substances, with the exception of water, present problems for the membrane. While some polar molecules connect easily with the outside of a cell, they <strong>cannot readily pass through the lipid core of the plasma membrane</strong>. Additionally, whereas small ions could easily slip through the spaces in the mosaic of the membrane, their charge prevents them from doing so. Ions such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and chloride must have a special means of penetrating plasma membranes. Simple sugars and amino acids also need help with transport across plasma membranes.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp161276592"><h1>Diffusion</h1> <p id="fs-idm73792032">Diffusion is a passive process of transport. A single substance tends to <strong>move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration</strong> until the concentration is equal across the space. You are familiar with diffusion of substances through the air. For example, think about someone opening a bottle of perfume in a room filled with people. The perfume is at its highest concentration in the bottle and is at its lowest at the edges of the room. The perfume vapor will diffuse, or spread away, from the bottle, and gradually, more and more people will smell the perfume as it spreads. Materials move within the cell’s cytosol by diffusion, and certain materials move through the plasma membrane by diffusion (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch03_05_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-5-passive-transport/#fig-ch03_05_01">Figure 3.24</a>). Diffusion expends no energy. Rather the different concentrations of materials in different areas are a form of potential energy, and diffusion is the dissipation of that potential energy as materials move down their concentration gradients, from high to low.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_103" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-103" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_05_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_05_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4404" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_05_012.jpg" alt="The left part of this illustration shows a substance on one side of a membrane only.

However, the substances that undergo facilitated transport would otherwise not diffuse easily or quickly across the plasma membrane. The solution to moving polar substances and other substances across the plasma membrane rests in the proteins that span its surface. The material being transported is first attached to protein or glycoprotein receptors on the exterior surface of the plasma membrane. This allows the material that is needed by the cell to be removed from the extracellular fluid. The substances are then passed to specific integral proteins that facilitate their passage, because they form channels or pores that allow certain substances to pass through the membrane. The integral proteins involved in facilitated transport are collectively referred to as transport proteins, and they function as either channels for the material or carriers.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp97923296"><h1>Osmosis</h1> <p id="fs-idm17969952">Osmosis is the <strong>diffusion of water</strong> through a semipermeable membrane according to the concentration gradient of water across the membrane. Whereas diffusion transports material across membranes and within cells, osmosis transports <em>only water</em> across a membrane and the membrane limits the diffusion of solutes in the water. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. Water, like other substances, moves from an area of higher concentration to one of lower concentration. Imagine a beaker with a semipermeable membrane, separating the two sides or halves (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch03_05_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-5-passive-transport/#fig-ch03_05_02">Figure 3.25</a>). On both sides of the membrane, the water level is the same, but there are different concentrations on each side of a dissolved substance, or solute, that cannot cross the membrane. If the volume of the water is the same, but the concentrations of solute are different, then there are also different concentrations of water, the solvent, on either side of the membrane.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch03_05_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_104" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-104" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_05_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_05_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4406" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_05_022.jpg" alt="Two beakers are shown, each divided into left and right halves by a semipermeable membrane.

However, only the material capable of getting through the membrane will diffuse through it. In this example, the solute cannot diffuse through the membrane, but the water can. Water has a concentration gradient in this system. Therefore, water will diffuse down its concentration gradient, crossing the membrane to the side where it is less concentrated. This diffusion of water through the membrane—osmosis—will continue until the concentration gradient of water goes to zero. Osmosis proceeds constantly in living systems.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp113325968"><h1>Tonicity</h1> <p id="fs-idm6271344">Tonicity describes the amount of solute in a solution. The measure of the tonicity of a solution, or the total amount of solutes dissolved in a specific amount of solution, is called its osmolarity. Three terms—<strong>hypotonic, isotonic, and hypertonic</strong>—are used to relate the osmolarity of a cell to the osmolarity of the extracellular fluid that contains the cells. In a hypotonic solution, such as tap water, the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes than the fluid inside the cell, and water enters the cell. (In living systems, the point of reference is always the cytoplasm, so the prefix <em>hypo</em>– means that the extracellular fluid has a lower concentration of solutes, or a lower osmolarity, than the cell cytoplasm.) It also means that the extracellular fluid has a higher concentration of water than does the cell. In this situation, water will follow its concentration gradient and enter the cell. This may cause an animal cell to burst, or lyse.</p> <p id="fs-idm32200240">In a hypertonic solution (the prefix <em>hyper</em>– refers to the extracellular fluid having a higher concentration of solutes than the cell’s cytoplasm), the fluid contains less water than the cell does, such as seawater. Because the cell has a lower concentration of solutes, the water will leave the cell. In effect, the solute is drawing the water out of the cell. This may cause an animal cell to shrivel, or crenate.</p> <p id="fs-idm73395200">In an isotonic solution, the extracellular fluid has the same osmolarity as the cell. If the concentration of solutes of the cell matches that of the extracellular fluid, there will be no net movement of water into or out of the cell.

The plasma membrane can only expand to the limit of the cell wall, so the cell will not lyse. In fact, the cytoplasm in plants is always slightly hypertonic compared to the cellular environment, and water will always enter a cell if water is available.

Substances diffuse from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration, and this process continues until the substance is evenly distributed in a system. In solutions of more than one substance, each type of molecule diffuses according to its own concentration gradient. Many factors can affect the rate of diffusion, including concentration gradient, the sizes of the particles that are diffusing, and the temperature of the system.</p> <p>In living systems, diffusion of substances into and out of cells is mediated by the plasma membrane. Some materials diffuse readily through the membrane, but others are hindered, and their passage is only made possible by protein channels and carriers. The chemistry of living things occurs in aqueous solutions, and balancing the concentrations of those solutions is an ongoing problem.

If a substance must move into the cell against its concentration gradient, that is, if the concentration of the substance inside the cell must be greater than its concentration in the extracellular fluid, the cell must use energy to move the substance. Some active transport mechanisms move small-molecular weight material, such as ions, through the membrane.</p> <p id="fs-idp114125120">In addition to moving small ions and molecules through the membrane, cells also need to remove and take in larger molecules and particles. Some cells are even capable of engulfing entire unicellular microorganisms. You might have correctly hypothesized that the uptake and release of large particles by the cell requires energy. A large particle, however, cannot pass through the membrane, even with energy supplied by the cell.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp71584544"><h1>Electrochemical Gradient</h1> <p id="fs-idp33965648">We have discussed simple concentration gradients—differential concentrations of a substance across a space or a membrane—but in living systems, gradients are more complex. Because cells contain proteins, most of which are negatively charged, and because ions move into and out of cells, there is an electrical gradient, a difference of charge, across the plasma membrane. The interior of living cells is electrically negative with respect to the extracellular fluid in which they are bathed; at the same time, cells have higher concentrations of potassium (K<sup>+</sup>) and lower concentrations of sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) than does the extracellular fluid. Thus, in a living cell, the concentration gradient and electrical gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> promotes diffusion of the ion into the cell, and the electrical gradient of Na<sup>+</sup> (a positive ion) tends to drive it inward to the negatively charged interior. The situation is more complex, however, for other elements such as potassium. The electrical gradient of K<sup>+ </sup>promotes diffusion of the ion <em>into</em> the cell, but the concentration gradient of K<sup>+</sup> promotes diffusion <em>out</em> of the cell (Figure 3.28). The combined gradient that affects an ion is called its electrochemical gradient, and it is especially important to muscle and nerve cells.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-108" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_06_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_06_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4411" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_03_06_012.jpg" alt="A cell membrane is shown with a protein channel that allows passage of ions into and out of the cell.

This energy is harvested from ATP that is generated through cellular metabolism. Active transport mechanisms, collectively called <strong>pumps or carrier proteins</strong>, work against electrochemical gradients. With the exception of ions, small substances constantly pass through plasma membranes. Active transport maintains concentrations of ions and other substances needed by living cells in the face of these passive changes. <strong>Much of a cell’s supply of metabolic energy may be spent maintaining these processes</strong>. Because active transport mechanisms depend on cellular metabolism for energy, they are sensitive to many metabolic poisons that interfere with the supply of ATP.</p> <p id="fs-idm20132368">Two mechanisms exist for the transport of small-molecular weight material and macromolecules. Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane. The primary active transport system uses ATP to move a substance, such as an ion, into the cell, and often at the same time, a second substance is moved out of the cell. The sodium-potassium pump, an important pump in animal cells, expends energy to move potassium ions into the cell and a different number of sodium ions out of the cell (Figure 3.29). The action of this pump results in a concentration and charge difference across the membrane.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-109" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_06_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_03_06_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4412" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_03_06_022.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the sodium-potassium pump.

(c) In receptor-mediated endocytosis, uptake of substances by the cell is targeted to a single type of substance that binds at the receptor on the external cell membrane.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp88581936">Phagocytosis is the process by which large particles, such as cells, are taken in by a cell. For example, when microorganisms invade the human body, a type of white blood cell called a neutrophil removes the invader through this process, surrounding and engulfing the microorganism, which is then destroyed by the neutrophil (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure3.30" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-6-active-transport/#figure3.30">Figure 3.30</a>).</p> <p id="fs-idm23205152">A variation of endocytosis is called pinocytosis. This literally means “cell drinking” and was named at a time when the assumption was that the cell was purposefully taking in extracellular fluid. In reality, this process takes in solutes that the cell needs from the extracellular fluid (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure3.30" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-6-active-transport/#figure3.30">Figure 3.30</a>).</p> <p id="fs-idp1969200">A targeted variation of endocytosis employs binding proteins in the plasma membrane that are specific for certain substances (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure3.30" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/3-6-active-transport/#figure3.30">Figure 3.30</a>). The particles bind to the proteins and the plasma membrane invaginates, bringing the substance and the proteins into the cell. If passage across the membrane of the target of receptor-mediated endocytosis is ineffective, it will not be removed from the tissue fluids or blood. Instead, it will stay in those fluids and increase in concentration. Some human diseases are caused by a failure of receptor-mediated endocytosis. For example, the form of cholesterol termed low-density lipoprotein or LDL (also referred to as “bad” cholesterol) is removed from the blood by receptor-mediated endocytosis. In the human genetic disease familial hypercholesterolemia, the LDL receptors are defective or missing entirely. People with this condition have life-threatening levels of cholesterol in their blood, because their cells cannot clear the chemical from their blood.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp68317440"><h1>Exocytosis</h1> <p id="fs-idp18492384">In contrast to these methods of moving material into a cell is the process of exocytosis. Exocytosis is the opposite of the processes discussed above in that its purpose is to expel material from the cell into the extracellular fluid.

Living cells need certain substances in concentrations greater than they exist in the extracellular space. Moving substances up their electrochemical gradients requires energy from the cell. Active transport uses energy stored in ATP to fuel the transport. Active transport of small molecular-size material uses integral proteins in the cell membrane to move the material—these proteins are analogous to pumps. Some pumps, which carry out primary active transport, couple directly with ATP to drive their action. In secondary transport, energy from primary transport can be used to move another substance into the cell and up its concentration gradient.</p> <p>Endocytosis methods require the direct use of ATP to fuel the transport of large particles such as macromolecules; parts of cells or whole cells can be engulfed by other cells in a process called phagocytosis. In phagocytosis, a portion of the membrane invaginates and flows around the particle, eventually pinching off and leaving the particle wholly enclosed by an envelope of plasma membrane. Vacuoles are broken down by the cell, with the particles used as food or dispatched in some other way. Pinocytosis is a similar process on a smaller scale. The cell expels waste and other particles through the reverse process, exocytosis. Wastes are moved outside the cell, pushing a membranous vesicle to the plasma membrane, allowing the vesicle to fuse with the membrane and incorporating itself into the membrane structure, releasing its contents to the exterior of the cell.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Energy is needed to perform heavy labor and exercise, but humans also use energy while thinking, and even during sleep. In fact, the living cells of every organism constantly use energy. Nutrients and other molecules are imported into the cell, metabolized (broken down) and possibly synthesized into new molecules, modified if needed, transported around the cell, and possibly distributed to the entire organism. For example, the large proteins that make up muscles are built from smaller molecules imported from dietary amino acids. Complex carbohydrates are broken down into simple sugars that the cell uses for energy. Just as energy is required to both build and demolish a building, energy is required for the synthesis and breakdown of molecules as well as the transport of molecules into and out of cells. In addition, processes such as ingesting and breaking down pathogenic bacteria and viruses, exporting wastes and toxins, and movement of the cell require energy. From where, and in what form, does this energy come? How do living cells obtain energy, and how do they use it? This chapter will discuss different forms of energy and the physical laws that govern energy transfer. This chapter will also describe how cells use energy and replenish it, and how chemical reactions in the cell are performed with great efficiency.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Search for Key Points in Chapter 4</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

This is a classic example of one of the many cellular processes that use and produce energy. Living things consume sugars as a major energy source, because sugar molecules have a great deal of energy stored within their bonds. For the most part, photosynthesizing organisms like plants produce these sugars. During photosynthesis, plants use energy (originally from sunlight) to convert carbon dioxide gas (CO<sub>2</sub>) into sugar molecules (like glucose: C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). They consume carbon dioxide and produce oxygen as a waste product. This reaction is summarized as:</p> <p>6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy ——-&gt; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>+ 6O<sub>2</sub></p> <p id="fs-id1171054751170">Because this process involves synthesizing an energy-storing molecule, it requires energy input to proceed. During the light reactions of photosynthesis, <strong>energy is provided by a molecule called adenosine triphosphate (ATP)</strong>, which is the primary energy currency of all cells. Just as the dollar is used as currency to buy goods, cells use molecules of ATP as energy currency to perform immediate work. In contrast, energy-storage molecules such as glucose are consumed only to be broken down to use their energy. The reaction that harvests the energy of a sugar molecule in cells requiring oxygen to survive can be summarized by the reverse reaction to photosynthesis. In this reaction, oxygen is consumed and carbon dioxide is released as a waste product. The reaction is summarized as:</p> <p>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub> ——&gt; 6CO<sub>2</sub> + 6H<sub>2</sub>O + energy</p> <p>Both of these reactions involve many steps.</p> <p>The processes of making and breaking down sugar molecules illustrate two examples of metabolic pathways. A metabolic pathway is a series of chemical reactions that takes a starting molecule and modifies it, step-by-step, through a series of metabolic intermediates, eventually yielding a final product. In the example of sugar metabolism, the first metabolic pathway synthesized sugar from smaller molecules, and the other pathway broke sugar down into smaller molecules. These two opposite processes—the first requiring energy and the second producing energy—are referred to as <strong>anabolic pathways (building polymers) and catabolic pathways (breaking down polymers into their monomers)</strong>, respectively. Consequently, metabolism is composed of synthesis (anabolism) and degradation (catabolism) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_02">Figure 4.3</a>).</p> <p id="fs-id1171054732910">It is important to know that the chemical reactions of metabolic pathways do not take place on their own. Each reaction step is facilitated, or catalyzed, by a protein called an enzyme. <strong>Enzymes are important for catalyzing all types of biological reactions</strong>—those that require energy as well as those that release energy.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch04_01_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_117" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-117" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4421" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_022.jpg" alt="Anabolic and metabolic pathways are shown.

The matter relevant to a particular case of energy transfer is called a system, and everything outside of that matter is called the surroundings. For instance, when heating a pot of water on the stove, the system includes the stove, the pot, and the water. Energy is transferred within the system (between the stove, pot, and water). There are two types of systems: open and closed. In an open system, energy can be exchanged with its surroundings. The stovetop system is open because heat can be lost to the air. A closed system cannot exchange energy with its surroundings.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054752784">Biological organisms are open systems. Energy is exchanged between them and their surroundings as they use energy from the sun to perform photosynthesis or consume energy-storing molecules and release energy to the environment by doing work and releasing heat. Like all things in the physical world, energy is subject to physical laws. The laws of thermodynamics govern the transfer of energy in and among all systems in the universe.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054754011">In general, energy is defined as the ability to do work, or to create some kind of change. Energy exists in different forms. For example, electrical energy, light energy, and heat energy are all different types of energy. To appreciate the way energy flows into and out of biological systems, it is important to understand two of the physical laws that govern energy.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id1171054714500"><h1>Thermodynamics</h1> <p id="fs-id1171054744028">The first law of thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant and conserved. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe. <strong>Energy exists in many different forms</strong>. According to the first law of thermodynamics, energy may be transferred from place to place or transformed into different forms, <strong>but it cannot be created or destroyed</strong>. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. Light bulbs transform electrical energy into light and heat energy. Gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful energy transformations on earth: that of converting the energy of sunlight to chemical energy stored within organic molecules (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_01">Figure 4.2</a>). Some examples of energy transformations are shown in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure4.4" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#figure4.4">Figure 4.4</a>.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054712641">The challenge for all living organisms is to obtain energy from their surroundings in forms that they can transfer or transform into usable energy to do work. Living cells have evolved to meet this challenge. Chemical energy stored within organic molecules such as sugars and fats is transferred and transformed through a series of cellular chemical reactions into energy within molecules of ATP. Energy in ATP molecules is easily accessible to do work. Examples of the types of work that cells need to do include building complex molecules, transporting materials, powering the motion of cilia or flagella, and contracting muscle fibers to create movement.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="figure4.4"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_118" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-118" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4422" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_032.jpg" alt="The left side of this diagram depicts energy being transferred from an ice cream cone to two boys riding bikes.

However, the <strong>second law of thermodynamics</strong> explains why these tasks are harder than they appear. <strong>All energy transfers and transformations are never completely efficient</strong>. In every energy transfer, some amount of energy is lost in a form that is unusable. In most cases, this form is heat energy. Thermodynamically, heat energy is defined as the energy transferred from one system to another that is not work. For example, when a light bulb is turned on, some of the energy being converted from electrical energy into light energy is lost as heat energy. Likewise, some energy is lost as heat energy during cellular metabolic reactions.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054726672">An important concept in physical systems is that of order and disorder. The more energy that is lost by a system to its surroundings, the less ordered and more random the system is. Scientists refer to the measure of <strong>randomness or disorder within a system as entropy</strong>. High entropy means high disorder and low energy. Molecules and chemical reactions have varying entropy as well. For example, entropy increases as molecules at a high concentration in one place diffuse and spread out. The second law of thermodynamics says that energy will always be lost as heat in energy transfers or transformations.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054733041">Living things are highly ordered, requiring constant energy input to be maintained in a state of low entropy.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id1171054727835"><h1>Potential and Kinetic Energy</h1> <p id="fs-id1171054712735">When an object is in motion, there is energy associated with that object. Think of a wrecking ball. Even a slow-moving wrecking ball can do a great deal of damage to other objects. Energy associated with objects in motion is called kinetic energy (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure4.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#figure4.5">Figure 4.5</a>). A speeding bullet, a walking person, and the rapid movement of molecules in the air (which produces heat) all have kinetic energy.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054755440">Now what if that same motionless wrecking ball is lifted two stories above ground with a crane? If the suspended wrecking ball is unmoving, is there energy associated with it? The answer is yes. The energy that was required to lift the wrecking ball did not disappear, but is now stored in the wrecking ball by virtue of its position and the force of gravity acting on it. This type of energy is called potential energy (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure4.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#figure4.5">Figure 4.5</a>). If the ball were to fall, the potential energy would be transformed into kinetic energy until all of the potential energy was exhausted when the ball rested on the ground. Wrecking balls also swing like a pendulum; through the swing, there is a constant change of potential energy (highest at the top of the swing) to kinetic energy (highest at the bottom of the swing). Other examples of potential energy include the energy of water held behind a dam or a person about to skydive out of an airplane.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure4.5"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_119" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-119" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_04ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_04ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4423" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_04ab2.jpg" alt="The photo on the left shows water behind a dam as potential energy.

Even a spring on the ground has potential energy if it is compressed; so does a rubber band that is pulled taut. On a molecular level, the bonds that hold the atoms of molecules together exist in a particular structure that has potential energy. Remember that anabolic cellular pathways require energy to synthesize complex molecules from simpler ones and catabolic pathways release energy when complex molecules are broken down. The fact that energy can be released by the breakdown of certain chemical bonds implies that those bonds have potential energy. In fact, there is potential energy stored within the bonds of all the food molecules we eat, which is eventually harnessed for use. This is because these bonds can release energy when broken. The type of potential energy that exists within chemical bonds, and is released when those bonds are broken, is called chemical energy. Chemical energy is responsible for providing living cells with energy from food. The release of energy occurs when the molecular bonds within food molecules are broken.</p> <div id="fs-id1171054713445" class="interactive non-majors"><p>Watch a video about kilocalories.</p> </div> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

How can the energy released from one reaction be compared to that of another reaction? A measurement of free energy is used to quantify these energy transfers. Recall that according to the second law of thermodynamics, all energy transfers involve the loss of some amount of energy in an unusable form such as heat. Free energy specifically refers to the energy associated with a chemical reaction that is available after the losses are accounted for. In other words, free energy is usable energy, or energy that is available to do work.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054738634">If energy is released during a chemical reaction, then the change in free energy, signified as ∆G (delta G) will be a negative number. A negative change in free energy also means that the products of the reaction have less free energy than the reactants, because they release some free energy during the reaction. Reactions that have a negative change in free energy and consequently release free energy are called exergonic reactions. Think: <strong><em>ex</em>ergonic</strong> means energy is <em>ex</em>iting the system. These reactions are also referred to as spontaneous reactions, and their products have less stored energy than the reactants. An important distinction must be drawn between the term spontaneous and the idea of a chemical reaction occurring immediately. Contrary to the everyday use of the term, a spontaneous reaction is not one that suddenly or quickly occurs. The rusting of iron is an example of a spontaneous reaction that occurs slowly, little by little, over time.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054710346">If a chemical reaction absorbs energy rather than releases energy on balance, then the ∆G for that reaction will be a positive value. In this case, the products have more free energy than the reactants. Thus, the products of these reactions can be thought of as energy-storing molecules. These chemical reactions are called <strong>endergonic</strong> reactions and they are <strong>non-spontaneous</strong>. An endergonic reaction will not take place on its own without the addition of free energy.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div id="figure4.6" class="art-connection non-majors"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_121" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-121" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_05abcd.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_05abcd.png"><img class="wp-image-4425" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1.png" alt="Four photos, from left to right, show a compost pile, a baby chick emerging from a fertilized egg, a teabag’s dark-colored contents diffusing into a clear mug of water, and a ball rolling downhill." width="600" height="485" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1-300x242.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1-768x620.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1-65x52.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1-225x182.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_05abcd-1024x8272-1-350x283.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-121">Figure 4.6 Shown are some examples of endergonic processes (ones that require energy) and exergonic processes (ones that release energy).

Most enzymes are <strong>proteins</strong> and perform the critical task of <strong>lowering the activation energies</strong> of chemical reactions inside the cell. Most of the reactions critical to a living cell happen too slowly at normal temperatures to be of any use to the cell. Without enzymes to <strong>speed up these reactions</strong>, life could not persist. Enzymes do this by binding to the reactant molecules and holding them in such a way as to make the chemical bond-breaking and -forming processes take place more easily. It is important to remember that enzymes do not change whether a reaction is exergonic (spontaneous) or endergonic. This is because they do not change the free energy of the reactants or products. They only reduce the activation energy required for the reaction to go forward (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_06" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_06">Figure 4.7</a>). In addition, an enzyme itself is unchanged by the reaction it catalyzes. Once one reaction has been catalyzed, the enzyme is able to participate in other reactions.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch04_01_06"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_123" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-123" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4427" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062.jpg" alt="This plot shows that a catalyst decreases the activation energy for a reaction but does not change the Gibbs free energy." width="400" height="343" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062-300x257.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062-65x56.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062-225x193.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_062-350x300.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-123">Figure 4.7 Enzymes lower the activation energy of the reaction but do not change the free energy of the reaction.<span style="text-align: initial;font-size: 1em">&nbsp;</span></div></div> </div> <p id="fs-id1171054748542">The chemical reactants to which an enzyme binds are called the enzyme’s substrates. There may be one or more substrates, depending on the particular chemical reaction. In some reactions, a single reactant substrate is broken down into multiple products. In others, two substrates may come together to create one larger molecule. Two reactants might also enter a reaction and both become modified, but they leave the reaction as two products. The location within the enzyme where the substrate binds is called the enzyme’s <strong>active site</strong>. The active site is where the “action” happens. Since enzymes are proteins, there is a unique combination of amino acid side chains within the active site. Each side chain is characterized by different properties. They can be large or small, weakly acidic or basic, hydrophilic or hydrophobic, positively or negatively charged, or neutral. The unique combination of side chains creates a very specific chemical environment within the active site. This specific environment is suited to bind to one specific chemical substrate (or substrates).</p> <p id="fs-id1171054738236">Active sites are subject to influences of the local environment. Increasing the environmental temperature generally increases reaction rates, enzyme-catalyzed or otherwise. However, temperatures outside of an optimal range reduce the rate at which an enzyme catalyzes a reaction. Hot temperatures will eventually cause enzymes to denature, an irreversible change in the three-dimensional shape and therefore the function of the enzyme. Enzymes are also suited to function best within a certain pH and salt concentration range, and, as with temperature, extreme pH, and salt concentrations can cause enzymes to denature.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054748478">For many years, scientists thought that enzyme-substrate binding took place in a simple “lock and key” fashion. This model asserted that the enzyme and substrate fit together perfectly in one instantaneous step. However, current research supports a model called induced fit (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_07" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_07">Figure 4.8</a>). The induced-fit model expands on the lock-and-key model by describing a more dynamic binding between enzyme and substrate. As the enzyme and substrate come together, their interaction causes a mild shift in the enzyme’s structure that forms an ideal binding arrangement between enzyme and substrate.</p> <div id="fs-id1171054748830" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-id1171054711134"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/hexokinase22.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-id1171054727196">View an <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hexokinase2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hexokinase2">animation</a> of induced fit.</p> </div> <p id="fs-id1171054726878">When an enzyme binds its substrate, an enzyme-substrate complex is formed. This complex lowers the activation energy of the reaction and promotes its rapid progression in one of multiple possible ways. On a basic level, enzymes promote chemical reactions that involve more than one substrate by bringing the substrates together in an optimal orientation for reaction. Another way in which enzymes promote the reaction of their substrates is by creating an optimal environment within the active site for the reaction to occur. The chemical properties that emerge from the particular arrangement of amino acid R groups within an active site create the perfect environment for an enzyme’s specific substrates to react.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054717760">The enzyme-substrate complex can also lower activation energy by compromising the bond structure so that it is easier to break. Finally, enzymes can also lower activation energies by taking part in the chemical reaction itself. In these cases, it is important to remember that the enzyme will always return to its original state by the completion of the reaction. One of the hallmark properties of enzymes is that they remain ultimately unchanged by the reactions they catalyze. After an enzyme has catalyzed a reaction, it releases its product(s) and can catalyze a new reaction.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch04_01_07"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-125" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4429" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_072.jpg" alt="In this diagram, a substrate binds the active site of an enzyme and, in the process, both the shape of the enzyme and the shape of the substrate change.

However, a variety of mechanisms ensures that this does not happen. Cellular needs and conditions constantly vary from cell to cell, and change within individual cells over time. The required enzymes of stomach cells differ from those of fat storage cells, skin cells, blood cells, and nerve cells. Furthermore, a digestive organ cell works much harder to process and break down nutrients during the time that closely follows a meal compared with many hours after a meal. As these cellular demands and conditions vary, so must the amounts and functionality of different enzymes.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054733924">Since the rates of biochemical reactions are controlled by activation energy, and enzymes lower and determine activation energies for chemical reactions, the relative amounts and functioning of the variety of enzymes within a cell ultimately determine which reactions will proceed and at what rates. This determination is tightly controlled in cells. In certain cellular environments, enzyme activity is partly controlled by environmental factors like pH, temperature, salt concentration, and, in some cases, cofactors or coenzymes.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054733968"><strong>Enzymes can also be regulated</strong> in ways that either promote or reduce enzyme activity. There are many kinds of molecules that inhibit or promote enzyme function, and various mechanisms by which they do so. In some cases of enzyme <strong>inhibition</strong>, an inhibitor molecule is similar enough to a substrate that it can bind to the active site and simply block the substrate from binding. When this happens, the enzyme is inhibited through <strong>competitive inhibition</strong>, because an inhibitor molecule competes with the substrate for binding to the active site.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054751696">On the other hand, in <strong>noncompetitive inhibition</strong>, an inhibitor molecule binds to the enzyme in a location other than the active site, called an <strong>allosteric site</strong>, but still manages to block substrate binding to the active site. Some inhibitor molecules bind to enzymes in a location where their binding induces a conformational change that reduces the affinity of the enzyme for its substrate. This type of inhibition is called allosteric inhibition (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_08" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_08">Figure 4.9</a>). Most allosterically regulated enzymes are made up of more than one polypeptide, meaning that they have more than one protein subunit. When an allosteric inhibitor binds to a region on an enzyme, all active sites on the protein subunits are changed slightly such that they bind their substrates with less efficiency. There are allosteric activators as well as inhibitors. Allosteric activators bind to locations on an enzyme away from the active site, inducing a conformational change that increases the affinity of the enzyme’s active site(s) for its substrate(s) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch04_01_08" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#fig-ch04_01_08">Figure 4.9</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch04_01_08"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-126" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_08.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_08.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4430" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_082.jpg" alt="The left part of this diagram shows allosteric inhibition.

Secondary metabolites are the most common way plants deter predators.&nbsp; Some examples of secondary metabolites are atropine, nicotine, THC and caffeine. Humans have found these secondary metabolite compounds a rich source of materials for medicines. It is estimated that 90% of the drugs in the modern pharmacy have their “roots” in these secondary metabolites.</p> <p>First peoples herbal treatments revealed these secondary metabolites to the world. For example, Indigenous peoples have long used the bark of willow shrubs and alder trees for a tea, tonic or poultice to reduce inflammation.

In the inflammatory response two enzymes, COX1 and COX2 are key to this process. Salicin or aspirin specifically modifies an amino acid (serine) in the active site of these two related enzymes. This modification of the active sites does not allow the normal substrate to bind and so the inflammatory process is disrupted.

Understanding how enzymes work and how they can be regulated are key principles behind the development of many of the pharmaceutical drugs on the market today. Biologists working in this field collaborate with other scientists to design drugs (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure4.11" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#figure4.11">Figure 4.11</a>).</p> <p id="fs-id1171054847233">Consider statins for example—statins is the name given to one class of drugs that can reduce cholesterol levels. These compounds are inhibitors of the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase, which is the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the level of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced. Similarly, acetaminophen, popularly marketed under the brand name Tylenol, is an inhibitor of the enzyme cyclooxygenase. While it is used to provide relief from fever and inflammation (pain), its mechanism of action is still not completely understood.</p> <p id="fs-id1171054847236">How are drugs discovered? One of the biggest challenges in drug discovery is identifying a drug target. A drug target is a molecule that is literally the target of the drug. In the case of statins, HMG-CoA reductase is the drug target. Drug targets are identified through painstaking research in the laboratory. Identifying the target alone is not enough; scientists also need to know how the target acts inside the cell and which reactions go awry in the case of disease. Once the target and the pathway are identified, then the actual process of drug design begins. In this stage, chemists and biologists work together to design and synthesize molecules that can block or activate a particular reaction. However, this is only the beginning: If and when a drug prototype is successful in performing its function, then it is subjected to many tests from in vitro experiments to clinical trials before it can get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to be on the market.</p> </div> <p id="fs-id1171054757592">Many enzymes do not work optimally, or even at all, unless bound to other specific non-protein helper molecules. They may bond either temporarily through ionic or hydrogen bonds, or permanently through stronger covalent bonds. Binding to these molecules promotes optimal shape and function of their respective enzymes. Two examples of these types of helper molecules are cofactors and coenzymes. Cofactors are inorganic ions such as ions of iron and magnesium. Coenzymes are organic helper molecules, those with a basic atomic structure made up of carbon and hydrogen. Like enzymes, these molecules participate in reactions without being changed themselves and are ultimately recycled and reused. Vitamins are the source of coenzymes. Some vitamins are the precursors of coenzymes and others act directly as coenzymes. Vitamin C is a direct coenzyme for multiple enzymes that take part in building the important connective tissue, collagen. Therefore, enzyme function is, in part, regulated by the abundance of various cofactors and coenzymes, which may be supplied by an organism’s diet or, in some cases, produced by the organism.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-4431" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_06_05_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_06_05_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4433 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-300x149.png" alt="Shown are the molecular structures for Vitamin A, folic acid, Vitamin B1, Vitamin C, Vitamin B2, Vitamin D2, Vitamin B6, and Vitamin E." width="300" height="149" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-300x149.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-768x381.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-65x32.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-225x112.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1-350x174.png 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_03-1024x508-1.png 1024w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 4.12 Vitamins are important coenzymes or precursors of coenzymes, and are required for enzymes to function properly.

The major question remains, however: What are these molecules and where do they come from? Some are cofactors and coenzymes, as you have learned. What other molecules in the cell provide enzymatic regulation such as allosteric modulation, and competitive and non-competitive inhibition? Perhaps the most relevant sources of regulatory molecules, with respect to enzymatic cellular metabolism, are the products of the cellular metabolic reactions themselves. In a most efficient and elegant way, cells have evolved to use the products of their own reactions for feedback inhibition of enzyme activity. Feedback inhibition involves the use of a reaction product to regulate its own further production (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure4.12" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-1-energy-and-metabolism/#figure4.12">Figure 4.12</a>). The cell responds to an abundance of the products by slowing down production during anabolic or catabolic reactions. Such reaction products may inhibit the enzymes that catalyzed their production through the mechanisms described above.</p> <div id="figure4.12"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_151" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-151" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_10.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_01_10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4434" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_01_102.jpg" alt="This diagram shows a metabolic pathway in which three enzymes convert a substrate, in three steps, into a final product.

Additionally, ATP is an allosteric regulator of some of the enzymes involved in the catabolic breakdown of sugar, the process that creates ATP. In this way, when ATP is in abundant supply, the cell can prevent the production of ATP. On the other hand, ADP serves as a positive allosteric regulator (an allosteric activator) for some of the same enzymes that are inhibited by ATP. Thus, when relative levels of ADP are high compared to ATP, the cell is triggered to produce more ATP through sugar catabolism.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-id1171054743679"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm57969984">Cells perform the functions of life through various chemical reactions. A cell’s metabolism refers to the combination of chemical reactions that take place within it. Catabolic reactions break down complex chemicals into simpler ones and are associated with energy release. Anabolic processes build complex molecules out of simpler ones and require energy.</p> <p id="fs-idp175871760">In studying energy, the term system refers to the matter and environment involved in energy transfers. Entropy is a measure of the disorder of a system. The physical laws that describe the transfer of energy are the laws of thermodynamics. The first law states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. The second law of thermodynamics states that every energy transfer involves some loss of energy in an unusable form, such as heat energy. Energy comes in different forms: kinetic, potential, and free. The change in free energy of a reaction can be negative (releases energy, exergonic) or positive (consumes energy, endergonic). All reactions require an initial input of energy to proceed, called the activation energy.</p> <p id="fs-idp110287120">Enzymes are chemical catalysts that speed up chemical reactions by lowering their activation energy. Enzymes have an active site with a unique chemical environment that fits particular chemical reactants for that enzyme, called substrates. Enzymes and substrates are thought to bind according to an induced-fit model. Enzyme action is regulated to conserve resources and respond optimally to the environment.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Most of these pathways are combinations of oxidation and reduction reactions. Oxidation and reduction occur in tandem. An oxidation reaction strips an electron from an atom in a compound, and the addition of this electron to another compound is a reduction reaction. Because oxidation and reduction usually occur together, these pairs of reactions are called oxidation-reduction reactions, or redox reactions.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id1798739"><h1>Electrons and Energy</h1> <p id="fs-id3112918">The removal of an electron from a molecule, oxidizing it, results in a decrease in potential energy in the oxidized compound. The electron (sometimes as part of a hydrogen atom) does not remain unbonded, however, in the cytoplasm of a cell. Rather, the electron is shifted to a second compound, reducing the second compound. The shift of an electron from one compound to another removes some potential energy from the first compound (the <strong>oxidized</strong> compound) and increases the potential energy of the second compound (the <strong>reduced</strong> compound). The transfer of electrons between molecules is important because most of the energy stored in atoms and used to <strong>fuel cell functions is in the form of high-energy electrons</strong>. The transfer of energy in the form of electrons allows the cell to transfer and use energy in an incremental fashion—in small packages rather than in a single, destructive burst. This chapter focuses on the extraction of energy from food. You will see that as you track the path of the transfers, you are tracking the path of electrons moving through metabolic pathways.</p> <h2>Electron Carriers</h2> <p id="fs-id1405882">In living systems, a small class of compounds functions as electron shuttles: they bind and carry high-energy electrons between compounds in pathways. The principal electron carriers we will consider are derived from the B vitamin group and are derivatives of nucleotides. These compounds can be easily reduced (that is, they accept electrons) or oxidized (they lose electrons). Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) (<a href="#figure4.13" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-2-glycolysis/#figure4.13">Figure 4.13</a>) is derived from vitamin B3, niacin. NAD<sup>+</sup> is the oxidized form of the molecule; NADH is the reduced form of the molecule after it has accepted two electrons and a proton (which together are the equivalent of a hydrogen atom with an extra electron).</p> <p id="fs-id1464730">NAD<sup>+</sup> can accept electrons from an organic molecule according to the general equation:</p> <p>RH (Reducing Agent) + NAD <sup>+</sup> (Oxidizing Agent) —-&gt; NADH (Reduced) + R (Oxidized)</p> <p id="fs-id2073095"><strong>When electrons are added to a compound, they are reduced</strong>. A compound that reduces another is called a reducing agent. In the above equation, RH is a reducing agent, and NAD<sup>+</sup> is reduced to NADH. When <strong>electrons are removed from compound, it is oxidized</strong>. A compound that oxidizes another is called an oxidizing agent. In the above equation, NAD<sup>+</sup> is an oxidizing agent, and RH is oxidized to R.</p> <p id="fs-id2583910">Similarly, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD<sup>+</sup>) is derived from vitamin B<sub>2</sub>, also called riboflavin. Its reduced form is FADH<sub>2</sub>. A second variation of NAD, NADP, contains an extra phosphate group. Both NAD<sup>+</sup> and FAD<sup>+</sup> are extensively used in energy extraction from sugars, and NADP plays an important role in anabolic reactions and photosynthesis.</p> <div id="figure4.13"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_830" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-830" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_07_01_01ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_07_01_01ab.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-4437" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_01_01ab-300x1992-1.jpg" alt="This illustration shows the molecular structure of NAD^{+} and NADH.

Excess free energy would result in an increase of heat in the cell, which would result in excessive thermal motion that could damage and then destroy the cell. Rather, a cell must be able to handle that energy in a way that enables the cell to store the energy safely and release it for use only as needed. Living cells accomplish this by using the compound adenosine triphosphate (ATP). ATP is often called the “<strong>energy currency</strong>” of the cell, and, like currency, this versatile compound can be used to fill any energy need of the cell. How? It functions similarly to a rechargeable battery.</p> <p id="fs-id1359897">When ATP is broken down, usually by the removal of its terminal phosphate group, energy is released. The cell uses the energy to do work, usually by the released phosphate binding to another molecule, activating it. For example, in the mechanical work of muscle contraction, ATP supplies the energy to move the contractile muscle proteins. Recall the active transport work of the sodium-potassium pump in cell membranes. ATP alters the structure of the integral protein that functions as the pump, changing its affinity for sodium and potassium. In this way, the cell performs work, pumping ions against their electrochemical gradients.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2183864"><h2>ATP Structure and Function</h2> <p id="fs-id1595819">At the heart of ATP is a molecule of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), which is composed of an adenine molecule bonded to a ribose molecule and a single phosphate group (<a href="#figure4.14" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-2-glycolysis/#figure4.14">Figure 4.14</a>).

However, consider endergonic reactions, which require much more energy input because their products have more free energy than their reactants. Within the cell, where does energy to power such reactions come from? The answer lies with an energy-supplying molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. ATP is a small, relatively simple molecule, but within its bonds contains the potential for a <strong>quick burst of energy that can be harnessed to perform cellular work</strong>. This molecule can be thought of as the primary energy currency of cells in the same way that money is the currency that people exchange for things they need.

Glycolysis is the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy for cell metabolism. Many living organisms carry out glycolysis as part of their metabolism. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of most prokaryotic and all eukaryotic cells.</p> <p id="fs-id1871054">Glycolysis begins with the six-carbon, ring-shaped structure of a single glucose molecule and ends with two molecules of a three-carbon sugar called pyruvate. Glycolysis consists of two distinct phases. In the first part of the glycolysis pathway, energy is used to make adjustments so that the six-carbon sugar molecule can be split evenly into two three-carbon pyruvate molecules.

Glycolysis consists of two parts: The first part prepares the six-carbon ring of glucose for separation into two three-carbon sugars. Energy from ATP is invested into the molecule during this step to energize the separation. The second half of glycolysis extracts ATP and high-energy electrons from hydrogen atoms and attaches them to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Two ATP molecules are invested in the first half and four ATP molecules are formed during the second half.

Most of the ATP generated during the aerobic catabolism of glucose, however, is not generated directly from these pathways. Rather, it derives from a process that begins with passing electrons through a series of chemical reactions to a final electron acceptor, oxygen. These reactions take place in specialized protein complexes located in <strong>the inner membrane of the mitochondria</strong> of eukaryotic organisms and on the inner part of the cell membrane of prokaryotic organisms. The energy of the electrons is harvested and used to generate a <strong>electrochemical gradient</strong> across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The <strong>potential energy of this gradient is used to generate ATP</strong>.

Oxygen continuously diffuses into plants for this purpose. In animals, oxygen enters the body through the respiratory system. Electron transport is a series of chemical reactions that resembles a bucket brigade in that electrons are passed rapidly from one component to the next, to the endpoint of the chain where oxygen is the final electron acceptor and water is produced.

The electron transport chain is present in multiple copies in the inner mitochondrial membrane of eukaryotes and in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes. In each transfer of an electron through the electron transport chain, the electron loses energy, but with some transfers, the energy is stored as potential energy by using it to pump hydrogen ions across the inner mitochondrial membrane into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.</p> <div id="fs-id2115964" class="art-connection non-majors"><div class="bc-figure figure" id="fs-id2150493"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_134" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-134" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_03_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_03_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4445" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_04_03_02-1004x10242-1.png" alt="Part a: This illustration shows the electron transport chain embedded in the inner mitochondrial membrane.

As they are passed from one complex to another (there are a total of four), the electrons lose energy, and some of that energy is used to pump hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial matrix into the intermembrane space. In the fourth protein complex, the electrons are accepted by oxygen, the terminal acceptor. The oxygen with its extra electrons then combines with two hydrogen ions, further enhancing the electrochemical gradient, to form water. If there were no oxygen present in the mitochondrion, the electrons could not be removed from the system, and the entire electron transport chain would back up and stop. The mitochondria would be unable to generate new ATP in this way, and the cell would ultimately die from lack of energy. This is the reason we must breathe to draw in new oxygen.</p> <p id="fs-id2168726">In the electron transport chain, the free energy from the series of reactions just described is used to pump hydrogen ions across the membrane.

This complex protein acts as a tiny generator, turned by the force of the hydrogen ions diffusing through it, down their electrochemical gradient from the intermembrane space, where there are many mutually repelling hydrogen ions to the matrix, where there are few. The turning of the parts of this molecular machine regenerate ATP from ADP. This flow of hydrogen ions across the membrane through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis.</p> <p id="fs-id2076615">Chemiosmosis (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fs-id2150493" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/4-3-citric-acid-cycle-and-oxidative-phosphorylation/#fs-id2150493">Figure 4.19</a>&nbsp;<strong>c</strong>) is used to generate 90 percent of the ATP made during aerobic glucose catabolism. The result of the reactions is the production of ATP from the energy of the electrons removed from hydrogen atoms. These atoms were originally part of a glucose molecule. At the end of the electron transport system, the electrons are used to reduce an oxygen molecule to oxygen ions. The extra electrons on the oxygen ions attract hydrogen ions (protons) from the surrounding medium, and water is formed. The electron transport chain and the production of ATP through chemiosmosis are collectively called oxidative phosphorylation.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2645823"><h1>ATP Yield</h1> <p id="fs-id3293995">The number of ATP molecules generated from the catabolism of glucose varies. For example, the number of hydrogen ions that the electron transport chain complexes can pump through the membrane varies between species. Another source of variance stems from the shuttle of electrons across the mitochondrial membrane. The NADH generated from glycolysis cannot easily enter mitochondria. Thus, electrons are picked up on the inside of the mitochondria by either NAD<sup>+</sup> or FAD<sup>+</sup>. Fewer ATP molecules are generated when FAD<sup>+</sup> acts as a carrier. NAD<sup>+</sup> is used as the electron transporter in the liver and FAD<sup>+</sup> in the brain, so ATP yield depends on the tissue being considered.</p> <p id="fs-id2151170">Another factor that affects the yield of ATP molecules generated from glucose is that intermediate compounds in these pathways are used for other purposes. Glucose catabolism connects with the pathways that build or break down all other biochemical compounds in cells, and the result is somewhat messier than the ideal situations described thus far. For example, sugars other than glucose are fed into the glycolytic pathway for energy extraction. Other molecules that would otherwise be used to harvest energy in glycolysis or the citric acid cycle may be removed to form nucleic acids, amino acids, lipids, or other compounds. Overall, in living systems, these pathways of glucose catabolism extract about 34 percent of the energy contained in glucose.</p> <h2>Mitochondrial Disease Physician</h2> <p>What happens when the critical reactions of cellular respiration do not proceed correctly? Mitochondrial diseases are genetic disorders of metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders can arise from mutations in nuclear or mitochondrial DNA, and they result in the production of less energy than is normal in body cells. Symptoms of mitochondrial diseases can include muscle weakness, lack of coordination, stroke-like episodes, and loss of vision and hearing. Most affected people are diagnosed in childhood, although there are some adult-onset diseases. Identifying and treating mitochondrial disorders is a specialized medical field. The educational preparation for this profession requires a college education, followed by medical school with a specialization in medical genetics. Medical geneticists can be board certified by the American Board of Medical Genetics and go on to become associated with professional organizations devoted to the study of mitochondrial disease, such as the Mitochondrial Medicine Society and the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disease.</p> <div class="summary" id="fs-id1434651"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-id3032720">The citric acid cycle is a series of chemical reactions that removes high-energy electrons and uses them in the electron transport chain to generate ATP.

Once the lactic acid has been removed from the muscle and is circulated to the liver, it can be converted back to pyruvic acid and further catabolized for energy.</p> <div id="fs-id1858158" class="art-connection non-majors"><div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure4.20"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_04_01.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_04_04_01.png"><img class="wp-image-4448" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012.png" alt="Lactic acid fermentation is common in muscles that have become exhausted by use." width="400" height="513" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012.png 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012-234x300.png 234w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012-65x83.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012-225x288.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_04_04_012-350x448.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-136">Figure 4.20</div></div> </div></div> <p id="fs-id1799094">Tremetol, a metabolic poison found in white snake root plant, prevents the metabolism of lactate.

Metabolic pathways should be thought of as porous—that is, substances enter from other pathways, and other substances leave for other pathways. These pathways are not closed systems. Many of the products in a particular pathway are reactants in other pathways.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2004574"><h1>Connections of Other Sugars to Glucose Metabolism</h1> <p id="fs-id1193992">Glycogen, a polymer of glucose, is a short-term energy storage molecule in animals. When there is adequate ATP present, excess glucose is converted into glycogen for storage. <strong>Glycogen is made and stored in the liver and muscle</strong>. Glycogen will be taken out of storage if blood sugar levels drop. The presence of glycogen in muscle cells as a source of glucose allows ATP to be produced for a longer time during exercise.</p> <p id="fs-id2637831">Sucrose is a disaccharide made from glucose and fructose bonded together. Sucrose is broken down in the small intestine, and the glucose and fructose are absorbed separately. Fructose is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose (which is part of milk sugar, the disaccharide lactose), that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. The catabolism of both fructose and galactose produces the same number of ATP molecules as glucose.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2154892"><h1>Connections of Proteins to Glucose Metabolism</h1> <p id="fs-id1360276">Proteins are broken down by a variety of enzymes in cells. Most of the time, amino acids are recycled into new proteins. If there are excess amino acids, however, or if the body is in a <strong>state of famine</strong>, some amino acids will be shunted into pathways of glucose catabolism. Each amino acid must have its amino group removed prior to entry into these pathways. The amino group is converted into ammonia. In mammals, the liver synthesizes urea from two ammonia molecules and a carbon dioxide molecule. Thus, urea is the principal waste product in mammals from the nitrogen originating in amino acids, and it leaves the body in urine.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section"><h1>Connections of Lipids to Glucose Metabolism</h1> <p id="fs-id1973636">The lipids that are connected to the glucose pathways are <strong>cholesterol and triglycerides</strong>. Cholesterol is a lipid that contributes to cell membrane flexibility and is a precursor of steroid hormones. The synthesis of cholesterol starts with acetyl CoA and proceeds in only one direction. The process cannot be reversed, and ATP is not produced.</p> <p id="fs-id2596571">Triglycerides are a form of long-term energy storage in animals. Triglycerides store about twice as much energy as carbohydrates. Triglycerides are made of glycerol and three fatty acids. Animals can make most of the fatty acids they need. Triglycerides can be both made and broken down through parts of the glucose catabolism pathways. Glycerol can be phosphorylated and proceeds through glycolysis.

If these cells reproduced successfully and their numbers climbed steadily, it follows that the cells would begin to deplete the nutrients from the medium in which they lived, as they shifted the nutrients into their own cells. This hypothetical situation would have resulted in natural selection favoring those organisms that could exist by using the nutrients that remained in their environment and by manipulating these nutrients into materials that they could use to survive. Additionally, selection would favor those organisms that could extract maximal value from the available nutrients.</p> <p id="fs-id2073097">An early form of photosynthesis developed that harnessed the sun’s energy using compounds other than water as a source of hydrogen atoms, but this pathway did not produce free oxygen. It is thought that glycolysis developed prior to this time and could take advantage of simple sugars being produced, but these reactions were not able to fully extract the energy stored in the carbohydrates. A later form of photosynthesis used water as a source of hydrogen ions and generated free oxygen. Over time, the atmosphere became oxygenated. Living things adapted to exploit this new atmosphere and allowed respiration as we know it to evolve. When the full process of photosynthesis as we know it developed and the atmosphere became oxygenated, cells were finally able to use the oxygen expelled by photosynthesis to extract more energy from the sugar molecules using the citric acid cycle.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-id2691963"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-id1882349">The breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids connect with the pathways of glucose catabolism.

The Greek roots of the word <em>heterotroph</em> mean “other” (<em>hetero</em>) “feeder” (<em>troph</em>), meaning that their food comes from other organisms. Even if the food organism is another animal, this food traces its origins back to autotrophs and the process of photosynthesis. Humans are heterotrophs, as are all animals. Heterotrophs depend on autotrophs, either directly or indirectly. Deer and wolves are heterotrophs. A deer obtains energy by eating plants. A wolf eating a deer obtains energy that originally came from the plants eaten by that deer. The energy in the plant came from photosynthesis, and therefore it is the only autotroph in this example (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_148" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/#attachment_148">Figure 5.3</a>).

The process of photosynthesis occurs not on the surface layers of the leaf, but rather in a middle layer called the mesophyll (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_152" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-1-overview-of-photosynthesis/#attachment_152">Figure 5.7</a>).

In plants, chloroplast-containing cells exist in the mesophyll. Chloroplasts have a double (inner and outer) membrane. Within the chloroplast is a third membrane that forms stacked, disc-shaped structures called thylakoids. Embedded in the thylakoid membrane are molecules of chlorophyll, a pigment (a molecule that absorbs light) through which the entire process of photosynthesis begins. Chlorophyll is responsible for the green color of plants. The thylakoid membrane encloses an internal space called the thylakoid space. Other types of pigments are also involved in photosynthesis, but chlorophyll is by far the most important.

In the light-dependent reactions, which take place at the thylakoid membrane, chlorophyll absorbs energy from sunlight and then converts it into chemical energy with the use of water. The light-dependent reactions release oxygen from the hydrolysis of water as a byproduct. In the Calvin cycle, which takes place in the stroma, the chemical energy derived from the light-dependent reactions drives both the capture of carbon in carbon dioxide molecules and the subsequent assembly of sugar molecules. The two reactions use carrier molecules to transport the energy from one to the other. The carriers that move energy from the light-dependent reactions to the Calvin cycle reactions can be thought of as “full” because they bring energy. After the energy is released, the “empty” energy carriers return to the light-dependent reactions to obtain more energy.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm12782656"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm26313904">The process of photosynthesis transformed life on earth.

The longer the wavelength (or the more stretched out it appears), the less energy is carried. Short, tight waves carry the most energy. This may seem illogical, but think of it in terms of a piece of moving rope. It takes little effort by a person to move a rope in long, wide waves.

In plants, pigment molecules absorb only visible light for photosynthesis. The visible light seen by humans as white light actually exists in a rainbow of colors. Certain objects, such as a prism or a drop of water, disperse white light to reveal these colors to the human eye. The visible light portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is perceived by the human eye as a rainbow of colors, with violet and blue having shorter wavelengths and, therefore, higher energy. At the other end of the spectrum toward red, the wavelengths are longer and have lower energy.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm1205728"><h1>Understanding Pigments</h1> <p id="fs-idp10105328">Different kinds of pigments exist, and each absorbs only certain wavelengths (colors) of visible light. Pigments reflect the color of the wavelengths that they cannot absorb.</p> <p id="fs-idp66921136">All photosynthetic organisms contain a pigment called chlorophyll <em>a</em>, which humans see as the common green color associated with plants. Chlorophyll <em>a</em> absorbs wavelengths from either end of the visible spectrum (blue and red), but not from green. Because green is reflected, chlorophyll appears green.</p> <p id="fs-idm30507344">Other pigment types include chlorophyll <em>b</em> (which absorbs blue and red-orange light) and the carotenoids. Each type of pigment can be identified by the specific pattern of wavelengths it absorbs from visible light, which is its absorption spectrum.</p> <p id="fs-idm31931920">Many photosynthetic organisms have a mixture of pigments; between them, the organism can absorb energy from a wider range of visible-light wavelengths. Not all photosynthetic organisms have full access to sunlight. Some organisms grow underwater where light intensity decreases with depth, and certain wavelengths are absorbed by the water. Other organisms grow in competition for light. Plants on the rainforest floor must be able to absorb any bit of light that comes through, because the taller trees block most of the sunlight (<a href="#figure5.11" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-2-the-light-dependent-reactions-of-photosynthesis/#figure5.11">Figure 5.11</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure5.11"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_158" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-158" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_05_02_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_05_02_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4474" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042.jpg" alt="This photo shows undergrowth in a forest." width="400" height="267" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_02_042-350x234.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-158">Figure 5.11 Plants that commonly grow in the shade benefit from having a variety of light-absorbing pigments.

As the electron passes along these proteins, energy from the electron fuels membrane pumps that actively move hydrogen ions against their concentration gradient from the stroma into the thylakoid space. This is quite analogous to the process that occurs in the mitochondrion in which an electron transport chain pumps hydrogen ions from the mitochondrial stroma across the inner membrane and into the intermembrane space, creating an electrochemical gradient.

The energy that these molecules carry is stored in a bond that holds a single atom to the molecule. For ATP, it is a phosphate atom, and for NADPH, it is a hydrogen atom. Recall that NADH was a similar molecule that carried energy in the mitochondrion from the citric acid cycle to the electron transport chain. When these molecules release energy into the Calvin cycle, they each lose atoms to become the lower-energy molecules ADP and NADP<sup>+</sup>.</p> <p id="fs-idp12010704">The buildup of hydrogen ions in the thylakoid space forms an electrochemical gradient because of the difference in the concentration of protons (H<sup>+</sup>) and the difference in the charge across the membrane that they create. This potential energy is harvested and stored as chemical energy in ATP through chemiosmosis, the movement of hydrogen ions down their electrochemical gradient through the transmembrane enzyme ATP synthase, just as in the mitochondrion.</p> <p id="fs-idp64631264">The hydrogen ions are allowed to pass through the thylakoid membrane through an embedded protein complex called ATP synthase. This same protein generated ATP from ADP in the mitochondrion. The energy generated by the hydrogen ion stream allows ATP synthase to attach a third phosphate to ADP, which forms a molecule of ATP in a process called photophosphorylation. The flow of hydrogen ions through ATP synthase is called chemiosmosis, because the ions move from an area of high to low concentration through a semi-permeable structure.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp95725104"><h1>Generating Another Energy Carrier: NADPH</h1> <p id="fs-idm43104512">The remaining function of the light-dependent reaction is to generate the other energy-carrier molecule, NADPH. As the electron from the electron transport chain arrives at photosystem I, it is re-energized with another photon captured by chlorophyll. The energy from this electron drives the formation of NADPH from NADP<sup>+</sup> and a hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>). Now that the solar energy is stored in energy carriers, it can be used to make a sugar molecule.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idp7118704"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm47626352">In the first part of photosynthesis, the light-dependent reaction, pigment molecules absorb energy from sunlight.

In the stroma, in addition to CO<sub>2</sub>, two other chemicals are present to initiate the Calvin cycle: an enzyme abbreviated RuBisCO, and the molecule ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). RuBP has five atoms of carbon and a phosphate group on each end.</p> <p id="fs-idp81678240">RuBisCO catalyzes a reaction between CO<sub>2</sub> and RuBP, which forms a six-carbon compound that is immediately converted into two three-carbon compounds. This process is called carbon fixation, because CO<sub>2</sub> is “fixed” from its inorganic form into organic molecules.</p> <p id="fs-idm31526560">ATP and NADPH use their stored energy to convert the three-carbon compound, 3-PGA, into another three-carbon compound called G3P. This type of reaction is called a reduction reaction, because it involves the gain of electrons. A reduction is the gain of an electron by an atom or molecule. The molecules of ADP and NAD<sup>+</sup>, resulting from the reduction reaction, return to the light-dependent reactions to be re-energized.</p> <p id="fs-idm30708480">One of the G3P molecules leaves the Calvin cycle to contribute to the formation of the carbohydrate molecule, which is commonly glucose (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub>). Because the carbohydrate molecule has six carbon atoms, it takes six turns of the Calvin cycle to make one carbohydrate molecule (one for each carbon dioxide molecule fixed).

Even between the giant tropical leaves in the rainforest and tiny cyanobacteria, the process and components of photosynthesis that use water as an electron donor remain largely the same. Photosystems function to absorb light and use electron transport chains to convert energy. The Calvin cycle reactions assemble carbohydrate molecules with this energy.</p> <p id="fs-idm63622784">However, as with all biochemical pathways, a variety of conditions leads to varied adaptations that affect the basic pattern. Photosynthesis in dry-climate plants (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch05_03_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/5-3-the-calvin-cycle/#fig-ch05_03_03">Figure 5.16</a>) has evolved with adaptations that conserve water. In the harsh dry heat, every drop of water and precious energy must be used to survive. Two adaptations have evolved in such plants. In one form, a more efficient use of CO<sub>2</sub> allows plants to photosynthesize even when CO<sub>2</sub> is in short supply, as when the stomata are closed on hot days. The other adaptation performs preliminary reactions of the Calvin cycle at night, because opening the stomata at this time conserves water due to cooler temperatures. In addition, this adaptation has allowed plants to carry out low levels of photosynthesis without opening stomata at all, an extreme mechanism to face extremely dry periods.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch05_03_03"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-165" style="width: 305px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_05_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_05_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4482" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032.jpg" alt="This photo shows a cactus." width="305" height="400" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032-229x300.jpg 229w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032-65x85.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032-225x295.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_05_03_032-350x459.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-165">Figure 5.16 Living in the harsh conditions of the desert has led plants like this cactus to evolve variations in reactions outside the Calvin cycle.

An enzyme, RuBisCO, catalyzes the fixation reaction, by combining CO<sub>2</sub> with RuBP. The resulting six-carbon compound is broken down into two three-carbon compounds, and the energy in ATP and NADPH is used to convert these molecules into G3P. One of the three-carbon molecules of G3P leaves the cycle to become a part of a carbohydrate molecule. The remaining G3P molecules stay in the cycle to be formed back into RuBP, which is ready to react with more CO<sub>2</sub>.

The mitotic phase follows interphase. Mitosis is nuclear division during which duplicated chromosomes are segregated and distributed into daughter nuclei. Usually the cell will divide after mitosis in a process called cytokinesis in which the cytoplasm is divided and two daughter cells are formed.</div></div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id1889794"><h1>Interphase</h1> <p id="fs-id2890845">During interphase, the cell undergoes normal processes while also preparing for cell division. For a cell to move from interphase to the mitotic phase, many internal and external conditions must be met. The three stages of interphase are called G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub>.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2025386"><h2>G<sub>1</sub> Phase</h2> <p id="fs-id2746045">The first stage of interphase is called the G<sub>1</sub> phase, or first gap, because little change is visible. However, during the G<sub>1</sub> stage, the cell is quite active at the biochemical level. The cell is accumulating the building blocks of chromosomal DNA and the associated proteins, as well as accumulating enough energy reserves to complete the task of replicating each chromosome in the nucleus.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2937997"><h2>S Phase</h2> <p id="fs-id1867112">Throughout interphase, nuclear DNA remains in a semi-condensed chromatin configuration. In the S phase (synthesis phase), <strong>DNA replication</strong> results in the formation of two identical copies of each chromosome—sister chromatids—that are firmly attached at the centromere region. At this stage, each chromosome is made of two sister chromatids and is a duplicated chromosome. The centrosome is duplicated during the S phase. The two centrosomes will give rise to the mitotic spindle, the apparatus that orchestrates the movement of chromosomes during mitosis. The centrosome consists of a pair of rod-like centrioles at right angles to each other. Centrioles help organize cell division. Centrioles are not present in the centrosomes of many eukaryotic species, such as plants and most fungi.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2065180"><h2>G<sub>2</sub> Phase</h2> <p id="fs-id1851098">In the G<sub>2</sub> phase, or second gap, the cell replenishes its energy stores and synthesizes the proteins necessary for chromosome manipulation. Some cell organelles are duplicated, and the cytoskeleton is dismantled to provide resources for the mitotic spindle. There may be additional cell growth during G<sub>2</sub>. The final preparations for the mitotic phase must be completed before the cell is able to enter the first stage of mitosis.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id3138185"><h1>The Mitotic Phase</h1> <p id="fs-id2310725">To make two daughter cells, the contents of the nucleus and the cytoplasm must be divided. The mitotic phase is a multistep process during which the duplicated chromosomes are aligned, separated, and moved to opposite poles of the cell, and then the cell is divided into <strong>two new identical daughter cells</strong>. The first portion of the mitotic phase, mitosis, is composed of five stages, which accomplish nuclear division. The second portion of the mitotic phase, called cytokinesis, is the physical separation of the cytoplasmic components into two daughter cells.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2084632"><h2>Mitosis</h2> <p id="fs-id2169221">Mitosis is divided into a series of phases—prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase—that result in the division of the cell nucleus (Figure 6.4).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-174" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4496" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_06_02_02-1024x8002-1.jpg" alt="This diagram shows the five phases of mitosis, and cytokinesis.

During metaphase, the centrosomes are at opposite poles of the cell. Chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate and each sister chromatid is attached to spindle fibers originating from the opposite poles. During anaphase, the centromeres split in two. The sister chromatids, which are now called chromosomes, move toward opposite poles of the cell. Certain spindle fibers lengthen, elongating the cell. During telophase, the chromosomes arrive at the opposite poles and begin to decondense. The nuclear envelope re-forms.

The kinetochore breaks apart and the sister chromatids separate. The nucleus re-forms and the cell divides.</li> </ol> <p id="fs-id2333055">During prophase, the “first phase,” several events must occur to provide access to the chromosomes in the nucleus. The nuclear envelope starts to break into small vesicles, and the Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum fragment and disperse to the periphery of the cell. The nucleolus disappears. The centrosomes begin to move to opposite poles of the cell. The microtubules that form the basis of the mitotic spindle extend between the centrosomes, pushing them farther apart as the microtubule fibers lengthen. The sister chromatids begin to coil more tightly and become visible under a light microscope.</p> <p id="fs-id2720579">During prometaphase, many processes that were begun in prophase continue to advance and culminate in the formation of a connection between the chromosomes and cytoskeleton. The remnants of the nuclear envelope disappear. The mitotic spindle continues to develop as more microtubules assemble and stretch across the length of the former nuclear area. Chromosomes become more condensed and visually discrete. Each sister chromatid attaches to spindle microtubules at the centromere via a protein complex called the kinetochore.</p> <p id="fs-id2229627">During metaphase, all of the chromosomes are aligned in a plane called the metaphase plate, or the equatorial plane, midway between the two poles of the cell. The sister chromatids are still tightly attached to each other. At this time, the chromosomes are maximally condensed.</p> <p id="fs-id2585970">During anaphase, the sister chromatids at the equatorial plane are split apart at the centromere. Each chromatid, now called a chromosome, is pulled rapidly toward the centrosome to which its microtubule was attached. The cell becomes visibly elongated as the non-kinetochore microtubules slide against each other at the metaphase plate where they overlap.</p> <p id="fs-id2629830">During telophase, all of the events that set up the duplicated chromosomes for mitosis during the first three phases are reversed. The chromosomes reach the opposite poles and begin to decondense (unravel). The mitotic spindles are broken down into monomers that will be used to assemble cytoskeleton components for each daughter cell. Nuclear envelopes form around chromosomes.</p> <div id="fs-id3016368" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-id1926803"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/divisn_newtcell2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-id2936705"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/divisn_newtcell" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/divisn_newtcell">This page of movies</a> illustrates different aspects of mitosis.

Although the stages of mitosis are similar for most eukaryotes, the process of cytokinesis is quite different for eukaryotes that have cell walls, such as plant cells.</p> <p id="fs-id3241385">In cells such as animal cells that lack cell walls, cytokinesis begins following the onset of anaphase. A contractile ring composed of actin filaments forms just inside the plasma membrane at the former metaphase plate. The actin filaments pull the equator of the cell inward, forming a fissure. This fissure, or “crack,” is called the cleavage furrow. The furrow deepens as the actin ring contracts, and eventually the membrane and cell are cleaved in two (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_176" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/6-2-the-cell-cycle/#attachment_176">Figure 6.5</a>).</p> <p id="fs-id2000713">In plant cells, a cleavage furrow is not possible because of the rigid cell walls surrounding the plasma membrane. A new cell wall must form between the daughter cells. During interphase, the Golgi apparatus accumulates enzymes, structural proteins, and glucose molecules prior to breaking up into vesicles and dispersing throughout the dividing cell. During telophase, these Golgi vesicles move on microtubules to collect at the metaphase plate. There, the vesicles fuse from the center toward the cell walls; this structure is called a cell plate. As more vesicles fuse, the cell plate enlarges until it merges with the cell wall at the periphery of the cell. Enzymes use the glucose that has accumulated between the membrane layers to build a new cell wall of cellulose. The Golgi membranes become the plasma membrane on either side of the new cell wall (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_176" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/6-2-the-cell-cycle/#attachment_176">Figure 6.5</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-176" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4498" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_06_02_032.jpg" alt="This illustration shows cytokinesis in a typical animal cell and a typical plant cell.

In humans, the frequency of cell turnover ranges from a few hours in early embryonic development to an average of two to five days for epithelial cells, or to an entire human lifetime spent in G<sub>0</sub> by specialized cells such as cortical neurons or cardiac muscle cells. There is also variation in the time that a cell spends in each phase of the cell cycle. When fast-dividing mammalian cells are grown in culture (outside the body under optimal growing conditions), the length of the cycle is approximately 24 hours. In rapidly dividing human cells with a 24-hour cell cycle, the G<sub>1</sub> phase lasts approximately 11 hours.

To prevent a compromised cell from continuing to divide, there are internal control mechanisms that operate at three main cell cycle checkpoints at which the cell cycle can be stopped until conditions are favorable.

Despite the redundancy and overlapping levels of cell-cycle control, errors occur. One of the critical processes monitored by the cell-cycle checkpoint surveillance mechanism is the proper replication of DNA during the S phase. Even when all of the cell-cycle controls are fully functional, a small percentage of replication errors (mutations) will be passed on to the daughter cells. If one of these changes to the DNA nucleotide sequence occurs within a gene, a gene mutation results. All cancers begin when a gene mutation gives rise to a faulty protein that participates in the process of cell reproduction. The change in the cell that results from the malformed protein may be minor. Even minor mistakes, however, may allow subsequent mistakes to occur more readily. Over and over, small, uncorrected errors are passed from parent cell to daughter cells and accumulate as each generation of cells produces more non-functional proteins from uncorrected DNA damage. Eventually, the pace of the cell cycle speeds up as the effectiveness of the control and repair mechanisms decreases. Uncontrolled growth of the mutated cells outpaces the growth of normal cells in the area, and a tumor can result.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2026379"><h1>Proto-oncogenes</h1> <p id="fs-id1566151">The genes that code for the <strong>positive cell-cycle regulators</strong> are called proto-oncogenes. Proto-oncogenes are normal genes that, <strong>when mutated, become oncogenes</strong>—genes that cause a cell to become cancerous. Consider what might happen to the cell cycle in a cell with a recently acquired oncogene. In most instances, the alteration of the DNA sequence will result in a less functional (or non-functional) protein. The result is detrimental to the cell and will likely prevent the cell from completing the cell cycle; however, the organism is not harmed because the mutation will not be carried forward. If a cell cannot reproduce, the mutation is not propagated and the damage is minimal. Occasionally, however, a gene mutation causes a change that increases the activity of a positive regulator. For example, a mutation that allows Cdk, a protein involved in cell-cycle regulation, to be activated before it should be could push the cell cycle past a checkpoint before all of the required conditions are met. If the resulting daughter cells are too damaged to undertake further cell divisions, the mutation would not be propagated and no harm comes to the organism. However, if the atypical daughter cells are able to divide further, the subsequent generation of cells will likely accumulate even more mutations, some possibly in additional genes that regulate the cell cycle.</p> <p id="fs-id1481948">The Cdk example is only one of many genes that are considered proto-oncogenes. In addition to the cell-cycle regulatory proteins, any protein that influences the cycle can be altered in such a way as to override cell-cycle checkpoints. Once a proto-oncogene has been altered such that there is an increase in the rate of the cell cycle, it is then called an oncogene.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id2114318"><h1>Tumor Suppressor Genes</h1> <p id="fs-id2315966">Like proto-oncogenes, many of the <strong>negative cell-cycle regulatory proteins</strong> were discovered in cells that had become cancerous. Tumor suppressor genes are genes that code for the negative regulator proteins, the type of regulator that—when activated—can prevent the cell from undergoing uncontrolled division. The collective function of the best-understood tumor suppressor gene proteins, retinoblastoma protein (RB1), p53, and p21, is to put up a roadblock to cell-cycle progress until certain events are completed. A cell that carries a mutated form of a negative regulator might not be able to halt the cell cycle if there is a problem.</p> <p id="fs-id1808505">Mutated p53 genes have been identified in more than half of all human tumor cells. This discovery is not surprising in light of the multiple roles that the p53 protein plays at the G<sub>1</sub> checkpoint. The p53 protein activates other genes whose products halt the cell cycle (allowing time for DNA repair), activates genes whose products participate in DNA repair, or activates genes that initiate cell death when DNA damage cannot be repaired. A damaged p53 gene can result in the cell behaving as if there are no mutations (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure6.8" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/6-3-cancer-and-the-cell-cycle/#figure6.8">Figure 6.8</a>). This allows cells to divide, propagating the mutation in daughter cells and allowing the accumulation of new mutations. In addition, the damaged version of p53 found in cancer cells cannot trigger cell death.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure6.8"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_181" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-181" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4504" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_06_03_012.jpg" alt="This illustration shows cell cycle regulation by p53.

For unicellular organisms, cell division is the only method to produce new individuals. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, the outcome of cell reproduction is a pair of daughter cells that are genetically identical to the parent cell. In unicellular organisms, daughter cells are individuals.</p> <p id="fs-id1295526">To achieve the outcome of identical daughter cells, some steps are essential. The genomic DNA must be replicated and then allocated into the daughter cells; the cytoplasmic contents must also be divided to give both new cells the machinery to sustain life. In bacterial cells, the genome consists of a single, circular DNA chromosome; therefore, the process of cell division is simplified. Mitosis is unnecessary because there is no nucleus or multiple chromosomes. This type of cell division is called binary fission.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id988625"><h1>Binary Fission</h1> <p id="fs-id1666738">The cell division process of prokaryotes, called binary fission, is a less complicated and <strong>much quicker process</strong> than cell division in eukaryotes. Because of the speed of bacterial cell division, populations of bacteria can grow very rapidly. The single, circular DNA chromosome of bacteria is not enclosed in a nucleus, but instead occupies a specific location, the nucleoid, within the cell. As in eukaryotes, the DNA of the nucleoid is associated with proteins that aid in packaging the molecule into a compact size. The packing proteins of bacteria are, however, related to some of the proteins involved in the chromosome compaction of eukaryotes.</p> <p id="fs-id2169785">The starting point of replication, the origin, is close to the binding site of the chromosome to the plasma membrane (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_184" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/6-4-prokaryotic-cell-division/#attachment_184">Figure 6.9</a>). Replication of the DNA is bidirectional—moving away from the origin on both strands of the DNA loop simultaneously. As the new double strands are formed, each origin point moves away from the cell-wall attachment toward opposite ends of the cell. As the cell elongates, the growing membrane aids in the transport of the chromosomes. After the chromosomes have cleared the midpoint of the elongated cell, cytoplasmic separation begins. A septum is formed between the nucleoids from the periphery toward the center of the cell. When the new cell walls are in place, the daughter cells separate.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-184" style="width: 398px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_04_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_06_04_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4508" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_06_04_01-679x10242-1.jpg" alt="This illustration shows binary fission in prokaryotes.

Prokaryotic cells, on the other hand, do not undergo mitosis and therefore have no need for a mitotic spindle. However, the FtsZ protein that plays such a vital role in prokaryotic cytokinesis is structurally and functionally very similar to tubulin, the building block of the microtubules that make up the mitotic spindle fibers that are necessary for eukaryotes. The formation of a ring composed of repeating units of a protein called FtsZ directs the partition between the nucleoids in prokaryotes. Formation of the FtsZ ring triggers the accumulation of other proteins that work together to recruit new membrane and cell-wall materials to the site. FtsZ proteins can form filaments, rings, and other three-dimensional structures resembling the way tubulin forms microtubules, centrioles, and various cytoskeleton components. In addition, both FtsZ and tubulin employ the same energy source, GTP (guanosine triphosphate), to rapidly assemble and disassemble complex structures.</p> <p id="fs-id2998651">FtsZ and tubulin are an example of homology, structures derived from the same evolutionary origins. In this example, FtsZ is presumed to be similar to the ancestor protein to both the modern FtsZ and tubulin. While both proteins are found in extant organisms, tubulin function has evolved and diversified tremendously since the evolution from its FtsZ-like prokaryotic origin. A survey of cell-division machinery in present-day unicellular eukaryotes reveals crucial intermediary steps to the complex mitotic machinery of multicellular eukaryotes.</p> <p>The mitotic spindle fibers of eukaryotes are composed of microtubules. Microtubules are polymers of the protein tubulin. The FtsZ protein active in prokaryote cell division is very similar to tubulin in the structures it can form and its energy source. Single-celled eukaryotes (such as yeast) display possible intermediary steps between FtsZ activity during binary fission in prokaryotes and the mitotic spindle in multicellular eukaryotes, during which the nucleus breaks down and is reformed.</p> <table id="tab-ch06_04_01" summary="table x.x"><caption>Mitotic Spindle Evolution</caption> <thead><tr><th></th> <th>Structure of genetic material</th> <th>Division of nuclear material</th> <th>Separation of daughter cells</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><th>Prokaryotes</th> <td>There is no nucleus.

Hippopotamuses give birth to hippopotamus calves; Monterey pine trees produce seeds from which Monterey pine seedlings emerge; and adult flamingos lay eggs that hatch into flamingo chicks. <strong><em>In kind</em> does not generally mean <em>exactly the same</em></strong>.

In multicellular organisms, the new diploid cell will then undergo mitotic cell divisions to develop into an adult organism. A type of cell division called meiosis leads to the haploid cells that are part of the sexual reproductive cycle. Sexual reproduction, specifically meiosis and fertilization, introduces variation into offspring that may account for the evolutionary success of sexual reproduction. The vast majority of eukaryotic organisms can or must employ some form of meiosis and fertilization to reproduce.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Search for Key Points in Chapter 7</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The fact that most eukaryotes reproduce sexually is evidence of its evolutionary success. In many animals, it is the only mode of reproduction. And yet, scientists recognize some real disadvantages to sexual reproduction. On the surface, offspring that are genetically identical to the parent may appear to be more advantageous. If the parent organism is successfully occupying a habitat, offspring with the same traits would be similarly successful. There is also the obvious benefit to an organism that can produce offspring by asexual budding, fragmentation, or asexual eggs. These methods of reproduction do not require another organism of the opposite sex. There is no need to expend energy finding or attracting a mate. That energy can be spent on producing more offspring. Indeed, some organisms that lead a solitary lifestyle have retained the ability to reproduce asexually. In addition, asexual populations only have female individuals, so every individual is capable of reproduction. In contrast, the males in sexual populations (half the population) are not producing offspring themselves. Because of this, an asexual population can grow twice as fast as a sexual population in theory. This means that in competition, the asexual population would have the advantage. All of these advantages to asexual reproduction, which are also disadvantages to sexual reproduction, should mean that the number of species with asexual reproduction should be more common.</div> <p id="fs-idm57108544">However, multicellular organisms that exclusively depend on asexual reproduction are exceedingly rare. Why is sexual reproduction so common? This is one of the important questions in biology and has been the focus of much research from the latter half of the twentieth century until now. A likely explanation is that the <strong>variation that sexual reproduction creates among offspring is very important</strong> to the survival and reproduction of those offspring. The only source of variation in asexual organisms is mutation. This is the ultimate source of variation in sexual organisms. In addition, those different mutations are continually reshuffled from one generation to the next when different parents combine their unique genomes, and the genes are mixed into different combinations by the process of meiosis. Meiosis is the division of the contents of the nucleus that divides the chromosomes among gametes. Variation is introduced during meiosis, as well as when the gametes combine in fertilization.</p> <div id="fs-idm42813584" class="evolution non-majors"><h3 id="fs-idp13361936">The Red Queen Hypothesis</h3> <p>There is no question that sexual reproduction provides evolutionary advantages to organisms that employ this mechanism to produce offspring. The problematic question is why, even in the face of fairly stable conditions, sexual reproduction persists when it is more difficult and produces fewer offspring for individual organisms? Variation is the outcome of sexual reproduction, but why are ongoing variations necessary? Enter the Red Queen hypothesis, first proposed by Leigh Van Valen in 1973.<sup><a href="#footnote1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-1-sexual-reproduction/#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> The concept was named in reference to the Red Queen’s race in Lewis Carroll’s book, <em>Through the Looking-Glass,</em> in which the Red Queen says one must run at full speed just to stay where one is.</p> <p id="fs-idp441040">All species coevolve with other organisms. For example, predators coevolve with their prey, and parasites coevolve with their hosts. A remarkable example of coevolution between predators and their prey is the unique coadaptation of night flying bats and their moth prey. Bats find their prey by emitting high-pitched clicks, but moths have evolved simple ears to hear these clicks so they can avoid the bats. The moths have also adapted behaviors, such as flying away from the bat when they first hear it, or dropping suddenly to the ground when the bat is upon them. Bats have evolved “quiet” clicks in an attempt to evade the moth’s hearing. Some moths have evolved the ability to respond to the bats’ clicks with their own clicks as a strategy to confuse the bats echolocation abilities.</p> <p id="fs-idm44928368">Each tiny advantage gained by favorable variation gives a species an edge over close competitors, predators, parasites, or even prey. The only method that will allow a coevolving species to keep its own share of the resources is also to continually improve its ability to survive and produce offspring. As one species gains an advantage, other species must also develop an advantage or they will be outcompeted. No single species progresses too far ahead because genetic variation among progeny of sexual reproduction provides all species with a mechanism to produce adapted individuals. Species whose individuals cannot keep up become extinct. The Red Queen’s catchphrase was, “It takes all the running you can do to stay in the same place.” This is an apt description of coevolution between competing species.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp82772960"><h1>Life Cycles of Sexually Reproducing Organisms</h1> <p id="fs-idm55323392">Fertilization and meiosis alternate in sexual life cycles. What happens between these two events depends on the organism. The process of meiosis reduces the resulting gamete’s chromosome number by half. Fertilization, the joining of two haploid gametes, restores the diploid condition. There are three main categories of life cycles in multicellular organisms: diploid-dominant, in which the multicellular diploid stage is the most obvious life stage (and there is no multicellular haploid stage), as with most animals including humans; haploid-dominant, in which the multicellular haploid stage is the most obvious life stage (and there is no multicellular diploid stage), as with all fungi and some algae; and alternation of generations, in which the two stages, haploid and diploid, are apparent to one degree or another depending on the group, as with plants and some algae.</p> <p id="fs-idm28972592">Nearly all <strong>animals employ a diploid-dominant life-cycle strategy</strong> in which the only haploid cells produced by the organism are the gametes. The gametes are produced from diploid germ cells, a special cell line that only produces gametes. Once the haploid gametes are formed, they lose the ability to divide again. There is no multicellular haploid life stage. Fertilization occurs with the fusion of two gametes, usually from different individuals, restoring the diploid state (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure7.2" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-1-sexual-reproduction/#figure7.2">Figure 7.2 </a><strong>a</strong>).</p> <div id="fs-idp170659056" class="art-connection non-majors"><div class="" id="figure7.2"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-188" style="width: 286px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_01_01abc.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_01_01abc.png"><img class="wp-image-4514" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_07_01_01abc-489x10242-1.png" alt="Part a shows the life cycle of animals.

In fungi, the diploid (2n) zygospore undergoes meiosis to form haploid (1n) spores. Mitosis of the spores occurs to form hyphae.

During sexual reproduction, specialized haploid cells from two individuals join to form a diploid zygote. The zygote immediately undergoes meiosis to form four haploid cells called spores (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure7.2" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-1-sexual-reproduction/#figure7.2">Figure 7.2 </a><strong>b</strong>).</p> <p id="fs-idp64711040">The third life-cycle type, employed by some algae and all plants, is called alternation of generations. These species have both haploid and diploid multicellular organisms as part of their life cycle. The haploid multicellular plants are called gametophytes because they produce gametes. Meiosis is not involved in the production of gametes in this case, as the organism that produces gametes is already haploid. Fertilization between the gametes forms a diploid zygote. The zygote will undergo many rounds of mitosis and give rise to a diploid multicellular plant called a sporophyte. Specialized cells of the sporophyte will undergo meiosis and produce haploid spores. The spores will develop into the gametophytes (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure7.2" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-1-sexual-reproduction/#figure7.2">Figure 7. 2 </a><strong>c</strong>).</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm40381664"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm9040912">Nearly all eukaryotes undergo sexual reproduction.

The process of <strong>meiosis produces genetically unique reproductive cells called gametes</strong>, which have half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. Fertilization, the fusion of haploid gametes from two individuals, restores the diploid condition. Thus, sexually reproducing organisms alternate between haploid and diploid stages.

If those two cells each contain one set of chromosomes, then the resulting cell contains two sets of chromosomes. The number of sets of chromosomes in a cell is called its ploidy level. Haploid cells contain one set of chromosomes. Cells containing two sets of chromosomes are called diploid. If the reproductive cycle is to continue, the diploid cell must somehow reduce its number of chromosome sets before fertilization can occur again, or there will be a continual doubling in the number of chromosome sets in every generation. So, in addition to fertilization, sexual reproduction includes a nuclear division, known as meiosis, that reduces the number of chromosome sets.</p> <p id="fs-idp152754784">Most animals and plants are <strong>diploid, containing two sets of chromosomes</strong>; in each somatic cell (the nonreproductive cells of a multicellular organism), the nucleus contains two copies of each chromosome that are referred to as homologous chromosomes. Somatic cells are sometimes referred to as “body” cells. Homologous chromosomes are matched pairs containing genes for the same traits in identical locations along their length. Diploid organisms inherit one copy of each homologous chromosome from each parent; all together, they are considered a full set of chromosomes. In animals, <strong>haploid cells containing a single copy of each homologous chromosome</strong> are found only within gametes. Gametes fuse with another haploid gamete to produce a diploid cell.</p> <p id="fs-idp17483008">The nuclear division that forms haploid cells, which is called meiosis, is related to mitosis. As you have learned, mitosis is part of a cell reproduction cycle that results in identical daughter nuclei that are also genetically identical to the original parent nucleus. In mitosis, both the parent and the daughter nuclei contain the same number of chromosome sets—diploid for most plants and animals. Meiosis employs many of the same mechanisms as mitosis. However, the starting nucleus is always diploid and the nuclei that result at the end of a meiotic cell division are haploid. To achieve the reduction in chromosome number, <strong>meiosis consists of one round of chromosome duplication and two rounds of nuclear division</strong>. Because the events that occur during each of the division stages are analogous to the events of mitosis, the same stage names are assigned. However, because there are two rounds of division, the stages are designated with a “I” or “II.” Thus, meiosis I is the first round of meiotic division and consists of prophase I, prometaphase I, and so on. Meiosis I reduces the number of chromosome sets from two to one. The genetic information is also mixed during this division to create unique recombinant chromosomes. Meiosis II, in which the second round of meiotic division takes place in a way that is similar to mitosis, includes prophase II, prometaphase II, and so on.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp54380352"><h1>Interphase</h1> <p id="fs-idm5748976">Meiosis is preceded by an interphase consisting of the G<sub>1</sub>, S, and G<sub>2</sub> phases, which are nearly identical to the phases preceding mitosis. The G<sub>1</sub> phase is the first phase of interphase and is focused on cell growth. In the S phase, the DNA of the chromosomes is replicated. Finally, in the G<sub>2</sub> phase, the cell undergoes the final preparations for meiosis.</p> <p id="fs-idm44172416">During DNA duplication of the S phase, each chromosome becomes composed of two identical copies (called sister chromatids) that are held together at the centromere until they are pulled apart during meiosis II. In an animal cell, the centrosomes that organize the microtubules of the meiotic spindle also replicate. This prepares the cell for the first meiotic phase.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm7671184"><h1>Meiosis I</h1> <p id="fs-idm34320256">Early in prophase I, the chromosomes can be seen clearly microscopically. As the nuclear envelope begins to break down, the proteins associated with homologous chromosomes bring the pair close to each other. The tight pairing of the homologous chromosomes is called <strong>synapsis</strong>. In synapsis, the genes on the chromatids of the homologous chromosomes are precisely aligned with each other. An <strong>exchange of chromosome segments</strong> between non-sister homologous chromatids occurs and is called <strong>crossing over</strong>. This process is revealed visually after the exchange as chiasmata (singular = <em>chiasma</em>) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch07_02_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-2-meiosis/#fig-ch07_02_01">Figure 7.3</a>).</p> <p id="fs-idm5744096">As prophase I progresses, the close association between homologous chromosomes begins to break down, and the chromosomes continue to condense, although the homologous chromosomes remain attached to each other at chiasmata. The number of chiasmata varies with the species and the length of the chromosome. At the end of prophase I, the pairs are held together only at chiasmata (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch07_02_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-2-meiosis/#fig-ch07_02_01">Figure 7.3</a>) and are called tetrads because the four sister chromatids of each pair of homologous chromosomes are now visible.</p> <p id="fs-idp16430352">The crossover events are the first source of genetic variation produced by meiosis. A single crossover event between homologous non-sister chromatids leads to a reciprocal exchange of equivalent DNA between a maternal chromosome and a paternal chromosome. Now, when that sister chromatid is moved into a gamete, it will carry some DNA from one parent of the individual and some DNA from the other parent. The recombinant sister chromatid has a combination of maternal and paternal genes that did not exist before the crossover.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch07_02_01"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-190" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4517" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes that are aligned. the ends of two non-sister chromatids of the homologous chromosomes cross over, and genetic material is exchanged. the non-sister chromatids between which genetic material was exchanged are called recombinant chromosomes. the other pair of non-sister chromatids that did not exchange genetic material are called non-recombinant chromosomes." width="400" height="561" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1.jpg 731w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1-65x91.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1-225x315.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_07_02_01-731x10242-1-350x490.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-190">Figure 7.3 In this illustration of the effects of crossing over, the blue chromosome came from the individual’s father and the red chromosome came from the individual’s mother.

The microtubules assembled from centrosomes at opposite poles of the cell grow toward the middle of the cell. At the end of prometaphase I, each tetrad is attached to microtubules from both poles, with one homologous chromosome attached at one pole and the other homologous chromosome attached to the other pole. The homologous chromosomes are still held together at chiasmata. In addition, the nuclear membrane has broken down entirely.</p> <p id="fs-idp93039152">During metaphase I, the homologous chromosomes are arranged in the center of the cell with the kinetochores facing opposite poles. The orientation of each pair of homologous chromosomes at the center of the cell is random.</p> <p id="fs-idm11507808">This randomness, called independent assortment, is the physical basis for the generation of the second form of genetic variation in offspring. Consider that the homologous chromosomes of a sexually reproducing organism are originally inherited as two separate sets, one from each parent. Using humans as an example, one set of 23 chromosomes is present in the egg donated by the mother. The father provides the other set of 23 chromosomes in the sperm that fertilizes the egg. In metaphase I, these pairs line up at the midway point between the two poles of the cell. Because there is an equal chance that a microtubule fiber will encounter a maternally or paternally inherited chromosome, the arrangement of the tetrads at the metaphase plate is random. Any maternally inherited chromosome may face either pole. Any paternally inherited chromosome may also face either pole. The orientation of each tetrad is independent of the orientation of the other 22 tetrads.</p> <p id="fs-idm33987088">In each cell that undergoes meiosis, the arrangement of the tetrads is different. The number of variations depends on the number of chromosomes making up a set. There are two possibilities for orientation (for each tetrad); thus, the possible number of alignments equals 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> where <em>n</em> is the number of chromosomes per set. Humans have 23 chromosome pairs, which results in over eight million (2<sup>23</sup>) possibilities. This number does not include the variability previously created in the sister chromatids by crossover. Given these two mechanisms, it is highly unlikely that any two haploid cells resulting from meiosis will have the same genetic composition (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch07_02_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-2-meiosis/#fig-ch07_02_02">Figure 7.4</a>).</p> <p id="fs-idp6039504">To summarize the genetic consequences of meiosis I: the maternal and paternal genes are recombined by crossover events occurring on each homologous pair during prophase I; in addition, the random assortment of tetrads at metaphase produces a unique combination of maternal and paternal chromosomes that will make their way into the gametes.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch07_02_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-191" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4518" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_02_02-1024x9041-1.jpg" alt="This illustration shows that, in a cell with a set of two chromosomes, four possible arrangements of chromosomes can give rise to eight different kinds of gamete.

At each pole, there is just one member of each pair of the homologous chromosomes, so only one full set of the chromosomes is present. This is why the cells are considered haploid—there is only one chromosome set, even though there are duplicate copies of the set because each homolog still consists of two sister chromatids that are still attached to each other. However, although the sister chromatids were once duplicates of the same chromosome, they are no longer identical at this stage because of crossovers.</p> <div id="fs-idp53410912" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp54136240"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/animal_meiosis2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="130" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp20916224">Review the process of meiosis, observing how chromosomes align and migrate, at <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/animal_meiosis2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/animal_meiosis2">this site</a>.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm62135744"><h1>Meiosis II</h1> <p id="fs-idp102972192">In meiosis II, the connected sister chromatids remaining in the haploid cells from meiosis I will be split to form four haploid cells.

Mitosis is a single nuclear division that results in two nuclei, usually partitioned into two new cells. The nuclei resulting from a mitotic division are genetically identical to the original. They have the same number of sets of chromosomes: one in the case of haploid cells, and two in the case of diploid cells. On the other hand, meiosis is two nuclear divisions that result in four nuclei, usually partitioned into four new cells. The nuclei resulting from meiosis are never genetically identical, and they contain one chromosome set only—this is half the number of the original cell, which was diploid.</p> <p id="fs-idp9243664">The differences in the outcomes of meiosis and mitosis occur because of differences in the behavior of the chromosomes during each process. Most of these differences in the processes occur in meiosis I, which is a very different nuclear division than mitosis. In meiosis I, the homologous chromosome pairs become associated with each other, are bound together, experience chiasmata and crossover between sister chromatids, and line up along the metaphase plate in tetrads with spindle fibers from opposite spindle poles attached to each kinetochore of a homolog in a tetrad. All of these events occur only in meiosis I, never in mitosis.</p> <p id="fs-idm2632528">Homologous chromosomes move to opposite poles during meiosis I so the number of sets of chromosomes in each nucleus-to-be is reduced from two to one. For this reason, meiosis I is referred to as a reduction division. There is no such reduction in ploidy level in mitosis.</p> <p id="fs-idm33173440">Meiosis II is much more analogous to a mitotic division. In this case, duplicated chromosomes (only one set of them) line up at the center of the cell with divided kinetochores attached to spindle fibers from opposite poles. During anaphase II, as in mitotic anaphase, the kinetochores divide and one sister chromatid is pulled to one pole and the other sister chromatid is pulled to the other pole. If it were not for the fact that there had been crossovers, the two products of each meiosis II division would be identical as in mitosis; instead, they are different because there has always been at least one crossover per chromosome. Meiosis II is not a reduction division because, although there are fewer copies of the genome in the resulting cells, there is still one set of chromosomes, as there was at the end of meiosis I.</p> <p id="fs-idp8732128">Cells produced by mitosis will function in different parts of the body as a part of growth or replacing dead or damaged cells. They may even be involved in asexual reproduction in some organisms. Cells produced by meiosis in a diploid-dominant organism such as an animal will only participate in sexual reproduction.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_194" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-194" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_02_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4521" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_02_04-1024x945-1.jpg" alt="This illustration compares meiosis and mitosis.

The process that results in haploid cells is called meiosis. Meiosis is a series of events that arrange and separate chromosomes into daughter cells. During the interphase of meiosis, each chromosome is duplicated. In meiosis, there are two rounds of nuclear division resulting in four nuclei and usually four haploid daughter cells, each with half the number of chromosomes as the parent cell. During meiosis, variation in the daughter nuclei is introduced because of crossover in prophase I and random alignment at metaphase I. The cells that are produced by meiosis are genetically unique.</p> <p id="fs-idm44807200">Meiosis and mitosis share similarities, but have distinct outcomes. Mitotic divisions are single nuclear divisions that produce daughter nuclei that are genetically identical and have the same number of chromosome sets as the original cell. Meiotic divisions are two nuclear divisions that produce four daughter nuclei that are genetically different and have one chromosome set rather than the two sets the parent cell had. The main differences between the processes occur in the first division of meiosis. The homologous chromosomes separate into different nuclei during meiosis I causing a reduction of ploidy level. The second division of meiosis is much more similar to a mitotic division.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

To observe an individual’s karyotype, a person’s cells (like white blood cells) are first collected from a blood sample or other tissue. In the laboratory, the isolated cells are stimulated to begin actively dividing. A chemical is then applied to the cells to arrest mitosis during metaphase. The cells are then fixed to a slide.</p> <p id="fs-idm1783312">The geneticist then stains chromosomes with one of several dyes to better visualize the distinct and reproducible banding patterns of each chromosome pair. Following staining, chromosomes are viewed using bright-field microscopy. An experienced cytogeneticist can identify each band. In addition to the banding patterns, chromosomes are further identified on the basis of size and centromere location. To obtain the classic depiction of the karyotype in which homologous pairs of chromosomes are aligned in numerical order from longest to shortest, the geneticist obtains a digital image, identifies each chromosome, and manually arranges the chromosomes into this pattern.</p> <p id="fs-idp88138928">At its most basic, the karyogram may reveal genetic abnormalities in which an individual has too many or too few chromosomes per cell. Examples of this are <strong>Down syndrome</strong>, which is identified by a <strong>third copy of chromosome 21</strong>, and Turner syndrome, which is characterized by the presence of only one X chromosome in women instead of two. Geneticists can also identify large deletions or insertions of DNA. For instance, Jacobsen syndrome, which involves distinctive facial features as well as heart and bleeding defects, is identified by a deletion on chromosome 11. Finally, the karyotype can pinpoint translocations, which occur when a segment of genetic material breaks from one chromosome and reattaches to another chromosome or to a different part of the same chromosome. Translocations are implicated in certain cancers, including chronic myelogenous leukemia.</p> <p id="fs-idm73954800">By observing a karyogram, geneticists can actually visualize the chromosomal composition of an individual to confirm or predict genetic abnormalities in offspring even before birth.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp23391184"><h2>Nondisjunctions, Duplications, and Deletions</h2> <p id="fs-idm89489120">Of all the chromosomal disorders, abnormalities in chromosome number are the most easily identifiable from a karyogram. Disorders of chromosome number include the duplication or loss of entire chromosomes, as well as changes in the number of complete sets of chromosomes. They are caused by <strong>nondisjunction</strong>, which occurs when pairs of homologous chromosomes or sister chromatids fail to separate during meiosis. The risk of nondisjunction increases with the age of the parents.</p> <p id="fs-idm34557616">Nondisjunction can occur during either meiosis I or II, with different results (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure7.8" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-3-errors-in-meiosis/#figure7.8">Figure 7.8</a>). If homologous chromosomes fail to separate during meiosis I, the result is two gametes that lack that chromosome and two gametes with two copies of the chromosome.

An individual with an error in chromosome number is described as aneuploid, a term that includes monosomy (loss of one chromosome) or trisomy (gain of an extraneous chromosome). Monosomic human zygotes missing any one copy of an autosome invariably fail to develop to birth because they have only one copy of essential genes. Most autosomal trisomies also fail to develop to birth; however, duplications of some of the smaller chromosomes (13, 15, 18, 21, or 22) can result in offspring that survive for several weeks to many years. Trisomic individuals suffer from a different type of genetic imbalance: an excess in gene dose. Cell functions are calibrated to the amount of gene product produced by two copies (doses) of each gene; adding a third copy (dose) disrupts this balance. The most common trisomy is that of chromosome 21, which leads to Down syndrome. Individuals with this inherited disorder have characteristic physical features and developmental delays in growth and cognition. The incidence of Down syndrome is correlated with maternal age, such that older women are more likely to give birth to children with Down syndrome (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch07_03_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-3-errors-in-meiosis/#fig-ch07_03_03">Figure 7.9</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch07_03_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-199" style="width: 546px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4527 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_03_03.jpg" alt="This graph shows the risk of Down’s syndrome in the fetus by maternal age.

Therefore, it may seem counterintuitive that human females and males can function normally, despite carrying different numbers of the X chromosome. In part, this occurs because of a process called X inactivation. Early in development, when female mammalian embryos consist of just a few thousand cells, one X chromosome in each cell inactivates by condensing into a structure called a Barr body. The genes on the inactive X chromosome are not expressed. The particular X chromosome (maternally or paternally derived) that is inactivated in each cell is random, but once the inactivation occurs, all cells descended from that cell will have the same inactive X chromosome. By this process, females compensate for their double genetic dose of X chromosome.</p> <p id="fs-idm73303328">In so-called “tortoiseshell” cats, X inactivation is observed as coat-color variegation (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure7.10" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-3-errors-in-meiosis/#figure7.10">Figure 7.10</a>). Females heterozygous for an X-linked coat color gene will express one of two different coat colors over different regions of their body, corresponding to whichever X chromosome is inactivated in the embryonic cell progenitor of that region. When you see a tortoiseshell cat, you will know that it has to be a female.</p> <div id="figure7.10"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-201" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_07_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4529" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_03_04-270x300-1.jpg" alt="Photo of a tortoiseshell cat." width="400" height="445" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_03_04-270x300-1.jpg 270w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_03_04-270x300-1-65x72.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_07_03_04-270x300-1-225x250.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-201">Figure 7.10 Embryonic inactivation of one of two different X chromosomes encoding different coat colors gives rise to the tortoiseshell phenotype in cats.

As a result, X-chromosomal abnormalities are typically associated with mild mental and physical defects, as well as sterility. If the X chromosome is absent altogether, the individual will not develop.</p> <p id="fs-idp118840624">Several errors in sex chromosome number have been characterized. Individuals with three X chromosomes, called triplo-X, appear female but express developmental delays and reduced fertility. The XXY chromosome complement, corresponding to one type of Klinefelter syndrome, corresponds to male individuals with small testes, enlarged breasts, and reduced body hair. The extra X chromosome undergoes inactivation to compensate for the excess genetic dosage. Turner syndrome, characterized as an X0 chromosome complement (i.e., only a single sex chromosome), corresponds to a female individual with short stature, webbed skin in the neck region, hearing and cardiac impairments, and sterility.</p> <p id="fs-idp56524688">An individual with more than the correct number of chromosome sets (two for diploid species) is called polyploid. For instance, fertilization of an abnormal diploid egg with a normal haploid sperm would yield a triploid zygote. Polyploid animals are extremely rare, with only a few examples among the flatworms, crustaceans, amphibians, fish, and lizards. Triploid animals are sterile because meiosis cannot proceed normally with an odd number of chromosome sets. In contrast, polyploidy is very common in the plant kingdom, and polyploid plants tend to be larger and more robust than euploids of their species.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm46725968"><h1>Chromosome Structural Rearrangements</h1> <p id="fs-idm26650272">Cytologists have characterized numerous structural rearrangements in chromosomes, including partial duplications, deletions, inversions, and translocations.

Unless they disrupt a gene sequence, inversions only change the orientation of genes and are likely to have more mild effects than aneuploid errors.</p> <div id="fs-idm22875920" class="evolution non-majors"><h2>Evolution in Action</h2> <p id="fs-idp36827648">The Chromosome 18 InversionNot all structural rearrangements of chromosomes produce nonviable, impaired, or infertile individuals. In rare instances, such a change can result in the evolution of a new species. In fact, an inversion in chromosome 18 appears to have contributed to the evolution of humans. This inversion is not present in our closest genetic relatives, the chimpanzees.</p> <p id="fs-idm135903040">The chromosome 18 inversion is believed to have occurred in early humans following their divergence from a common ancestor with chimpanzees approximately five million years ago. Researchers have suggested that a long stretch of DNA was duplicated on chromosome 18 of an ancestor to humans, but that during the duplication it was inverted (inserted into the chromosome in reverse orientation.</p> <p id="fs-idm34184224">A comparison of human and chimpanzee genes in the region of this inversion indicates that two genes—<em>ROCK1</em> and <em>USP14</em>—are farther apart on human chromosome 18 than they are on the corresponding chimpanzee chromosome. This suggests that one of the inversion breakpoints occurred between these two genes. Interestingly, humans and chimpanzees express <em>USP14</em> at distinct levels in specific cell types, including cortical cells and fibroblasts. Perhaps the chromosome 18 inversion in an ancestral human repositioned specific genes and reset their expression levels in a useful way. Because both <em>ROCK1</em> and <em>USP14</em> code for enzymes, a change in their expression could alter cellular function. It is not known how this inversion contributed to hominid evolution, but it appears to be a significant factor in the divergence of humans from other primates.<sup><a href="#footnote1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/7-3-errors-in-meiosis/#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup></p> </div> <p id="fs-idm61482512">A translocation occurs when a segment of a chromosome dissociates and reattaches to a different, nonhomologous chromosome.

Disorders in chromosome number, or aneuploidies, are typically lethal to the embryo, although a few trisomic genotypes are viable. Because of X inactivation, aberrations in sex chromosomes typically have milder effects on an individual. Aneuploidies also include instances in which segments of a chromosome are duplicated or deleted. Chromosome structures also may be rearranged, for example by inversion or translocation. Both of these aberrations can result in negative effects on development, or death. Because they force chromosomes to assume contorted pairings during meiosis I, inversions and translocations are often associated with reduced fertility because of the likelihood of nondisjunction.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Because of Mendel’s work, the fundamental principles of heredity were revealed. We now know that genes, carried on chromosomes, are the basic functional units of heredity with the ability to be replicated, expressed, or mutated. Today, the postulates put forth by Mendel form the basis of classical, or Mendelian, genetics. Not all genes are transmitted from parents to offspring according to Mendelian genetics, but Mendel’s experiments serve as an excellent starting point for thinking about inheritance.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Search for Key Points in Chapter 8</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

As a young adult, he joined the Augustinian Abbey of St. Thomas in Brno in what is now the Czech Republic. Supported by the monastery, he taught physics, botany, and natural science courses at the secondary and university levels. In 1856, he began a decade-long research pursuit involving inheritance patterns in honeybees and plants, ultimately settling on pea plants as his primary model system (a system with convenient characteristics that is used to study a specific biological phenomenon to gain understanding to be applied to other systems). In 1865, Mendel presented the results of his experiments with nearly <strong>30,000 pea plants</strong> to the local natural history society. He demonstrated that traits are transmitted faithfully from parents to offspring in specific patterns. In 1866, he published his work, <em>Experiments in Plant Hybridization,</em><sup><a href="#footnote1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-1-mendels-experiments/#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup> in the proceedings of the Natural History Society of Brünn.</p> <p id="fs-idm22619440">Mendel’s work went virtually unnoticed by the scientific community, which incorrectly believed that the process of inheritance involved a <strong>blending</strong> of parental traits that produced an intermediate physical appearance in offspring. This hypothetical process appeared to be correct because of what we know now as continuous variation. Continuous variation is the range of small differences we see among individuals in a characteristic like human height. It does appear that offspring are a “blend” of their parents’ traits when we look at characteristics that exhibit continuous variation. Mendel worked instead with traits that show <strong>discontinuous variation</strong>. Discontinuous variation is the variation seen among individuals when each individual shows one of two—or a very few—easily distinguishable traits, such as violet or white flowers. Mendel’s choice of these kinds of traits allowed him to see experimentally that the traits were not blended in the offspring as would have been expected at the time, but that they were inherited as distinct traits. In 1868, Mendel became abbot of the monastery and exchanged his scientific pursuits for his pastoral duties. He was not recognized for his extraordinary scientific contributions during his lifetime; in fact, it was not until 1900 that his work was rediscovered, reproduced, and revitalized by scientists on the brink of discovering the chromosomal basis of heredity.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm118717328"><h1>Mendel’s Crosses</h1> <p id="fs-idp13388432">Mendel’s seminal work was accomplished using the <strong>garden pea</strong>, <em>Pisum sativum</em>, to study inheritance. This species naturally <strong>self-fertilizes</strong>, meaning that pollen encounters ova within the same flower. The flower petals remain sealed tightly until pollination is completed to prevent the pollination of other plants. The result is highly inbred, or “true-breeding,” pea plants. These are plants that always produce offspring that look like the parent. By experimenting with true-breeding pea plants, Mendel avoided the appearance of unexpected traits in offspring that might occur if the plants were not true breeding. The garden pea also grows to maturity within one season, meaning that several generations could be evaluated over a relatively short time. Finally, large quantities of garden peas could be cultivated simultaneously, allowing Mendel to conclude that his results did not come about simply by chance.</p> <p id="fs-idm44829088">Mendel performed hybridizations, which involve <strong>mating two true-breeding individuals</strong> that have different traits. In the pea, which is naturally self-pollinating, this is done by manually transferring pollen from the anther of a mature pea plant of one variety to the stigma of a separate mature pea plant of the second variety.</p> <p id="fs-idm58952480">Plants used in first-generation crosses were called <strong>P, or parental generation</strong>, plants (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.3" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-1-mendels-experiments/#figure8.3">Figure 8.3</a>). Mendel collected the seeds produced by the P plants that resulted from each cross and grew them the following season. These offspring were called the F<sub>1</sub>, or the first filial (filial = daughter or son), generation. Once Mendel examined the characteristics in the <strong>F<sub>1</sub> generation of plants</strong>, he allowed them to self-fertilize naturally. He then collected and grew the seeds from the F<sub>1</sub> plants to produce the F<sub>2</sub>, or second filial, generation. Mendel’s experiments extended beyond the <strong>F<sub>2</sub> generation</strong> to the F<sub>3</sub> generation, F<sub>4 </sub>generation, and so on, but it was the ratio of characteristics in the P, F<sub>1</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub> generations that were the most intriguing and became the basis of Mendel’s postulates.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.3"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-208" style="width: 303px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4538" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_01_02-518x1024-1.jpg" alt="The diagram shows a cross between pea plants that are true-breeding for purple flower color and plants that are true-breeding for white flower color.

A trait is defined as a variation in the physical appearance of a heritable characteristic. The characteristics included plant height, seed texture, seed color, flower color, pea-pod size, pea-pod color, and flower position. For the characteristic of flower color, for example, the two contrasting traits were white versus violet. To fully examine each characteristic, Mendel generated large numbers of F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> plants and reported results from thousands of F<sub>2</sub> plants.</p> <p id="fs-idm25428784">What results did Mendel find in his crosses for flower color? First, Mendel confirmed that he was using plants that bred true for white or violet flower color. Irrespective of the number of generations that Mendel examined, all self-crossed offspring of parents with white flowers had white flowers, and all self-crossed offspring of parents with violet flowers had violet flowers. In addition, Mendel confirmed that, other than flower color, the pea plants were physically identical. This was an important check to make sure that the two varieties of pea plants only differed with respect to one trait, flower color.</p> <p id="fs-idm29246448">Once these validations were complete, Mendel applied the pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers. After gathering and sowing the seeds that resulted from this cross, Mendel found that <strong>100 percent of the F<sub>1</sub></strong> hybrid generation had violet flowers. Conventional wisdom at that time would have predicted the hybrid flowers to be pale violet or for hybrid plants to have equal numbers of white and violet flowers. In other words, the contrasting parental traits were expected to blend in the offspring. Instead, Mendel’s results demonstrated that the white flower trait had completely disappeared in the F<sub>1</sub> generation.</p> <p id="fs-idm23155792">Importantly, Mendel did not stop his experimentation there. He allowed the F<sub>1</sub> plants to self-fertilize and found that 705 plants in the <strong>F<sub>2</sub></strong>generation had violet flowers and 224 had white flowers. This was a ratio of 3.15 violet flowers to one white flower, or <strong>approximately 3:1</strong>. When Mendel transferred pollen from a plant with violet flowers to the stigma of a plant with white flowers and vice versa, he obtained approximately the same ratio irrespective of which parent—male or female—contributed which trait. This is called a <strong>reciprocal cross</strong>—a paired cross in which the respective traits of the male and female in one cross become the respective traits of the female and male in the other cross. For the other six characteristics that Mendel examined, the F<sub>1</sub> and F<sub>2</sub> generations behaved in the same way that they behaved for flower color. One of the two traits would disappear completely from the F<sub>1</sub> generation, only to reappear in the F<sub>2</sub> generation at a ratio of roughly 3:1 (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch08_01_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-1-mendels-experiments/#fig-ch08_01_03">Figure 8.4</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch08_01_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-209" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4539" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_01_03-1024x724-1.jpg" alt="Seven characteristics of Mendel’s pea plants are illustrated.

He called these <strong>dominant and recessive traits</strong>, respectively. Dominant traits are those that are inherited unchanged in a hybridization. Recessive traits become latent, or disappear in the offspring of a hybridization. The recessive trait does, however, reappear in the progeny of the hybrid offspring. An example of a dominant trait is the violet-colored flower trait. For this same characteristic (flower color), white-colored flowers are a recessive trait. The fact that the recessive trait reappeared in the F<sub>2</sub> generation meant that the traits remained separate (and were not blended) in the plants of the F<sub>1</sub> generation. Mendel proposed that this was because the plants possessed two copies of the trait for the flower-color characteristic, and that each parent transmitted one of their two copies to their offspring, where they came together. Moreover, the physical observation of a dominant trait could mean that the genetic composition of the organism included two dominant versions of the characteristic, or that it included one dominant and one recessive version. Conversely, the observation of a recessive trait meant that the organism lacked any dominant versions of this characteristic.</p> <div id="fs-idm64307120" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idm35750816"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/mendels_peas2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idm34669488">For an excellent review of Mendel’s experiments and to perform your own crosses and identify patterns of inheritance, visit the <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/mendels_peas">Mendel’s Peas</a> web lab.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idp33818496"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp3169504">Working with garden pea plants, Mendel found that crosses between parents that differed for one trait produced F<sub>1</sub> offspring that all expressed one parent’s traits.

Mendel deduced from his results that each individual had two discrete copies of the characteristic that are passed individually to offspring. We now call those two copies <strong>genes</strong>, which are carried on chromosomes. The reason we have two copies of each gene is that we inherit one from each parent. In fact, it is the chromosomes we inherit and the two copies of each gene are located on paired chromosomes. Recall that in meiosis these chromosomes are separated out into haploid gametes. This <strong>separation, or segregation</strong>, of the homologous chromosomes means also that only one of the copies of the gene gets moved into a gamete. The offspring are formed when that gamete unites with one from another parent and the two copies of each gene (and chromosome) are restored.</p> <p id="fs-idp8399888">For cases in which a single gene controls a single characteristic, a diploid organism has two genetic copies that may or may not encode the same version of that characteristic. For example, one individual may carry a gene that determines white flower color and a gene that determines violet flower color. Gene variants that arise by mutation and exist at the same relative locations on homologous chromosomes are called <strong>alleles</strong>. Mendel examined the inheritance of genes with just two allele forms, but it is common to encounter more than two alleles for any given gene in a natural population.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp91312"><h1>Phenotypes and Genotypes</h1> <p id="fs-idp353872">Two alleles for a given gene in a diploid organism are expressed and interact to produce physical characteristics. The observable traits expressed by an organism are referred to as its <strong>phenotype</strong>. An organism’s underlying genetic makeup, consisting of both the physically visible and the non-expressed alleles, is called its <strong>genotype</strong>. Mendel’s hybridization experiments demonstrate the difference between phenotype and genotype. For example, the phenotypes that Mendel observed in his crosses between pea plants with differing traits are connected to the diploid genotypes of the plants in the P, F<sub>1</sub>, and F<sub>2</sub> generations. We will use a second trait that Mendel investigated, seed color, as an example. Seed color is governed by a single gene with two alleles. The yellow-seed allele is dominant and the green-seed allele is recessive. When true-breeding plants were cross-fertilized, in which one parent had yellow seeds and one had green seeds, all of the F<sub>1</sub> hybrid offspring had yellow seeds. That is, the hybrid offspring were phenotypically identical to the true-breeding parent with yellow seeds. However, we know that the allele donated by the parent with green seeds was not simply lost because it reappeared in some of the F<sub>2</sub> offspring (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-2-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.5">Figure 8.5</a>). Therefore, the F<sub>1</sub> plants must have been genotypically different from the parent with yellow seeds.</p> <p id="fs-idp100656">The P plants that Mendel used in his experiments were each <strong>homozygous</strong> for the trait he was studying. Diploid organisms that are homozygous for a gene have two identical alleles, one on each of their homologous chromosomes. The genotype is often written as <em>YY</em> or <em>yy</em>, for which each letter represents one of the two alleles in the genotype. The dominant allele is capitalized and the recessive allele is lower case. The letter used for the gene (seed color in this case) is usually related to the dominant trait (yellow allele, in this case, or “<em>Y</em>”). Mendel’s parental pea plants always bred true because both produced gametes carried the same allele. When P plants with contrasting traits were cross-fertilized, all of the offspring were <strong>heterozygous</strong> for the contrasting trait, meaning their genotype had different alleles for the gene being examined. For example, the F<sub>1</sub> yellow plants that received a <em>Y</em> allele from their yellow parent and a <em>y</em> allele from their green parent had the genotype <em>Yy</em>.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.5"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_212" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-212" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4543" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01.jpg" alt="By the end of this section, you will be able to: Explain the relationship between genotypes and phenotypes in dominant and recessive gene systems Use a Punnett square to calculate the expected proportions of genotypes and phenotypes in a monohybrid cross Explain Mendel’s law of segregation and independent assortment in terms of genetics and the events of meiosis Explain the purpose and methods of a test cross" width="500" height="342" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01-300x205.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01-768x525.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01-65x44.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01-225x154.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_02_01-350x239.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-212">Figure 8.5 Phenotypes are physical expressions of traits that are transmitted by alleles.

In all seven pea-plant characteristics, one of the two contrasting alleles was dominant, and the other was recessive. Mendel called the dominant allele the expressed unit factor; the recessive allele was referred to as the latent unit factor. We now know that these so-called unit factors are actually genes on homologous chromosomes. For a gene that is expressed in a dominant and recessive pattern, homozygous dominant and heterozygous organisms will look identical (that is, they will have different genotypes but the same phenotype), and the recessive allele will only be observed in homozygous recessive individuals.</p> <table id="tab-ch08_02_01" summary=""><caption>Correspondence between Genotype and Phenotype for a Dominant-Recessive Characteristic.</caption> <thead><tr><th></th> <th>Homozygous</th> <th>Heterozygous</th> <th>Homozygous</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>Genotype</td> <td><em>YY</em></td> <td><em>Yy</em></td> <td><em>yy</em></td> </tr> <tr><td>Phenotype</td> <td>yellow</td> <td>yellow</td> <td>green</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id="fs-idp6144">Mendel’s law of dominance states that in a heterozygote, one trait will conceal the presence of another trait for the same characteristic. For example, when crossing true-breeding violet-flowered plants with true-breeding white-flowered plants, all of the offspring were violet-flowered, even though they all had one allele for violet and one allele for white. Rather than both alleles contributing to a phenotype, the dominant allele will be expressed exclusively. The recessive allele will remain latent, but will be transmitted to offspring in the same manner as that by which the dominant allele is transmitted. The recessive trait will only be expressed by offspring that have two copies of this allele (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.6" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-2-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.6">Figure 8.6</a>), and these offspring will breed true when self-crossed.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.6"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-213" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4544" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02.jpg" alt="Photo shows a mother with an albino child." width="400" height="500" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02-240x300.jpg 240w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02-65x81.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02-225x281.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_02-350x438.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-213">Figure 8.6 The allele for albinism, expressed here in humans, is recessive.

Mendel performed seven types of monohybrid crosses, each involving contrasting traits for different characteristics. Out of these crosses, all of the F<sub>1</sub> offspring had the phenotype of one parent, and the F<sub>2</sub> offspring had a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. On the basis of these results, Mendel postulated that each parent in the monohybrid cross contributed one of two paired unit factors to each offspring, and every possible combination of unit factors was equally likely.</p> <p id="fs-idp7191648">The results of Mendel’s research can be explained in terms of probabilities, which are mathematical measures of likelihood. The probability of an event is calculated by the number of times the event occurs divided by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. A probability of one (100 percent) for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero (0 percent) indicates that it is guaranteed to not occur, and a probability of 0.5 (50 percent) means it has an equal chance of occurring or not occurring.</p> <p id="fs-idp7192032">To demonstrate this with a monohybrid cross, consider the case of true-breeding pea plants with yellow versus green seeds. The dominant seed color is yellow; therefore, the parental genotypes were <em>YY </em>for the plants with yellow seeds and <em>yy</em> for the plants with green seeds. A Punnett square, devised by the British geneticist Reginald Punnett, is useful for determining probabilities because it is drawn to predict all possible outcomes of all possible random fertilization events and their expected frequencies. <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.9" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-2-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.9">Figure 8.9</a> shows a Punnett square for a cross between a plant with yellow peas and one with green peas. To prepare a Punnett square, all possible combinations of the parental alleles (the genotypes of the gametes) are listed along the top (for one parent) and side (for the other parent) of a grid. The combinations of egg and sperm gametes are then made in the boxes in the table on the basis of which alleles are combining. Each box then represents the diploid genotype of a zygote, or fertilized egg. Because each possibility is equally likely, genotypic ratios can be determined from a Punnett square. If the pattern of inheritance (dominant and recessive) is known, the phenotypic ratios can be inferred as well. For a monohybrid cross of two true-breeding parents, each parent contributes one type of allele. In this case, only one genotype is possible in the F<sub>1</sub> offspring. All offspring are <em>Yy</em> and have yellow seeds.</p> <p id="fs-idp90112">When the F<sub>1 </sub>offspring are crossed with each other, each has an equal probability of contributing either a <em>Y</em> or a <em>y</em> to the F<sub>2</sub> offspring. The result is a 1 in 4 (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <em>Y</em>, resulting in an offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <em>Y</em> and parent B a <em>y</em>, resulting in offspring with a yellow phenotype; a 25 percent probability of parent A contributing a <em>y</em> and parent B a <em>Y</em>, also resulting in a yellow phenotype; and a (25 percent) probability of both parents contributing a <em>y</em>, resulting in a green phenotype. When counting all four possible outcomes, there is a 3 in 4 probability of offspring having the yellow phenotype and a 1 in 4 probability of offspring having the green phenotype. This explains why the results of Mendel’s F<sub>2</sub> generation occurred in a 3:1 phenotypic ratio. Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities, found that they fit the model of inheritance, and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp8393424"><h1>Law of Segregation</h1> <p id="fs-idp315728">Observing that true-breeding pea plants with contrasting traits gave rise to F<sub>1</sub> generations that all expressed the dominant trait and F<sub>2</sub> generations that expressed the dominant and recessive traits in a 3:1 ratio, Mendel proposed the law of segregation. This law states that <strong>paired unit factors (genes) must segregate equally into gametes</strong> such that offspring have an equal likelihood of inheriting either factor. For the F<sub>2</sub> generation of a monohybrid cross, the following three possible combinations of genotypes result: homozygous dominant, heterozygous, or homozygous recessive. Because heterozygotes could arise from two different pathways (receiving one dominant and one recessive allele from either parent), and because heterozygotes and homozygous dominant individuals are phenotypically identical, the law supports Mendel’s observed 3:1 phenotypic ratio. The equal segregation of alleles is the reason we can apply the Punnett square to accurately predict the offspring of parents with known genotypes. The physical basis of Mendel’s law of segregation is the first division of meiosis in which the homologous chromosomes with their different versions of each gene are segregated into daughter nuclei. This process was not understood by the scientific community during Mendel’s lifetime (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.7" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-2-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.7">Figure 8.7</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.7"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_214" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-214" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4545" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_02_03.jpg" alt="Homologous pairs of chromosomes line up at the metaphase plate during metaphase I of meiosis.

For example, a gamete could get an <em>R</em> allele for the seed shape gene and either a <em>Y</em> or a <em>y</em> allele for the seed color gene. It cannot get both an <em>R</em> and an <em>r</em> allele; each gamete can have only one allele per gene. The law of independent assortment states that a gamete into which an <em>r</em> allele is sorted would be equally likely to contain either a <em>Y</em> or a <em>y</em> allele. Thus, there are four equally likely gametes that can be formed when the <em>RrYy</em> heterozygote is self-crossed, as follows: <em>RY</em>, <em>rY</em>, <em>Ry</em>, and <em>ry</em>. Arranging these gametes along the top and left of a 4 × 4 Punnett square gives us 16 equally likely genotypic combinations.

The empirical probability of an event is calculated by dividing the number of times the event occurs by the total number of opportunities for the event to occur. It is also possible to calculate theoretical probabilities by dividing the number of times that an event is expected to occur by the number of times that it could occur. Empirical probabilities come from observations, like those of Mendel. Theoretical probabilities come from knowing how the events are produced and assuming that the probabilities of individual outcomes are equal. A probability of one for some event indicates that it is guaranteed to occur, whereas a probability of zero indicates that it is guaranteed not to occur. An example of a genetic event is a round seed produced by a pea plant. In his experiment, Mendel demonstrated that the probability of the event “round seed” occurring was one in the F<sub>1</sub> offspring of true-breeding parents, one of which has round seeds and one of which has wrinkled seeds. When the F<sub>1</sub> plants were subsequently self-crossed, the probability of any given F<sub>2</sub> offspring having round seeds was now three out of four. In other words, in a large population of F<sub>2</sub> offspring chosen at random, 75 percent were expected to have round seeds, whereas 25 percent were expected to have wrinkled seeds. Using large numbers of crosses, Mendel was able to calculate probabilities and use these to predict the outcomes of other crosses.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-id1805576"><h2>The Product Rule and Sum Rule</h2> <p id="fs-id1798638">Mendel demonstrated that the pea-plant characteristics he studied were transmitted as discrete units from parent to offspring. As will be discussed, Mendel also determined that different characteristics, like seed color and seed texture, were transmitted independently of one another and could be considered in separate probability analyses. For instance, performing a cross between a plant with green, wrinkled seeds and a plant with yellow, round seeds still produced offspring that had a 3:1 ratio of green:yellow seeds (ignoring seed texture) and a 3:1 ratio of round:wrinkled seeds (ignoring seed color). The characteristics of color and texture did not influence each other.</p> <p id="fs-id1780876">The product rule of probability can be applied to this phenomenon of the independent transmission of characteristics. The product rule states that the probability of two independent events occurring together can be calculated by multiplying the individual probabilities of each event occurring alone. To demonstrate the product rule, imagine that you are rolling a six-sided die (D) and flipping a penny (P) at the same time. The die may roll any number from 1–6 (D<sub>#</sub>), whereas the penny may turn up heads (P<sub>H</sub>) or tails (P<sub>T</sub>). The outcome of rolling the die has no effect on the outcome of flipping the penny and vice versa. There are 12 possible outcomes of this action, and each event is expected to occur with equal probability.</p> <table id="tab-ch12-01-02" summary=""><caption>Twelve Equally Likely Outcomes of Rolling a Die and Flipping a Penny</caption> <thead><tr><th>Rolling Die</th> <th>Flipping Penny</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>D<sub>1</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>1</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>2</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>2</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>3</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>3</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>4</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>4</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>5</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>5</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>6</sub></td> <td>P<sub>H</sub></td> </tr> <tr><td>D<sub>6</sub></td> <td>P<sub>T</sub></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p id="fs-id2316750">Of the 12 possible outcomes, the die has a 2/12 (or 1/6) probability of rolling a two, and the penny has a 6/12 (or 1/2) probability of coming up heads. By the product rule, the probability that you will obtain the combined outcome 2 and heads is: (D<sub>2</sub>) x (P<sub>H</sub>) = (1/6) x (1/2) or 1/12. Notice the word “and” in the description of the probability. The “and” is a signal to apply the product rule. For example, consider how the product rule is applied to the dihybrid cross: the probability of having both dominant traits in the F<sub>2</sub> progeny is the product of the probabilities of having the dominant trait for each characteristic, as shown here:</p> <div id="eip-772"><div class="MathJax_Display" style="text-align: center"><span id="MathJax-Element-1-Frame" class="MathJax"><span id="MathJax-Span-1" class="math"><span id="MathJax-Span-2" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-3" class="semantics"><span id="MathJax-Span-4" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-5" class="mrow"><span id="MathJax-Span-6" class="mfrac"><span id="MathJax-Span-7" class="mn">3</span>/4</span><span id="MathJax-Span-10" class="mo">×</span><span id="MathJax-Span-12" class="mfrac"><span id="MathJax-Span-13" class="mn">3</span>/4</span><span id="MathJax-Span-16" class="mo">=</span><span id="MathJax-Span-18" class="mtext">​</span><span id="MathJax-Span-19" class="mfrac"><span id="MathJax-Span-20" class="mn">9/16</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></div> </div> <p id="fs-id1512071">On the other hand, the sum rule of probability is applied when considering two mutually exclusive outcomes that can come about by more than one pathway. The sum rule states that the probability of the occurrence of one event or the other event, of two mutually exclusive events, is the sum of their individual probabilities. Notice the word “or” in the description of the probability. The “or” indicates that you should apply the sum rule. In this case, let’s imagine you are flipping a penny (P) and a quarter (Q). What is the probability of one coin coming up heads and one coin coming up tails? This outcome can be achieved by two cases: the penny may be heads (P<sub>H</sub>) and the quarter may be tails (Q<sub>T</sub>), or the quarter may be heads (Q<sub>H</sub>) and the penny may be tails (P<sub>T</sub>). Either case fulfills the outcome.

You should also notice that we used the product rule to calculate the probability of P<sub>H</sub> and Q<sub>T</sub>, and also the probability of P<sub>T</sub> and Q<sub>H</sub>, before we summed them.

If the traits are inherited as dominant and recessive, the F<sub>1</sub> offspring will all exhibit the same phenotype as the parent homozygous for the dominant trait. If these heterozygous offspring are self-crossed, the resulting F<sub>2</sub> offspring will be equally likely to inherit gametes carrying the dominant or recessive trait, giving rise to offspring of which one quarter are homozygous dominant, half are heterozygous, and one quarter are homozygous recessive. Because homozygous dominant and heterozygous individuals are phenotypically identical, the observed traits in the F<sub>2</sub> offspring will exhibit a ratio of three dominant to one recessive.</p> <p id="fs-idp8297328">Mendel postulated that genes (characteristics) are inherited as pairs of alleles (traits) that behave in a dominant and recessive pattern. Alleles segregate into gametes such that each gamete is equally likely to receive either one of the two alleles present in a diploid individual. In addition, genes are assorted into gametes independently of one another. That is, in general, alleles are not more likely to segregate into a gamete with a particular allele of another gene.</p> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The inheritance of the traits he studied all followed the relatively simple pattern of dominant and recessive alleles for a single characteristic. There are several important modes of inheritance, discovered after Mendel’s work, that do not follow the dominant and recessive, single-gene model.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp78603952"><h1>Alternatives to Dominance and Recessiveness</h1> <p id="fs-idm289984">Mendel’s experiments with pea plants suggested that: 1) two types of “units” or alleles exist for every gene; 2) alleles maintain their integrity in each generation (no blending); and 3) in the presence of the dominant allele, the recessive allele is hidden, with no contribution to the phenotype. Therefore, recessive alleles can be “carried” and not expressed by individuals. Such heterozygous individuals are sometimes referred to as “carriers.” Since then, genetic studies in other organisms have shown that much more complexity exists, but that the fundamental principles of Mendelian genetics still hold true. In the sections to follow, we consider some of the extensions of Mendelism.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp49789648"><h2>Incomplete Dominance</h2> <p id="fs-idp49914672">Mendel’s results, demonstrating that traits are inherited as dominant and recessive pairs, contradicted the view at that time that offspring exhibited a blend of their parents’ traits. However, the heterozygote phenotype occasionally does appear to be intermediate between the two parents. For example, in the snapdragon, <em>Antirrhinum majus</em> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.13" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.13">Figure 8.13</a>), a cross between a homozygous parent with <strong>white flowers (<em>C<sup>W</sup>C<sup>W</sup></em>)</strong> and a homozygous parent with <strong>red flowers (<em>C<sup>R</sup>C<sup>R</sup></em>)</strong> will produce <strong>offspring with pink flowers (<em>C<sup>R</sup>C<sup>W</sup></em>)</strong>. (Note that different genotypic abbreviations are used for Mendelian extensions to distinguish these patterns from simple dominance and recessiveness.) This pattern of inheritance is described as incomplete dominance, meaning that one of the alleles appears in the phenotype in the heterozygote, but not to the exclusion of the other, which can also be seen. The allele for red flowers is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. However, the results of a heterozygote self-cross can still be predicted, just as with Mendelian dominant and recessive crosses. In this case, the genotypic ratio would be 1 <em>C<sup>R</sup>C<sup>R</sup></em>:2 <em>C<sup>R</sup>C<sup>W</sup></em>:1 <em>C<sup>W</sup>C<sup>W</sup></em>, and the phenotypic ratio would be 1:2:1 for red:pink:white. The basis for the intermediate color in the heterozygote is simply that the pigment produced by the red allele (anthocyanin) is diluted in the heterozygote and therefore appears pink because of the white background of the flower petals.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.13"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_220" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-220" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4553" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_03_01.jpg" alt="Photo is of a snapdragon with a pink flower." width="400" height="533" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_03_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_03_01-225x300.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_03_01-65x87.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_08_03_01-350x466.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-220">Figure 8.13 These pink flowers of a heterozygote snapdragon result from incomplete dominance.

An example of codominance occurs in the ABO blood groups of humans. The A and B alleles are expressed in the form of A or B molecules present on the surface of red blood cells. Homozygotes (<em>I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>A</sup></em> and <em>I<sup>B</sup>I<sup>B</sup></em>) express either the A or the B phenotype, and heterozygotes (<em>I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup></em>) express both phenotypes equally. The <em>I<sup>A</sup>I<sup>B</sup></em> individual has blood type AB. In a self-cross between heterozygotes expressing a codominant trait, the three possible offspring genotypes are phenotypically distinct. However, the 1:2:1 genotypic ratio characteristic of a Mendelian monohybrid cross still applies (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.14" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.14">Figure 8.14</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.14"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_221" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-221" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4554" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_02.jpg" alt="A Punnett square showing both parents with AB blood types.

We now know that this is an oversimplification. Although individual humans (and all diploid organisms) <strong>can only have two alleles for a given gene, multiple alleles may exist at the population level</strong>, such that many combinations of two alleles are observed. Note that when many alleles exist for the same gene, the convention is to denote the most common phenotype or genotype in the natural population as the wild type (often abbreviated “+”). All other phenotypes or genotypes are considered variants (mutants) of this typical form, meaning they deviate from the wild type. The variant may be recessive or dominant to the wild-type allele.</p> <p id="fs-idm74837936">An example of multiple alleles is the ABO blood-type system in humans. In this case, there are three alleles circulating in the population. The <em>I<sup>A</sup></em> allele codes for A molecules on the red blood cells, the <em>I<sup>B</sup></em> allele codes for B molecules on the surface of red blood cells, and the <em>i</em> allele codes for no molecules on the red blood cells. In this case, the <em>I<sup>A</sup></em> and <em>I<sup>B</sup></em> alleles are codominant with each other and are both dominant over the <em>i</em> allele. Although there are three alleles present in a population, each individual only gets two of the alleles from their parents. This produces the genotypes and phenotypes shown in <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch08_03_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#fig-ch08_03_03">Figure 8.15</a>. Notice that instead of three genotypes, there are six different genotypes when there are three alleles. The number of possible phenotypes depends on the dominance relationships between the three alleles.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch08_03_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-222" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4555" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03.jpg" alt="A Punnett square showing the possible genotype and phenotypes of the ABO blood types in humans." width="400" height="296" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03-300x222.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03-65x48.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03-225x167.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_03-350x259.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-222">Figure 8.15 Inheritance of the ABO blood system in humans is shown.</div></div> </div> <h2>Multiple Alleles Confer Drug Resistance in the Malaria Parasite</h2> <p>Malaria is a parasitic disease in humans that is transmitted by infected female mosquitoes, including <em>Anopheles gambiae</em>, and is characterized by cyclic high fevers, chills, flu-like symptoms, and severe anemia. <em>Plasmodium falciparum </em>and <em>P. vivax </em>are the most common causative agents of malaria, and <em>P. falciparum </em>is the most deadly. When promptly and correctly treated, <em>P. falciparum</em> malaria has a mortality rate of 0.1 percent. However, in some parts of the world, the parasite has evolved resistance to commonly used malaria treatments, so the most effective malarial treatments can vary by geographic region.</p> <p id="fs-idp86937072">In Southeast Asia, Africa, and South America, <em>P. falciparum</em> has developed resistance to the anti-malarial drugs chloroquine, mefloquine, and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine. <em>P. falciparum</em>, which is haploid during the life stage in which it is infective to humans, has evolved multiple drug-resistant mutant alleles of the <em>dhps </em>gene. Varying degrees of sulfadoxine resistance are associated with each of these alleles. Being haploid, <em>P. falciparum </em>needs only one drug-resistant allele to express this trait.</p> <p id="fs-idp131372000">In Southeast Asia, different sulfadoxine-resistant alleles of the <em>dhps</em> gene are localized to different geographic regions. This is a common evolutionary phenomenon that comes about because drug-resistant mutants arise in a population and interbreed with other <em>P. falciparum </em>isolates in close proximity. Sulfadoxine-resistant parasites cause considerable human hardship in regions in which this drug is widely used as an over-the-counter malaria remedy. As is common with pathogens that multiply to large numbers within an infection cycle, <em>P. falciparum</em> evolves relatively rapidly (over a decade or so) in response to the selective pressure of commonly used anti-malarial drugs. For this reason, scientists must constantly work to develop new drugs or drug combinations to combat the worldwide malaria burden.<sup><a href="#footnote1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a></sup></p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm78704080"><h2>Sex-Linked Traits</h2> <p id="fs-idp152038032">In humans, as well as in many other animals and some plants, the sex of the individual is determined by sex chromosomes—one pair of non-homologous chromosomes. Until now, we have only considered inheritance patterns among <strong>non-sex chromosomes, or autosomes</strong>. In addition to 22 homologous pairs of autosomes, human females have a homologous pair of X chromosomes, whereas human <strong>males have an XY</strong> chromosome pair. Although the Y chromosome contains a small region of similarity to the X chromosome so that they can pair during meiosis, the Y chromosome is much shorter and contains fewer genes. When a gene being examined is present on the X, but not the Y, chromosome, it is X-linked.</p> <p id="fs-idp41386688">Eye color in <em>Drosophila</em>, the common fruit fly, was the first X-linked trait to be identified. Thomas Hunt Morgan mapped this trait to the X chromosome in 1910. Like humans, <em>Drosophila</em> males have an XY chromosome pair, and females are XX. In flies the wild-type eye color is red (X<em><sup>W</sup></em>) and is dominant to white eye color (X<em><sup>w</sup></em>) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch08_03_04" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#fig-ch08_03_04">Figure 8.16</a>). Because of the location of the eye-color gene, reciprocal crosses do not produce the same offspring ratios. Males are said to be <strong>hemizygous</strong>, in that they have only one allele for any X-linked characteristic. Hemizygosity makes descriptions of dominance and recessiveness irrelevant for XY males. <em>Drosophila</em> males lack the white gene on the Y chromosome; that is, their genotype can only be X<sup>W</sup>Y or X<em><sup>w</sup></em>Y. In contrast, females have two allele copies of this gene and can be X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>W</sup></em>, X<em><sup>W</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>, or X<em><sup>w</sup></em>X<em><sup>w</sup></em>.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch08_03_04"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_223" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-223" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4556" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04.jpg" alt="Photo shows two fruit flies, one with red eyes and one with white eyes." width="400" height="313" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04-300x234.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04-65x51.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04-225x176.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_04-350x273.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-223">Figure 8.16 In Drosophila, the gene for eye color is located on the X chromosome.

Now, consider a cross between a homozygous white-eyed female and a male with red eyes.

When a female parent is homozygous for a recessive X-linked trait, she will pass the trait on to 100 percent of her male offspring, because the males will receive the Y chromosome from the male parent. In humans, the alleles for certain conditions (some color-blindness, hemophilia, and muscular dystrophy) are X-linked. Females who are heterozygous for these diseases are said to be carriers and may not exhibit any phenotypic effects. These females will pass the disease to half of their sons and will pass carrier status to half of their daughters; therefore, X-linked traits appear more frequently in males than females.</p> <p id="fs-idm58295392">In some groups of organisms with sex chromosomes, the sex with the non-homologous sex chromosomes is the female rather than the male. This is the case for all birds. In this case, sex-linked traits will be more likely to appear in the female, in whom they are hemizygous.</p> <div id="fs-idm33069616" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <h2><span id="fs-idm2899216"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/sex-linkd_trts2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></h2> <p id="fs-idp171029328">Watch <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sex-linked_trts" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/sex-linked_trts">this video</a> to learn more about sex-linked traits.</p> <h2>Linked Genes Violate the Law of Independent Assortment</h2> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm66440368"><p id="fs-idm29670176">Although all of Mendel’s pea plant characteristics behaved according to the law of independent assortment, we now know that some allele combinations are not inherited independently of each other. Genes that are located on separate, non-homologous chromosomes will always sort independently. However, each chromosome contains hundreds or thousands of genes, organized linearly on chromosomes like beads on a string. The segregation of alleles into gametes can be influenced by linkage, in which genes that are located physically close to each other on the same chromosome are more likely to be inherited as a pair. However, because of the process of recombination, or “crossover,” it is possible for two genes on the same chromosome to behave independently, or as if they are not linked. To understand this, let us consider the biological basis of gene linkage and recombination.</p> <p id="fs-idp101831744">Homologous chromosomes possess the same genes in the same order, though the specific alleles of the gene can be different on each of the two chromosomes. Recall that during interphase and prophase I of meiosis, homologous chromosomes first replicate and then synapse, with like genes on the homologs aligning with each other. At this stage, segments of homologous chromosomes exchange linear segments of genetic material (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.18" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.18">Figure 8.18</a>). This process is called recombination, or crossover, and it is a common genetic process. Because the genes are aligned during recombination, the gene order is not altered. Instead, the result of recombination is that maternal and paternal alleles are combined onto the same chromosome. Across a given chromosome, several recombination events may occur, causing extensive shuffling of alleles.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure8.18"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-226" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_08_03_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4559" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_08_03_06.jpg" alt="This illustration shows a pair of homologous chromosomes.

To exemplify this, imagine a dihybrid cross involving flower color and plant height in which the genes are next to each other on the chromosome. If one homologous chromosome has alleles for tall plants and red flowers, and the other chromosome has genes for short plants and yellow flowers, then when the gametes are formed, the tall and red alleles will tend to go together into a gamete and the short and yellow alleles will go into other gametes. These are called the parental genotypes because they have been inherited intact from the parents of the individual producing gametes. But unlike if the genes were on different chromosomes, there will be no gametes with tall and yellow alleles and no gametes with short and red alleles. If you create a Punnett square with these gametes, you will see that the classical Mendelian prediction of a 9:3:3:1 outcome of a dihybrid cross would not apply. As the distance between two genes increases, the probability of one or more crossovers between them increases and the genes behave more like they are on separate chromosomes. Geneticists have used the proportion of recombinant gametes (the ones not like the parents) as a measure of how far apart genes are on a chromosome. Using this information, they have constructed linkage maps of genes on chromosomes for well-studied organisms, including humans.</p> <p id="fs-idm72248416">Mendel’s seminal publication makes no mention of linkage, and many researchers have questioned whether he encountered linkage but chose not to publish those crosses out of concern that they would invalidate his independent assortment postulate. The garden pea has seven chromosomes, and some have suggested that his choice of seven characteristics was not a coincidence. However, even if the genes he examined were not located on separate chromosomes, it is possible that he simply did not observe linkage because of the extensive shuffling effects of recombination.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm50010816"><h1>Epistasis</h1> <p id="fs-idp62869680">Mendel’s studies in pea plants implied that the sum of an individual’s phenotype was controlled by genes (or as he called them, unit factors), such that every characteristic was distinctly and completely controlled by a single gene. In fact, single observable characteristics are almost always under the influence of multiple genes (each with two or more alleles) acting in unison. For example, at least eight genes contribute to eye color in humans.</p> <div id="fs-idp3048560" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idm22011648"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/eye_color_calc.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp10702000">Eye color in humans is determined by multiple alleles.

In the case of organ development, for instance, genes may be expressed sequentially, with each gene adding to the complexity and specificity of the organ. Genes may function in complementary or synergistic fashions, such that two or more genes expressed simultaneously affect a phenotype. An apparent example of this occurs with human skin color, which appears to involve the action of at least three (and probably more) genes. Cases in which inheritance for a characteristic like skin color or human height depend on the combined effects of numerous genes are called polygenic inheritance.</p> <p id="fs-idm51847376">Genes may also oppose each other, with one gene suppressing the expression of another. In epistasis, the interaction between genes is antagonistic, such that one gene masks or interferes with the expression of another. “Epistasis” is a word composed of Greek roots meaning <strong>“standing upon.”</strong> The alleles that are being <strong>masked or silenced</strong> are said to be hypostatic to the epistatic alleles that are doing the masking. Often the biochemical basis of epistasis is a gene pathway in which expression of one gene is dependent on the function of a gene that precedes or follows it in the pathway.</p> <p id="fs-idp86102160">An example of epistasis is pigmentation in mice. The wild-type coat color, agouti (AA) is dominant to solid-colored fur (aa). However, a separate gene C, when present as the recessive homozygote (cc), negates any expression of pigment from the A gene and results in an albino mouse (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.19" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.19">Figure 8.19</a>). Therefore, the genotypes <em>AAcc</em>, <em>Aacc</em>, and <em>aacc</em> all produce the same albino phenotype. A cross between heterozygotes for both genes (<em>AaCc</em> x <em>AaCc</em>) would generate offspring with a phenotypic ratio of 9 agouti:3 black:4 albino (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure8.19" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/8-3-extensions-of-the-laws-of-inheritance/#figure8.19">Figure 8.19</a>).

Incomplete dominance describes situations in which the heterozygote exhibits a phenotype that is intermediate between the homozygous phenotypes. Codominance describes the simultaneous expression of both of the alleles in the heterozygote. Although diploid organisms can only have two alleles for any given gene, it is common for more than two alleles for a gene to exist in a population. In humans, as in many animals and some plants, females have two X chromosomes and males have one X and one Y chromosome. Genes that are present on the X but not the Y chromosome are said to be X-linked, such that males only inherit one allele for the gene, and females inherit two.</p> <p id="fs-idp5954128">According to Mendel’s law of independent assortment, genes sort independently of each other into gametes during meiosis. This occurs because chromosomes, on which the genes reside, assort independently during meiosis and crossovers cause most genes on the same chromosomes to also behave independently. When genes are located in close proximity on the same chromosome, their alleles tend to be inherited together. This results in offspring ratios that violate Mendel’s law of independent assortment. However, recombination serves to exchange genetic material on homologous chromosomes such that maternal and paternal alleles may be recombined on the same chromosome. This is why alleles on a given chromosome are not always inherited together. Recombination is a random event occurring anywhere on a chromosome. Therefore, genes that are far apart on the same chromosome are likely to still assort independently because of recombination events that occurred in the intervening chromosomal space.</p> <p id="fs-idm17357120">Whether or not they are sorting independently, genes may interact at the level of gene products, such that the expression of an allele for one gene masks or modifies the expression of an allele for a different gene.

It also allows us to understand the workings of evolution in populations of organisms. Over a thousand species have had their entire genome sequenced, and there have been thousands of individual human genome sequences completed. These sequences will allow us to understand human disease and the relationship of humans to the rest of the tree of life. Finally, molecular genetics techniques have revolutionized plant and animal breeding for human agricultural needs. All of these advances in biotechnology depended on basic research leading to the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and the research since then that has uncovered the details of DNA replication and the complex process leading to the expression of DNA in the form of proteins in the cell.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Search for Key Points in Chapter 9</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Other scientists, such as Linus Pauling and Maurice Wilkins, were also actively exploring this field. Pauling had discovered the secondary structure of proteins using X-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography is a method for investigating molecular structure by observing the patterns formed by X-rays shot through a crystal of the substance. The patterns give important information about the structure of the molecule of interest. In Wilkins’ lab, researcher Rosalind Franklin was using X-ray crystallography to understand the structure of DNA. Watson and Crick were able to piece together the puzzle of the DNA molecule using Franklin’s data (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.2" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-1-the-structure-of-dna/#figure9.2">Figure 9.2</a>). Watson and Crick also had key pieces of information available from other researchers such as Chargaff’s rules. Chargaff had shown that of the four kinds of monomers (nucleotides) present in a DNA molecule, two types were always present in equal amounts and the remaining two types were also always present in equal amounts.

The sugar–phosphate groups line up in a “backbone” for each single strand of DNA, and the nucleotide bases stick out from this backbone. The carbon atoms of the five-carbon sugar are numbered clockwise from the oxygen as 1′, 2′, 3′, 4′, and 5′ (1′ is read as “one prime”). The phosphate group is attached to the 5′ carbon of one nucleotide and the 3′ carbon of the next nucleotide. In its natural state, each DNA molecule is actually composed of two single strands held together along their length with hydrogen bonds between the bases.</p> <p id="fs-idm91927088">Watson and Crick proposed that the DNA is made up of two strands that are twisted around each other to form a right-handed helix, called a double helix. Base-pairing takes place between a purine and pyrimidine: namely, <strong>A pairs with T, and G pairs with C</strong>. In other words, adenine and thymine are complementary base pairs, and cytosine and guanine are also complementary base pairs. This is the basis for Chargaff’s rule; because of their complementarity, there is as much adenine as thymine in a DNA molecule and as much guanine as cytosine. Adenine and thymine are connected by two hydrogen bonds, and cytosine and guanine are connected by three hydrogen bonds. The two strands are anti-parallel in nature; that is, one strand will have the 3′ carbon of the sugar in the “upward” position, whereas the other strand will have the 5′ carbon in the upward position. The diameter of the DNA double helix is uniform throughout because a purine (two rings) always pairs with a pyrimidine (one ring) and their combined lengths are always equal.

Stretched end-to-end, the DNA molecules in a single human cell would come to a <strong>length of about 2 meters</strong>. Thus, the DNA for a cell must be packaged in a very ordered way to fit and function within a structure (the cell) that is not visible to the naked eye.

So how does this fit inside a small bacterial cell? The DNA is twisted beyond the double helix in what is known as supercoiling. Some proteins are known to be involved in the supercoiling; other proteins and enzymes help in maintaining the supercoiled structure.</p> <p id="fs-idm76642592">Eukaryotes, whose chromosomes each consist of a linear DNA molecule, employ a different type of packing strategy to fit their DNA inside the nucleus. At the most basic level, DNA is wrapped around proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. The DNA is wrapped tightly around the histone core. This nucleosome is linked to the next one by a short strand of DNA that is free of histones. This is also known as the “beads on a string” structure; the nucleosomes are the “beads” and the short lengths of DNA between them are the “string.” The nucleosomes, with their DNA coiled around them, stack compactly onto each other to form a 30-nm–wide fiber. This fiber is further coiled into a thicker and more compact structure. At the metaphase stage of mitosis, when the chromosomes are lined up in the center of the cell, the chromosomes are at their most compacted. They are approximately 700 nm in width, and are found in association with scaffold proteins.</p> <p id="fs-idp3513200">In interphase, the phase of the cell cycle between mitoses at which the chromosomes are decondensed, eukaryotic chromosomes have two distinct regions that can be distinguished by staining. There is a tightly packaged region that stains darkly, and a less dense region. The darkly staining regions usually contain genes that are not active, and are found in the regions of the centromere and telomeres. The lightly staining regions usually contain genes that are active, with DNA packaged around nucleosomes but not further compacted.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure9.7"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_238" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-238" style="width: 373px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_01_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_01_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4575" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_09_01_06.jpg" alt="Illustration shows levels of organization of eukaryotic chromosomes, starting with the DNA double helix, which wraps around histone proteins.

The DNA molecule is a polymer of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed of a nitrogenous base, a five-carbon sugar (deoxyribose), and a phosphate group. There are four nitrogenous bases in DNA, two purines (adenine and guanine) and two pyrimidines (cytosine and thymine). A DNA molecule is composed of two strands. Each strand is composed of nucleotides bonded together covalently between the phosphate group of one and the deoxyribose sugar of the next. From this backbone extend the bases. The bases of one strand bond to the bases of the second strand with hydrogen bonds. Adenine always bonds with thymine, and cytosine always bonds with guanine. The bonding causes the two strands to spiral around each other in a shape called a double helix. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) is a second nucleic acid found in cells. RNA is a single-stranded polymer of nucleotides. It also differs from DNA in that it contains the sugar ribose, rather than deoxyribose, and the nucleotide uracil rather than thymine. Various RNA molecules function in the process of forming proteins from the genetic code in DNA.</p> <p id="fs-idm101262432">Prokaryotes contain a single, double-stranded circular chromosome. Eukaryotes contain double-stranded linear DNA molecules packaged into chromosomes. The DNA helix is wrapped around proteins to form nucleosomes. The protein coils are further coiled, and during mitosis and meiosis, the chromosomes become even more greatly coiled to facilitate their movement. Chromosomes have two distinct regions which can be distinguished by staining, reflecting different degrees of packaging and determined by whether the DNA in a region is being expressed (euchromatin) or not (heterochromatin).</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The new strand will be complementary to the parental or “old” strand. Each new double strand consists of one parental strand and one new daughter strand. This is known as semiconservative replication. When two DNA copies are formed, they have an identical sequence of nucleotide bases and are divided equally into two daughter cells.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm136789792"><h1>DNA Replication in Eukaryotes</h1> <p id="fs-idm84511984">Because eukaryotic genomes are very complex, DNA replication is a <strong>very complicated process</strong> that involves several enzymes and other proteins. It occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.</p> <p id="fs-idm148333296">Recall that eukaryotic DNA is bound to proteins known as histones to form structures called nucleosomes. During initiation, the DNA is made accessible to the proteins and enzymes involved in the replication process. How does the replication machinery know where on the DNA double helix to begin? It turns out that there are specific nucleotide sequences called origins of replication at which replication begins. Certain proteins bind to the origin of replication while an enzyme called helicase unwinds and opens up the DNA helix. As the DNA opens up, Y-shaped structures called replication forks are formed (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.10" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/#figure9.10">Figure 9.10</a>). Two replication forks are formed at the origin of replication, and these get extended in both directions as replication proceeds. There are multiple origins of replication on the eukaryotic chromosome, such that replication can occur simultaneously from several places in the genome.</p> <p id="fs-idm98257952">During elongation, an enzyme called <strong>DNA polymerase</strong> adds DNA nucleotides to the 3′ end of the template. Because DNA polymerase can only add new nucleotides at the end of a backbone, a primer sequence, which provides this starting point, is added with complementary RNA nucleotides. This primer is removed later, and the nucleotides are replaced with DNA nucleotides. One strand, which is complementary to the parental DNA strand, is synthesized continuously toward the replication fork so the polymerase can add nucleotides in this direction. This continuously synthesized strand is known as the leading strand. Because DNA polymerase can only synthesize DNA in a 5′ to 3′ direction, the other new strand is put together in short pieces called Okazaki fragments. The Okazaki fragments each require a primer made of RNA to start the synthesis. The strand with the Okazaki fragments is known as the lagging strand. As synthesis proceeds, an enzyme removes the RNA primer, which is then replaced with DNA nucleotides, and the gaps between fragments are sealed by an enzyme called DNA ligase.</p> <p id="fs-idm152388640">The process of DNA replication can be summarized as follows:</p> <ol id="eip-983"><li>DNA unwinds at the origin of replication.</li> <li>New bases are added to the complementary parental strands.

As you have learned, the DNA polymerase enzyme can add nucleotides in only one direction. In the leading strand, synthesis continues until the end of the chromosome is reached; however, on the lagging strand there is no place for a primer to be made for the DNA fragment to be copied at the end of the chromosome. This presents a problem for the cell because the ends remain unpaired, and over time these ends get progressively shorter as cells continue to divide. The ends of the linear chromosomes are known as telomeres, which have repetitive sequences that do not code for a particular gene. As a consequence, it is telomeres that are shortened with each round of DNA replication instead of genes. For example, in humans, a six base-pair sequence, TTAGGG, is repeated 100 to 1000 times. The discovery of the enzyme telomerase (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch09_02_04" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/#fig-ch09_02_04">Figure 9.11</a>) helped in the understanding of how chromosome ends are maintained. The telomerase attaches to the end of the chromosome, and complementary bases to the RNA template are added on the end of the DNA strand. Once the lagging strand template is sufficiently elongated, DNA polymerase can now add nucleotides that are complementary to the ends of the chromosomes. Thus, the ends of the chromosomes are replicated.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch09_02_04"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_244" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-244" style="width: 392px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_02_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_02_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4582" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_09_02_04.jpg" alt="Telomerase has an associated RNA that complements the 5' overhang at the end of the chromosome.

Most mistakes are corrected during replication, although when this does not happen, the mismatch repair mechanism is employed. Mismatch repair enzymes recognize the wrongly incorporated base and excise it from the DNA, replacing it with the correct base (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.13" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/#figure9.13">Figure 9.13 </a><strong>b</strong>). In yet another type of repair, nucleotide excision repair, the DNA double strand is unwound and separated, the incorrect bases are removed along with a few bases on the 5′ and 3′ end, and these are replaced by copying the template with the help of DNA polymerase (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.13" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-2-dna-replication/#figure9.13">Figure 9.13 </a><strong>c</strong>). Nucleotide excision repair is particularly important in correcting thymine dimers, which are primarily caused by ultraviolet light. In a thymine dimer, two thymine nucleotides adjacent to each other on one strand are covalently bonded to each other rather than their complementary bases. If the dimer is not removed and repaired it will lead to a mutation.

The DNA is opened with enzymes, resulting in the formation of the replication fork. Primase synthesizes an RNA primer to initiate synthesis by DNA polymerase, which can add nucleotides in only one direction. One strand is synthesized continuously in the direction of the replication fork; this is called the leading strand. The other strand is synthesized in a direction away from the replication fork, in short stretches of DNA known as Okazaki fragments. This strand is known as the lagging strand. Once replication is completed, the RNA primers are replaced by DNA nucleotides and the DNA is sealed with DNA ligase.</p> <p id="fs-idm127048080">The ends of eukaryotic chromosomes pose a problem, as polymerase is unable to extend them without a primer. Telomerase, an enzyme with an inbuilt RNA template, extends the ends by copying the RNA template and extending one end of the chromosome. DNA polymerase can then extend the DNA using the primer. In this way, the ends of the chromosomes are protected. Cells have mechanisms for repairing DNA when it becomes damaged or errors are made in replication. These mechanisms include mismatch repair to replace nucleotides that are paired with a non-complementary base and nucleotide excision repair, which removes bases that are damaged such as thymine dimers.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

With the genes bound in the nucleus, transcription occurs in the nucleus of the cell and the mRNA transcript must be transported to the cytoplasm. The prokaryotes, which include bacteria and archaea, lack membrane-bound nuclei and other organelles, and transcription occurs in the cytoplasm of the cell. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, transcription occurs in three main stages: initiation, elongation, and termination.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm261773808"><h2>Initiation</h2> <p id="fs-idm163336272">Transcription requires the DNA double helix to partially unwind in the region of mRNA synthesis. The region of unwinding is called a transcription bubble. The DNA sequence onto which the proteins and enzymes involved in transcription bind to initiate the process is called a promoter. In most cases, promoters exist upstream of the genes they regulate. The specific sequence of a promoter is very important because it determines whether the corresponding gene is transcribed all of the time, some of the time, or hardly at all (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.15" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-3-transcription/#figure9.15">Figure 9.15</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure9.15"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_250" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-250" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_03_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_03_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4589" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_09_03_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a template strand and nontemplate strand of DNA, with a promoter section in red on the template strand.

In a prokaryotic cell, by the time termination occurs, the transcript would already have been used to partially synthesize numerous copies of the encoded protein because these processes can occur concurrently using multiple ribosomes (polyribosomes) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.17" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-3-transcription/#figure9.17">Figure 9.17</a>).

The additional steps involved in eukaryotic mRNA maturation create a molecule that is much more stable than a prokaryotic mRNA. For example, eukaryotic mRNAs last for several hours, whereas the typical prokaryotic mRNA lasts no more than five seconds.</p> <p id="fs-idm105982144">The mRNA transcript is first coated in RNA-stabilizing proteins to prevent it from degrading while it is processed and exported out of the nucleus. This occurs while the pre-mRNA still is being synthesized by adding a special nucleotide “cap” to the 5′ end of the growing transcript. In addition to preventing degradation, factors involved in protein synthesis recognize the cap to help initiate translation by ribosomes.</p> <p id="fs-idm202965792">Once elongation is complete, an enzyme then adds a string of approximately 200 adenine residues to the 3′ end, called the poly-A tail. This modification further protects the pre-mRNA from degradation and signals to cellular factors that the transcript needs to be exported to the cytoplasm.</p> <p id="fs-idm218084608">Eukaryotic genes are composed of protein-coding sequences called exons (<em>ex-</em>on signifies that they are <em>ex</em>pressed) and <em>int</em>ervening sequences called introns (<em>int-</em>ron denotes their <em>int</em>ervening role). Introns are removed from the pre-mRNA during processing. Intron sequences in mRNA do not encode functional proteins. It is essential that all of a pre-mRNA’s introns be completely and precisely removed before protein synthesis so that the exons join together to code for the correct amino acids. If the process errs by even a single nucleotide, the sequence of the rejoined exons would be shifted, and the resulting protein would be nonfunctional. The process of removing introns and reconnecting exons is called splicing (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.18" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-3-transcription/#figure9.18">Figure 9.18</a>).

A ribosome is a complex macromolecule composed of structural and catalytic rRNAs, and many distinct polypeptides. In eukaryotes, the nucleolus is completely specialized for the synthesis and assembly of rRNAs.</p> <p id="fs-idp40004288">Ribosomes are located in the cytoplasm in prokaryotes and in the cytoplasm and endoplasmic reticulum of eukaryotes. Ribosomes are made up of a large and a small subunit that come together for translation. The small subunit is responsible for binding the mRNA template, whereas the large subunit sequentially binds tRNAs, a type of RNA molecule that brings amino acids to the growing chain of the polypeptide. Each mRNA molecule is simultaneously translated by many ribosomes, all synthesizing protein in the same direction.</p> <p id="fs-idp86500640">Depending on the species, 40 to 60 types of tRNA exist in the cytoplasm. Serving as adaptors, specific tRNAs bind to sequences on the mRNA template and add the corresponding amino acid to the polypeptide chain. Therefore, tRNAs are the molecules that actually “translate” the language of RNA into the language of proteins. For each tRNA to function, it must have its specific amino acid bonded to it. In the process of tRNA “charging,” each tRNA molecule is bonded to its correct amino acid.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp165032192"><h1>The Genetic Code</h1> <p>Universality of the Genetic Code</p> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Translation of the mRNA template converts nucleotide-based genetic information into a protein product. Protein sequences consist of <strong>20 commonly occurring amino acids</strong>; therefore, it can be said that the <strong>protein alphabet consists of 20 letters</strong>. Each amino acid is defined by a three-nucleotide sequence called the <strong>triplet codon</strong>. The relationship between a nucleotide codon and its corresponding amino acid is called the genetic code.</p> <p id="fs-idm42787104">Given the different numbers of “letters” in the mRNA and protein “alphabets,” combinations of nucleotides corresponded to single amino acids.

These triplets are called stop codons. Another codon, AUG, also has a special function. In addition to specifying the amino acid methionine, it also serves as the start codon to initiate translation. The reading frame for translation is set by the AUG start codon near the 5′ end of the mRNA. <strong>The genetic code is universal</strong>. With a few exceptions, virtually all species use the same genetic code for protein synthesis, which is powerful evidence that all life on Earth shares a common origin.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp89090192"><h1>The Mechanism of Protein Synthesis</h1> <p id="fs-idp91206144">Just as with mRNA synthesis, protein synthesis can be divided into three phases: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process of translation is similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Here we will explore how translation occurs in <em>E. coli</em>, a representative prokaryote, and specify any differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic translation.</p> <p id="fs-idp5517792">Protein synthesis begins with the formation of an initiation complex. In <em>E. coli</em>, this complex involves the small ribosome subunit, the mRNA template, three initiation factors, and a special initiator tRNA. The initiator tRNA interacts with the AUG start codon, and links to a special form of the amino acid methionine that is typically removed from the polypeptide after translation is complete.</p> <p id="fs-idp83193104">In prokaryotes and eukaryotes, the basics of polypeptide elongation are the same, so we will review elongation from the perspective of <em>E. coli</em>. The large ribosomal subunit of <em>E. coli </em>consists of three compartments: the A site binds incoming charged tRNAs (tRNAs with their attached specific amino acids). The P site binds charged tRNAs carrying amino acids that have formed bonds with the growing polypeptide chain but have not yet dissociated from their corresponding tRNA. The E site releases dissociated tRNAs so they can be recharged with free amino acids. The ribosome shifts one codon at a time, catalyzing each process that occurs in the three sites. With each step, a charged tRNA enters the complex, the polypeptide becomes one amino acid longer, and an uncharged tRNA departs. The energy for each bond between amino acids is derived from GTP, a molecule similar to ATP (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.21" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-4-translation/#figure9.21">Figure 9.21</a>). Amazingly, the <em>E. coli </em>translation apparatus takes only 0.05 seconds to add each amino acid, meaning that a 200-amino acid polypeptide could be translated in just 10 seconds.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure9.21"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_257" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-257" style="width: 348px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_04_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_04_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4597" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_09_04_03.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the steps of protein synthesis.

Genes are used to make mRNA by the process of transcription; mRNA is used to synthesize proteins by the process of translation. The genetic code is the correspondence between the three-nucleotide mRNA codon and an amino acid. The genetic code is “translated” by the tRNA molecules, which associate a specific codon with a specific amino acid. The genetic code is degenerate because 64 triplet codons in mRNA specify only 20 amino acids and three stop codons. This means that more than one codon corresponds to an amino acid. Almost every species on the planet uses the same genetic code.</p> <p id="fs-idp69417712">The players in translation include the mRNA template, ribosomes, tRNAs, and various enzymatic factors. The small ribosomal subunit binds to the mRNA template. Translation begins at the initiating AUG on the mRNA. The formation of bonds occurs between sequential amino acids specified by the mRNA template according to the genetic code. The ribosome accepts charged tRNAs, and as it steps along the mRNA, it catalyzes bonding between the new amino acid and the end of the growing polypeptide. The entire mRNA is translated in three-nucleotide “steps” of the ribosome. When a stop codon is encountered, a release factor binds and dissociates the components and frees the new protein.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

All organisms and cells control or regulate the transcription and translation of their DNA into protein. The process of turning on a gene to produce RNA and protein is called gene expression. Whether in a simple unicellular organism or in a complex multicellular organism, each cell controls when and how its genes are expressed. For this to occur, there must be a mechanism to control when a gene is expressed to make RNA and protein, how much of the protein is made, and when it is time to stop making that protein because it is no longer needed.</p> <p id="fs-idp30260000">Cells in multicellular organisms are specialized; cells in different tissues look very different and perform different functions. For example, a muscle cell is very different from a liver cell, which is very different from a skin cell. These differences are a consequence of the expression of different sets of genes in each of these cells. All cells have certain basic functions they must perform for themselves, such as converting the energy in sugar molecules into energy in ATP. Each cell also has many genes that are not expressed, and expresses many that are not expressed by other cells, such that it can carry out its specialized functions. In addition, cells will turn on or off certain genes at different times in response to changes in the environment or at different times during the development of the organism. Unicellular organisms, both eukaryotic and prokaryotic, also turn on and off genes in response to the demands of their environment so that they can respond to special conditions.</p> <p id="fs-idp100648688">The control of gene expression is extremely complex. Malfunctions in this process are detrimental to the cell and can lead to the development of many diseases, including cancer.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm10196880"><h1>Prokaryotic versus Eukaryotic Gene Expression</h1> <p id="fs-idp25037824">To understand how gene expression is regulated, we must first understand how a gene becomes a functional protein in a cell. The process occurs in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, just in slightly different fashions.</p> <p id="fs-idp73880288">Because prokaryotic organisms lack a cell nucleus, the processes of transcription and translation occur almost simultaneously. When the protein is no longer needed, transcription stops. As a result, the primary method to control what type and how much protein is expressed in a prokaryotic cell is through the regulation of DNA transcription into RNA. All the subsequent steps happen automatically. When more protein is required, more transcription occurs. Therefore, in prokaryotic cells, the control of gene expression is almost entirely at the transcriptional level.</p> <p id="fs-idp62326576">The first example of such control was discovered using <em>E</em>. <em>coli</em> in the 1950s and 1960s by French researchers and is called the <em>lac</em> operon. The <em>lac</em> operon is a stretch of DNA with three adjacent genes that code for proteins that participate in the absorption and metabolism of lactose, a food source for <em>E</em>. <em>coli</em>. When lactose is not present in the bacterium’s environment, the <em>lac</em> genes are transcribed in small amounts. When lactose is present, the genes are transcribed and the bacterium is able to use the lactose as a food source. The operon also contains a promoter sequence to which the RNA polymerase binds to begin transcription; between the promoter and the three genes is a region called the operator. When there is no lactose present, a protein known as a repressor binds to the operator and prevents RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter, except in rare cases. Thus very little of the protein products of the three genes is made. When lactose is present, an end product of lactose metabolism binds to the repressor protein and prevents it from binding to the operator. This allows RNA polymerase to bind to the promoter and freely transcribe the three genes, allowing the organism to metabolize the lactose.</p> <p id="fs-idp103450048">Eukaryotic cells, in contrast, have intracellular organelles and are much more complex. Recall that in eukaryotic cells, the DNA is contained inside the cell’s nucleus and it is transcribed into mRNA there. The newly synthesized mRNA is then transported out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm, where ribosomes translate the mRNA into protein. The processes of transcription and translation are physically separated by the nuclear membrane; transcription occurs only within the nucleus, and translation only occurs outside the nucleus in the cytoplasm. The regulation of gene expression can occur at all stages of the process (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure9.22" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/9-5-how-genes-are-regulated/#figure9.22">Figure 9.22</a>). Regulation may occur when the DNA is uncoiled and loosened from nucleosomes to bind transcription factors (epigenetic level), when the RNA is transcribed (transcriptional level), when RNA is processed and exported to the cytoplasm after it is transcribed (post-transcriptional level), when the RNA is translated into protein (translational level), or after the protein has been made (post-translational level).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure9.22"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-260" style="width: 333px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_05_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_09_05_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4601" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_09_05_01.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the steps of protein synthesis in three steps: transcription, RNA processing, and translation.

In the case of an alternative donor site, an alternative 5' splice junction (donor site) is used, changing the 3' boundary of the upstream exon. In the case of an alternative acceptor site, an alternative 3' splice junction (acceptor site) is used, changing the 5' boundary of the downstream exon. In the case of intron retention, a sequence may be spliced out as an intron or simply retained. This is distinguished from exon skipping because the retained sequence is not flanked by introns.

Introns have a beginning and ending recognition sequence, and it is easy to imagine the failure of the splicing mechanism to identify the end of an intron and find the end of the next intron, thus removing two introns and the intervening exon. In fact, there are mechanisms in place to prevent such exon skipping, but mutations are likely to lead to their failure. Such “mistakes” would more than likely produce a nonfunctional protein. Indeed, the cause of many genetic diseases is alternative splicing rather than mutations in a sequence. However, alternative splicing would create a protein variant without the loss of the original protein, opening up possibilities for adaptation of the new variant to new functions. Gene duplication has played an important role in the evolution of new functions in a similar way—by providing genes that may evolve without eliminating the original functional protein.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm23447328"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm108488528">While all somatic cells within an organism contain the same DNA, not all cells within that organism express the same proteins.

Biotechnology has been used for improving livestock and crops since the beginning of agriculture through selective breeding. Since the discovery of the structure of DNA in 1953, and particularly since the development of tools and methods to manipulate DNA in the 1970s, biotechnology has become synonymous with the manipulation of organisms’ DNA at the molecular level. The primary applications of this technology are in medicine (for the production of vaccines and antibiotics) and in agriculture (for the genetic modification of crops). Biotechnology also has many industrial applications, such as fermentation, the treatment of oil spills, and the production of biofuels, as well as many household applications such as the use of enzymes in laundry detergent.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp100069728"><h1>Manipulating Genetic Material</h1> <p id="fs-idp244015904">To accomplish the applications described above, biotechnologists must be able to extract, manipulate, and analyze nucleic acids.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm4017584"><h2>Review of Nucleic Acid Structure</h2> <p id="fs-idp58546624">To understand the basic techniques used to work with nucleic acids, remember that nucleic acids are macromolecules made of nucleotides (a sugar, a phosphate, and a nitrogenous base). The phosphate groups on these molecules each have a net negative charge. An entire set of DNA molecules in the nucleus of eukaryotic organisms is called the genome. DNA has two complementary strands linked by hydrogen bonds between the paired bases.</p> <p id="fs-idp150898864">Unlike DNA in eukaryotic cells, RNA molecules leave the nucleus.

Most nucleic acid extraction techniques involve steps to break open the cell, and then the use of enzymatic reactions to destroy all undesired macromolecules. Cells are broken open using a detergent solution containing buffering compounds. To prevent degradation and contamination, macromolecules such as proteins and RNA are inactivated using enzymes. The DNA is then brought out of solution using alcohol. The resulting DNA, because it is made up of long polymers, forms a gelatinous mass.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.2"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-265" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4608" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_10_01_01.jpg" alt="Four test tubes are illustrated, showing four steps in extracting DNA.

Gel electrophoresis is a technique used to separate charged molecules on the basis of size and charge. The nucleic acids can be separated as whole chromosomes or as fragments. The nucleic acids are loaded into a slot at one end of a gel matrix, an electric current is applied, and negatively charged molecules are pulled toward the opposite end of the gel (the end with the positive electrode). Smaller molecules move through the pores in the gel faster than larger molecules; this difference in the rate of migration separates the fragments on the basis of size. The nucleic acids in a gel matrix are invisible until they are stained with a compound that allows them to be seen, such as a dye. Distinct fragments of nucleic acids appear as bands at specific distances from the top of the gel (the negative electrode end) that are based on their size (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.3" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-1-cloning-and-genetic-engineering/#figure10.3">Figure 10.3</a>). A mixture of many fragments of varying sizes appear as a long smear, whereas uncut genomic DNA is usually too large to run through the gel and forms a single large band at the top of the gel.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.3"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-266" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4609" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_02.jpg" alt="Photo shows a black background with 9 faint gray vertical bands (lanes).

It also frequently involves situations in which only one or a few copies of a DNA molecule are available for further analysis. These amounts are insufficient for most procedures, such as gel electrophoresis. <strong>Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)</strong> is a technique used to <strong>rapidly increase the number of copies</strong> of specific regions of DNA for further analyses (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.4" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-1-cloning-and-genetic-engineering/#figure10.4">Figure 10.4</a>). PCR uses a special form of DNA polymerase, the enzyme that replicates DNA, and other short nucleotide sequences called primers that base pair to a specific portion of the DNA being replicated. PCR is used for many purposes in laboratories. These include: 1) the identification of the owner of a DNA sample left at a crime scene; 2) paternity analysis; 3) the comparison of small amounts of ancient DNA with modern organisms; and 4) determining the sequence of nucleotides in a specific region.</p> <div id="figure10.4"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-267" style="width: 342px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4610" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure showing PCR in 4 steps.

Typically, the word is used to describe the creation of a genetically identical copy. In biology, the re-creation of a whole organism is referred to as “reproductive cloning.” Long before attempts were made to clone an entire organism, researchers learned how to copy short stretches of DNA—a process that is referred to as molecular cloning.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm31276864"><h2>Molecular Cloning</h2> <p id="fs-idm33113680">Cloning allows for the creation of <strong>multiple copies of genes, expression of genes, and study of specific genes</strong>. To get the DNA fragment into a bacterial cell in a form that will be copied or expressed, the fragment is first inserted into a plasmid. A <strong>plasmid </strong>(also called a vector in this context) is a small circular DNA molecule that replicates independently of the chromosomal DNA in bacteria. In cloning, the plasmid molecules can be used to provide a “vehicle” in which to insert a desired DNA fragment. Modified plasmids are usually reintroduced into a bacterial host for replication. As the bacteria divide, they copy their own DNA (including the plasmids). The inserted DNA fragment is copied along with the rest of the bacterial DNA. In a bacterial cell, the fragment of DNA from the human genome (or another organism that is being studied) is referred to as foreign DNA to differentiate it from the DNA of the bacterium (the host DNA).</p> <p id="fs-idm33726112">Plasmids occur naturally in bacterial populations (such as <em>Escherichia coli</em>) and have genes that can contribute favorable traits to the organism, such as antibiotic resistance (the ability to be unaffected by antibiotics). Plasmids have been highly engineered as vectors for molecular cloning and for the subsequent large-scale production of important molecules, such as insulin. A valuable characteristic of plasmid vectors is the ease with which a foreign DNA fragment can be introduced. These plasmid vectors contain many short DNA sequences that can be cut with different commonly available restriction enzymes. <strong>Restriction enzymes</strong> (also called restriction endonucleases) recognize specific DNA sequences and cut them in a predictable manner; they are naturally produced by bacteria as a defense mechanism against foreign DNA. Many restriction enzymes make <strong>staggered cuts</strong> in the two strands of DNA, such that the cut ends have a 2- to 4-nucleotide single-stranded overhang. The sequence that is recognized by the restriction enzyme is a four- to eight-nucleotide sequence that is a <strong>palindrome</strong>. Like with a word palindrome, this means the sequence reads the same forward and backward. In most cases, the sequence reads the same forward on one strand and backward on the complementary strand. When a staggered cut is made in a sequence like this, the overhangs are complementary (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-1-cloning-and-genetic-engineering/#figure10.5">Figure 10.5</a>).</p> <div class="" id="figure10.5"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_268" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-268" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4611" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_04-1024x453-1.jpg" alt="In part A, the figure shows a strand of ladder-like DNA.

Addition of an enzyme called DNA ligase, which takes part in DNA replication in cells, permanently joins the DNA fragments when the sticky ends come together. In this way, any DNA fragment can be spliced between the two ends of a plasmid DNA that has been cut with the same restriction enzyme (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.6" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-1-cloning-and-genetic-engineering/#figure10.6">Figure 10.6</a>).</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_269" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-269" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4612" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1.jpg" alt="An illustration showing the steps in creating recombinant DNA plasmids, inserting them into bacteria, and then selecting only the bacteria that have successfully taken up the recombinant plasmid. The steps are as follows: both foreign DNA and a plasmid are cut with the same restriction enzyme. The restriction site occurs only once in the plasmid in the middle of a gene for an enzyme (lacZ). The restriction enzyme leaves complementary sticky ends on the foreign DNA fragment and the plasmid. This allows the foreign DNA to be inserted into the plasmid when the sticky ends anneal. Adding DNA ligase reattaches the DNA backbones. These are recombinant plasmids. The plasmids are combined with a culture of living bacteria. Many of the bacteria do not take any plasmids into their cells, many take plasmids that do not have the foreign DNA in them, and a few take up the recombinant plasmid. The bacteria that take up the recombinant plasmid cannot make the enzyme from the gene that the fragment was inserted into (lacZ). They also carry a gene for resistance to the antibiotic ampicillin, which was on the original plasmid. To find the bacteria with the recombinant plasmid, the bacteria are grown on a plate with the antibiotic ampicillin and a substance that changes color when exposed to the enzyme produced by the lacZ gene. The ampicillin will kill any bacteria that did not take up a plasmid. The color of the substance will not change when the gene for lacZ contains the foreign DNA insert. These are the bacteria with the recombinant plasmid that we want to grow." width="500" height="650" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1.jpg 788w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1-231x300.jpg 231w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1-768x998.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1-65x84.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1-225x292.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_05-788x1024-1-350x455.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-269">Figure 10.6 This diagram shows the steps involved in molecular cloning.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp51086160">Plasmids with foreign DNA inserted into them are called recombinant DNA molecules because they contain new combinations of genetic material.

Most multicellular organisms undergo reproduction by sexual means, which involves the contribution of DNA from two individuals (parents), making it impossible to generate an identical copy or a clone of either parent. Recent advances in biotechnology have made it possible to reproductively clone mammals in the laboratory.</p> <p id="fs-idm11047552">Natural sexual reproduction involves the union, during fertilization, of a sperm and an egg. Each of these gametes is haploid, meaning they contain one set of chromosomes in their nuclei. The resulting cell, or zygote, is then diploid and contains two sets of chromosomes. This cell divides mitotically to produce a multicellular organism. However, the union of just any two cells cannot produce a viable zygote; there are components in the cytoplasm of the egg cell that are essential for the early development of the embryo during its first few cell divisions. Without these provisions, there would be no subsequent development. Therefore, to produce a new individual, both a diploid genetic complement and an egg cytoplasm are required. The approach to producing an artificially cloned individual is to take the egg cell of one individual and to remove the haploid nucleus. Then a diploid nucleus from a body cell of a second individual, the donor, is put into the egg cell. The egg is then stimulated to divide so that development proceeds. This sounds simple, but in fact it takes many attempts before each of the steps is completed successfully.</p> <p id="fs-idp65851168">The first cloned agricultural animal was Dolly, a sheep who was born in 1996. The success rate of reproductive cloning at the time was very low. Dolly lived for six years and died of a lung tumor (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.7" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-1-cloning-and-genetic-engineering/#figure10.7">Figure 10.7</a>). There was speculation that because the cell DNA that gave rise to Dolly came from an older individual, the age of the DNA may have affected her life expectancy. Since Dolly, several species of animals (such as horses, bulls, and goats) have been successfully cloned.</p> <p id="fs-idp100235504">There have been attempts at producing cloned human embryos as sources of embryonic stem cells. In the procedure, the DNA from an adult human is introduced into a human egg cell, which is then stimulated to divide. The technology is similar to the technology that was used to produce Dolly, but the embryo is never implanted into a surrogate mother. The cells produced are called embryonic stem cells because they have the capacity to develop into many different kinds of cells, such as muscle or nerve cells. The stem cells could be used to research and ultimately provide therapeutic applications, such as replacing damaged tissues. The benefit of cloning in this instance is that the cells used to regenerate new tissues would be a perfect match to the donor of the original DNA. For example, a leukemia patient would not require a sibling with a tissue match for a bone-marrow transplant.</p> <div id="fs-idm48742944" class="art-connection"><div id="figure10.7"></div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_270" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-270" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_06.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_01_06.png"><img class="wp-image-4613" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_01_06.png" alt="The illustration shows the steps in cloning the sheep named Dolly.

Addition of foreign DNA in the form of recombinant DNA vectors that are generated by molecular cloning is the most common method of genetic engineering. An organism that receives the recombinant DNA is called a genetically modified organism (GMO). If the foreign DNA that is introduced comes from a different species, the host organism is called transgenic. Bacteria, plants, and animals have been genetically modified since the early 1970s for academic, medical, agricultural, and industrial purposes. These applications will be examined in more detail in the next module.</p> <div id="fs-idp83171504" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp135598144"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/transgenic.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp61381424">Watch this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transgenic" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/transgenic">short video</a> explaining how scientists create a transgenic animal.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idp75823920">Although the classic methods of studying the function of genes began with a given phenotype and determined the genetic basis of that phenotype, modern techniques allow researchers to start at the DNA sequence level and ask: “What does this gene or DNA element do?” This technique, called reverse genetics, has resulted in reversing the classical genetic methodology. One example of this method is analogous to damaging a body part to determine its function. An insect that loses a wing cannot fly, which means that the wing’s function is flight. The classic genetic method compares insects that cannot fly with insects that can fly, and observes that the non-flying insects have lost wings. Similarly in a reverse genetics approach, mutating or deleting genes provides researchers with clues about gene function. Alternately, reverse genetics can be used to cause a gene to overexpress itself to determine what phenotypic effects may occur.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm6242912"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp132700752">Nucleic acids can be isolated from cells for the purposes of further analysis by breaking open the cells and enzymatically destroying all other major macromolecules.

In some cases in which a genetic disease is present in an individual’s family, family members may be advised to undergo genetic testing. For example, mutations in the <strong><em>BRCA</em> genes</strong> may increase the likelihood of developing breast and ovarian cancers in women and some other cancers in women and men. A woman with breast cancer can be screened for these mutations. If one of the high-risk mutations is found, her female relatives may also wish to be screened for that particular mutation, or simply be more vigilant for the occurrence of cancers.

Just as information technology has led to Google Maps that enable us to get detailed information about locations around the globe, genomic information is used to create similar maps of the DNA of different organisms.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm25293792"><h1>Mapping Genomes</h1> <p id="fs-idp60211744">Genome mapping is the process of finding the location of genes on each chromosome. The maps that are created are comparable to the maps that we use to navigate streets. A genetic map is an illustration that lists genes and their location on a chromosome. Genetic maps provide the big picture (similar to a map of interstate highways) and use genetic markers (similar to landmarks). A genetic marker is a gene or sequence on a chromosome that shows genetic linkage with a trait of interest. The genetic marker tends to be inherited with the gene of interest, and one measure of distance between them is the recombination frequency during meiosis. Early geneticists called this linkage analysis.</p> <p id="fs-idp192808912">Physical maps get into the intimate details of smaller regions of the chromosomes (similar to a detailed road map) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.11" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-3-genomics-and-proteomics/#figure10.11">Figure 10.11</a>). A physical map is a representation of the physical distance, in nucleotides, between genes or genetic markers. Both genetic linkage maps and physical maps are required to build a complete picture of the genome. Having a complete map of the genome makes it easier for researchers to study individual genes. Human genome maps help researchers in their efforts to identify human disease-causing genes related to illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, and cystic fibrosis, to name a few. In addition, genome mapping can be used to help identify organisms with beneficial traits, such as microbes with the ability to clean up pollutants or even prevent pollution. Research involving plant genome mapping may lead to methods that produce higher crop yields or to the development of plants that adapt better to climate change.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.11"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-278" style="width: 260px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4623" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_10_03_01-445x1024-1.jpg" alt="A diagram showing a human chromosome with bands revealed with a Giemsa stain.

It is easy to understand why both types of genome-mapping techniques are important to show the big picture. Information obtained from each technique is used in combination to study the genome. Genomic mapping is used with different model organisms that are used for research. Genome mapping is still an ongoing process, and as more advanced techniques are developed, more advances are expected. Genome mapping is similar to completing a complicated puzzle using every piece of available data. Mapping information generated in laboratories all over the world is entered into central databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Efforts are made to make the information more easily accessible to researchers and the general public. Just as we use global positioning systems instead of paper maps to navigate through roadways, NCBI allows us to use a genome viewer tool to simplify the data mining process.</p> <div id="fs-idp111279216" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp24706464"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/OMIM2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp68739344"><a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/OMIM2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/OMIM2">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM)</a> is a searchable online catalog of human genes and genetic disorders.

Whole genome sequencing is a process that determines the DNA sequence of an entire genome. Whole genome sequencing is a brute-force approach to problem solving when there is a genetic basis at the core of a disease. Several laboratories now provide services to sequence, analyze, and interpret entire genomes.</p> <p id="fs-idp11636832">In 2010, whole genome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, a whole genome sequence revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully diagnosed using whole genome sequencing.</p> <p id="fs-idp145835872">The first genomes to be sequenced, such as those belonging to viruses, bacteria, and yeast, were smaller in terms of the number of nucleotides than the genomes of multicellular organisms. The genomes of other model organisms, such as the mouse (<em>Mus musculus</em>), the fruit fly (<em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>), and the nematode (<em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em>) are now known. A great deal of basic research is performed in model organisms because the information can be applied to other organisms. A model organism is a species that is studied as a model to understand the biological processes in other species that can be represented by the model organism. For example, fruit flies are able to metabolize alcohol like humans, so the genes affecting sensitivity to alcohol have been studied in fruit flies in an effort to understand the variation in sensitivity to alcohol in humans. Having entire genomes sequenced helps with the research efforts in these model organisms (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.12" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-3-genomics-and-proteomics/#figure10.12">Figure 10.12</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.12"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-280" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4625" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02.jpg" alt="Five photos are of the mouse, Mus musculus; the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster; the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, viewed through a scanning electron microscope; the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, seen in a differential interference contrast light micrograph; and a small white flower, Arabidopsis thaliana" width="500" height="327" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02-300x196.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02-768x502.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02-225x147.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_02-350x229.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-280">Figure 10.12 Much basic research is done with model organisms, such as the mouse, Mus musculus; the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster; the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans; the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae; and the common weed, Arabidopsis thaliana.

Genomics is now being used in a wide variety of fields, such as metagenomics, pharmacogenomics, and mitochondrial genomics. The most commonly known application of genomics is to understand and find cures for diseases.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp27018528"><h2>Predicting Disease Risk at the Individual Level</h2> <p id="fs-idp68756672">Predicting the risk of disease involves screening and identifying currently healthy individuals by genome analysis at the individual level. Intervention with lifestyle changes and drugs can be recommended before disease onset. However, this approach is most applicable when the problem arises from a single gene mutation. Such defects only account for about 5 percent of diseases found in developed countries. Most of the common diseases, such as heart disease, are multifactorial or polygenic, which refers to a phenotypic characteristic that is determined by two or more genes, and also environmental factors such as diet. In April 2010, scientists at Stanford University published the genome analysis of a healthy individual (Stephen Quake, a scientist at Stanford University, who had his genome sequenced); the analysis predicted his propensity to acquire various diseases. A risk assessment was done to analyze Quake’s percentage of risk for 55 different medical conditions. A rare genetic mutation was found that showed him to be at risk for sudden heart attack. He was also predicted to have a 23 percent risk of developing prostate cancer and a 1.4 percent risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. The scientists used databases and several publications to analyze the genomic data. Even though genomic sequencing is becoming more affordable and analytical tools are becoming more reliable, ethical issues surrounding genomic analysis at a population level remain to be addressed. For example, could such data be legitimately used to charge more or less for insurance or to affect credit ratings?</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp55747840"><h2>Genome-wide Association Studies</h2> <p id="fs-idp51593280">Since 2005, it has been possible to conduct a type of study called a genome-wide association study, or GWAS. A GWAS is a method that identifies differences between individuals in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that may be involved in causing diseases. The method is particularly suited to diseases that may be affected by one or many genetic changes throughout the genome. It is very difficult to identify the genes involved in such a disease using family history information. The GWAS method relies on a genetic database that has been in development since 2002 called the International HapMap Project. The HapMap Project sequenced the genomes of several hundred individuals from around the world and identified groups of SNPs. The groups include SNPs that are located near to each other on chromosomes so they tend to stay together through recombination. The fact that the group stays together means that identifying one marker SNP is all that is needed to identify all the SNPs in the group. There are several million SNPs identified, but identifying them in other individuals who have not had their complete genome sequenced is much easier because only the marker SNPs need to be identified.</p> <p id="fs-idp109647168">In a common design for a GWAS, two groups of individuals are chosen; one group has the disease, and the other group does not. The individuals in each group are matched in other characteristics to reduce the effect of confounding variables causing differences between the two groups. For example, the genotypes may differ because the two groups are mostly taken from different parts of the world. Once the individuals are chosen, and typically their numbers are a thousand or more for the study to work, samples of their DNA are obtained. The DNA is analyzed using automated systems to identify large differences in the percentage of particular SNPs between the two groups. Often the study examines a million or more SNPs in the DNA. The results of GWAS can be used in two ways: the genetic differences may be used as markers for susceptibility to the disease in undiagnosed individuals, and the particular genes identified can be targets for research into the molecular pathway of the disease and potential therapies. An offshoot of the discovery of gene associations with disease has been the formation of companies that provide so-called “personal genomics” that will identify risk levels for various diseases based on an individual’s SNP complement. The science behind these services is controversial.</p> <p id="fs-idp72094064">Because GWAS looks for associations between genes and disease, these studies provide data for other research into causes, rather than answering specific questions themselves. An association between a gene difference and a disease does not necessarily mean there is a cause-and-effect relationship. However, some studies have provided useful information about the genetic causes of diseases. For example, three different studies in 2005 identified a gene for a protein involved in regulating inflammation in the body that is associated with a disease-causing blindness called age-related macular degeneration. This opened up new possibilities for research into the cause of this disease. A large number of genes have been identified to be associated with Crohn’s disease using GWAS, and some of these have suggested new hypothetical mechanisms for the cause of the disease.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp12009408"><h2>Pharmacogenomics</h2> <p id="fs-idp60684016">Pharmacogenomics involves evaluating the effectiveness and safety of drugs on the basis of information from an individual’s genomic sequence. Personal genome sequence information can be used to prescribe medications that will be most effective and least toxic on the basis of the individual patient’s genotype. Studying changes in gene expression could provide information about the gene transcription profile in the presence of the drug, which can be used as an early indicator of the potential for toxic effects. For example, genes involved in cellular growth and controlled cell death, when disturbed, could lead to the growth of cancerous cells. Genome-wide studies can also help to find new genes involved in drug toxicity. The gene signatures may not be completely accurate, but can be tested further before pathologic symptoms arise.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp138057680"><h2>Metagenomics</h2> <p id="fs-idp198173536">Traditionally, microbiology has been taught with the view that microorganisms are best studied under pure culture conditions, which involves isolating a single type of cell and culturing it in the laboratory. Because microorganisms can go through several generations in a matter of hours, their gene expression profiles adapt to the new laboratory environment very quickly. On the other hand, many species resist being cultured in isolation. Most microorganisms do not live as isolated entities, but in microbial communities known as biofilms. For all of these reasons, pure culture is not always the best way to study microorganisms. Metagenomics is the study of the collective genomes of multiple species that grow and interact in an environmental niche. Metagenomics can be used to identify new species more rapidly and to analyze the effect of pollutants on the environment (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.13" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-3-genomics-and-proteomics/#figure10.13">Figure 10.13</a>).

Linking traits to genes or gene signatures helps to improve crop breeding to generate hybrids with the most desirable qualities. Scientists use genomic data to identify desirable traits, and then transfer those traits to a different organism to create a new genetically modified organism, as described in the previous module. Scientists are discovering how genomics can improve the quality and quantity of agricultural production. For example, scientists could use desirable traits to create a useful product or enhance an existing product, such as making a drought-sensitive crop more tolerant of the dry season.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.16"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_284" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-284" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4629" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_06.jpg" alt="A photo of several purple plums and the leaves of the plum tree.

Proteins are composed of amino acids and play important roles in the cell. All enzymes (except ribozymes) are proteins and act as catalysts that affect the rate of reactions. Proteins are also regulatory molecules, and some are hormones. Transport proteins, such as hemoglobin, help transport oxygen to various organs. Antibodies that defend against foreign particles are also proteins. In the diseased state, protein function can be impaired because of changes at the genetic level or because of direct impact on a specific protein.</p> <p id="fs-idp28157664">A proteome is the entire set of proteins produced by a cell type. Proteomes can be studied using the knowledge of genomes because genes code for mRNAs, and the mRNAs encode proteins. The study of the function of proteomes is called proteomics. Proteomics complements genomics and is useful when scientists want to test their hypotheses that were based on genes. Even though all cells in a multicellular organism have the same set of genes, the set of proteins produced in different tissues is different and dependent on gene expression. Thus, the genome is constant, but the proteome varies and is dynamic within an organism. In addition, RNAs can be alternatively spliced (cut and pasted to create novel combinations and novel proteins), and many proteins are modified after translation. Although the genome provides a blueprint, the final architecture depends on several factors that can change the progression of events that generate the proteome.</p> <p id="fs-idp111091104">Genomes and proteomes of patients suffering from specific diseases are being studied to understand the genetic basis of the disease. The most prominent disease being studied with proteomic approaches is cancer (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure10.17" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/10-3-genomics-and-proteomics/#figure10.17">Figure 10.17</a>). Proteomic approaches are being used to improve the screening and early detection of cancer; this is achieved by identifying proteins whose expression is affected by the disease process. An individual protein is called a biomarker, whereas a set of proteins with altered expression levels is called a protein signature. For a biomarker or protein signature to be useful as a candidate for early screening and detection of a cancer, it must be secreted in body fluids such as sweat, blood, or urine, so that large-scale screenings can be performed in a noninvasive fashion. The current problem with using biomarkers for the early detection of cancer is the high rate of false-negative results. A false-negative result is a negative test result that should have been positive. In other words, many cases of cancer go undetected, which makes biomarkers unreliable. Some examples of protein biomarkers used in cancer detection are CA-125 for ovarian cancer and PSA for prostate cancer. Protein signatures may be more reliable than biomarkers to detect cancer cells. Proteomics is also being used to develop individualized treatment plans, which involves the prediction of whether or not an individual will respond to specific drugs and the side effects that the individual may have. Proteomics is also being used to predict the possibility of disease recurrence.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure10.17"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class="bc-figure figure"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-285" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_10_03_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4630" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_10_03_07.jpg" alt="Photo shows a protein pattern analyzer.

Genetic maps provide an outline for the location of genes within a genome, and they estimate the distance between genes and genetic markers on the basis of the recombination frequency during meiosis. Physical maps provide detailed information about the physical distance between the genes. The most detailed information is available through sequence mapping. Information from all mapping and sequencing sources is combined to study an entire genome.</p> <p id="fs-idp10920096">Whole genome sequencing is the latest available resource to treat genetic diseases. Some doctors are using whole genome sequencing to save lives. Genomics has many industrial applications, including biofuel development, agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and pollution control.</p> <p id="fs-idp147508720">Imagination is the only barrier to the applicability of genomics. Genomics is being applied to most fields of biology; it can be used for personalized medicine, prediction of disease risks at an individual level, the study of drug interactions before the conduction of clinical trials, and the study of microorganisms in the environment as opposed to the laboratory. It is also being applied to the generation of new biofuels, genealogical assessment using mitochondria, advances in forensic science, and improvements in agriculture.</p> <p id="fs-idp242365584">Proteomics is the study of the entire set of proteins expressed by a given type of cell under certain environmental conditions. In a multicellular organism, different cell types will have different proteomes, and these will vary with changes in the environment. Unlike a genome, a proteome is dynamic and under constant flux, which makes it more complicated and more useful than the knowledge of genomes alone.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The multicellular bodies of animals consist of tissues that make up more complex organs and organ systems. The organ systems of an animal maintain homeostasis within the multicellular body. These systems are adapted to obtain the necessary nutrients and other resources needed by the cells of the body, to remove the wastes those cells produce, to coordinate the activities of the cells, tissues, and organs throughout the body, and to coordinate the many responses of the individual organism to its environment.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Search for Key Points in Chapter 11</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Animal organs and organ systems constantly adjust to internal and external changes in order to maintain this steady state. Examples of internal conditions maintained homeostatically are the level of blood glucose, body temperature, blood calcium level. These conditions remain stable because of physiologic processes that result in negative feedback relationships. If the blood glucose or calcium rises, this sends a signal to organs responsible for lowering blood glucose or calcium. The signals that restore the normal levels are examples of negative feedback. When homeostatic mechanisms fail, the results can be unfavorable for the animal. Homeostatic mechanisms keep the body in dynamic equilibrium by constantly adjusting to the changes that the body’s systems encounter. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium. Two examples of factors that are regulated homeostatically are temperature and water content. The processes that maintain homeostasis of these two factors are called thermoregulation and osmoregulation.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm66574672"><h1>Homeostasis</h1> <p id="fs-idm19157504">The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a specific value of some aspect of the body or its cells called a set point. While there are normal fluctuations from the set point, the body’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the activities of the system so the value moves back toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If glucose levels in the blood rise after a meal, adjustments are made to lower them and to get the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use.</p> <p id="fs-idp8368784">When a change occurs in an animal’s environment, an adjustment must be made so that the internal environment of the body and cells remains stable. The receptor that senses the change in the environment is part of a feedback mechanism. The stimulus—temperature, glucose, or calcium levels—is detected by the receptor. The receptor sends information to a control center, often the brain, which relays appropriate signals to an effector organ that is able to cause an appropriate change, either up or down, depending on the information the sensor was sending.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp605024"><h1>Thermoregulation</h1> <p id="fs-idp120510288">Animals can be divided into two groups: those that maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, and those that have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environmental temperature. Animals that do not have internal control of their body temperature are called ectotherms. The body temperature of these organisms is generally similar to the temperature of the environment, although the individual organisms may do things that keep their bodies slightly below or above the environmental temperature. This can include burrowing underground on a hot day or resting in the sunlight on a cold day. The ectotherms have been called cold-blooded, a term that may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature.</p> <p id="fs-idp10834144">An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called an endotherm. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity that an ectothermic animal cannot because they generate internal heat that keeps their cellular processes operating optimally even when the environment is cold.</p> <div id="fs-idm30374128" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idm99066560"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/thermoregulate2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idm76006080">Watch this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate2">Discovery Channel video</a> on thermoregulation to see illustrations of the process in a variety of animals.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idm27557920">Animals conserve or dissipate heat in a variety of ways. Endothermic animals have some form of insulation. They have fur, fat, or feathers. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather. Mammals can increase body heat production by shivering, which is an involuntary increase in muscle activity. In addition, arrector pili muscles can contract causing individual hairs to stand up when the individual is cold. This increases the insulating effect of the hair. Humans retain this reaction, which does not have the intended effect on our relatively hairless bodies; it causes “goose bumps” instead. Mammals use layers of fat as insulation also. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual’s ability to conserve heat.</p> <p id="fs-idm6871888">Ectotherms and endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation, the opening up of arteries to the skin by relaxation of their smooth muscles, brings more blood and heat to the body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, cooling the body. Vasoconstriction, the narrowing of blood vessels to the skin by contraction of their smooth muscles, reduces blood flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and vital organs, conserving heat. Some animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins that are flowing next to each other, warming blood returning to the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other internal organs. The countercurrent adaptation is found in dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds.</p> <p id="fs-idp24069904">Some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. They simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same animals may climb onto rocks in the evening to capture heat on a cold desert night before entering their burrows.</p> <p id="fs-idp7862880">Thermoregulation is coordinated by the nervous system (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_290" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-1-homeostasis-and-osmoregulation/#attachment_290">Figure 11.2</a>). The processes of temperature control are centered in the hypothalamus of the advanced animal brain. The hypothalamus maintains the set point for body temperature through reflexes that cause vasodilation or vasoconstriction and shivering or sweating. The sympathetic nervous system under control of the hypothalamus directs the responses that effect the changes in temperature loss or gain that return the body to the set point. The set point may be adjusted in some instances. During an infection, compounds called pyrogens are produced and circulate to the hypothalamus resetting the thermostat to a higher value. This allows the body’s temperature to increase to a new homeostatic equilibrium point in what is commonly called a fever. The increase in body heat makes the body less optimal for bacterial growth and increases the activities of cells so they are better able to fight the infection.</p> <div id="fs-idp51436768" class="art-connection"><div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_290" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-290" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_01_01.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_01_01.png"><img class="wp-image-4639 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_01-300x211-1.png" alt="Flow chart shows how normal body temperature is maintained.

The fluids inside and surrounding cells are composed of water, electrolytes, and nonelectrolytes. An electrolyte is a compound that dissociates into ions when dissolved in water. A nonelectrolyte, in contrast, does not dissociate into ions in water. The body’s fluids include blood plasma, fluid that exists within cells, and the interstitial fluid that exists in the spaces between cells and tissues of the body. The membranes of the body (both the membranes around cells and the “membranes” made of cells lining body cavities) are semipermeable membranes. Semipermeable membranes are permeable to certain types of solutes and to water, but typically cell membranes are impermeable to solutes.</p> <p id="fs-idm4611552">The body does not exist in isolation. There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. Excess water, electrolytes, and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance. Insufficient fluid intake results in fluid conservation by the kidneys. Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences.</p> <p id="fs-idm4212272">Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, interstitial fluid, and intracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily. Since blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm69656080"><h2>Excretory System</h2> <p id="fs-idm46962208">The human excretory system functions to remove waste from the body through the skin as sweat, the lungs in the form of exhaled carbon dioxide, and through the urinary system in the form of urine. All three of these systems participate in osmoregulation and waste removal. Here we focus on the urinary system, which is comprised of the paired kidneys, the ureter, urinary bladder and urethra (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_291" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-1-homeostasis-and-osmoregulation/#attachment_291">Figure 11.3</a>). The kidneys are a pair of bean-shaped structures that are located just below the liver in the body cavity. Each of the kidneys contains more than a million tiny units called nephrons that filter blood containing the metabolic wastes from cells. All the blood in the human body is filtered about 60 times a day by the kidneys. The nephrons remove wastes, concentrate them, and form urine that is collected in the bladder.</p> <p id="fs-idm18998544">Internally, the kidney has three regions—an outer cortex, a medulla in the middle, and the renal pelvis, which is the expanded end of the ureter. The renal cortex contains the nephrons—the functional unit of the kidney. The renal pelvis collects the urine and leads to the ureter on the outside of the kidney. The ureters are urine-bearing tubes that exit the kidney and empty into the urinary bladder.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-291" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4640" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1.jpg" alt="Illustration on the left shows the placement of the kidneys and bladder in a human man. The two kidneys face one another and are located on the posterior side, about halfway up the back. A renal artery and a renal vein extend from the inside middle of each kidney, toward a major blood vessel that runs up the middle of the body. A ureter runs down from each kidney to the bladder, a sac that sits just above the pelvis. The urethra runs down from the bottom of the bladder and through the penis. The adrenal glands are lumpy masses that sit on top of the kidneys. The illustration on the right shows a kidney, shaped like a kidney bean standing on end. The inside of the kidney consists of three layers: the outer cortex, the middle medulla and the inner renal pelvis. The renal pelvis is flush with the concave side of the kidney, and empties into the ureter, a tube that runs down outside the concave side of the kidney. Several renal pyramids are embedded in the medulla, which is the thickest kidney layer. Each renal pyramid is teardrop-shaped, with the narrow end facing the renal pelvis. The renal artery and renal vein enter the concave part of the kidney, just above the ureter. The renal artery and renal vein branch into arterioles and venules, respectively, which extend into the kidney and branch into capillaries in the cortex." width="500" height="240" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1-300x144.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1-768x369.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1-65x31.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1-225x108.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_01_02-1024x492-1-350x168.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-291">Figure 11.3 The human excretory system is made up of the kidneys, ureter, urinary bladder, and urethra.

It is distributed in smaller vessels until it reaches each nephron in capillaries. Within the nephron the blood comes in intimate contact with the waste-collecting tubules in a structure called the glomerulus. Water and many solutes present in the blood, including ions of sodium, calcium, magnesium, and others; as well as wastes and valuable substances such as amino acids, glucose and vitamins, leave the blood and enter the tubule system of the nephron. As materials pass through the tubule much of the water, required ions, and useful compounds are reabsorbed back into the capillaries that surround the tubules leaving the wastes behind. Some of this reabsorption requires active transport and consumes ATP. Some wastes, including ions and some drugs remaining in the blood, diffuse out of the capillaries into the interstitial fluid and are taken up by the tubule cells. These wastes are then actively secreted into the tubules. The blood then collects in larger and larger vessels and leaves the kidney in the renal vein. The renal vein joins the inferior vena cava, the main vein that returns blood to the heart from the lower body. The amounts of water and ions reabsorbed into the circulatory system are carefully regulated and this is an important way the body regulates its water content and ion levels. The waste is collected in larger tubules and then leaves the kidney in the ureter, which leads to the bladder where urine, the combination of waste materials and water, is stored.</p> <p id="fs-idm48058800">The bladder contains sensory nerves, stretch receptors that signal when it needs to be emptied. These signals create the urge to urinate, which can be voluntarily suppressed up to a limit. The conscious decision to urinate sets in play signals that open the sphincters, rings of smooth muscle that close off the opening, to the urethra that allows urine to flow out of the bladder and the body.</p> <div id="fs-idm108221440" class="career non-majors"><h2 id="fs-idm83146400">Dialysis Technician</h2> <p>Dialysis is a medical process of removing wastes and excess water from the blood by diffusion and ultrafiltration. When kidney function fails, dialysis must be done to artificially rid the body of wastes and fluids. This is a vital process to keep patients alive. In some cases, the patients undergo artificial dialysis until they are eligible for a kidney transplant. In others who are not candidates for kidney transplants, dialysis is a lifelong necessity.</p> <p id="fs-idm14421888">Dialysis technicians typically work in hospitals and clinics. While some roles in this field include equipment development and maintenance, most dialysis technicians work in direct patient care. Their on-the-job duties, which typically occur under the direct supervision of a registered nurse, focus on providing dialysis treatments. This can include reviewing patient history and current condition, assessing and responding to patient needs before and during treatment, and monitoring the dialysis process. Treatment may include taking and reporting a patient’s vital signs, preparing solutions and equipment to ensure accurate and sterile procedures.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm12423696"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm52075296">Homeostasis is a dynamic equilibrium that is maintained in body tissues and organs. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the systems encounter. It is an equilibrium because body functions are kept within a normal range, with some fluctuations around a set point. The kidneys are the main osmoregulatory organs in mammalian systems; they function to filter blood and maintain the dissolved ion concentrations of body fluids. They are made up internally of three distinct regions—the cortex, medulla, and pelvis. The blood vessels that transport blood into and out of the kidneys arise from and merge with the aorta and inferior vena cava, respectively. The nephron is the functional unit of the kidney, which actively filters blood and generates urine. The urine leaves the kidney through the ureter and is stored in the urinary bladder. Urine is voided from the body through the urethra.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

While plants can obtain nutrients from their roots and the energy molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars. However, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular function. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multistep process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, which are later absorbed by the body. This happens by both physical means, such as chewing, and by chemical means.</p> <p id="fs-idm67212608">One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure. Taking in more food energy than is used in activity leads to storage of the excess in the form of fat deposits. The rise in obesity and the resulting diseases like type 2 diabetes makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp106585232"><h1>The Human Digestive System</h1> <p id="fs-idp19432176">The process of digestion begins in the mouth with the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The food is then swallowed and enters the esophagus—a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth-muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food toward the stomach. The stomach contents are extremely acidic, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. This acidity kills microorganisms, breaks down food tissues, and activates digestive enzymes. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where bile produced by the liver, and enzymes produced by the small intestine and the pancreas, continue the process of digestion. The smaller molecules are absorbed into the blood stream through the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestine. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the anus.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-293" style="width: 421px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4643" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_16_02_01.jpg" alt="The basic components of the human digestive system begins at the mouth.

The food is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food to begin the process of physically breaking it down into smaller particles.</p> <p id="fs-idp71813728">The chemical process of digestion begins during chewing as food mixes with saliva, produced by the salivary glands (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch16_02_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-2-digestive-system/#fig-ch16_02_02">Figure 11.5</a>). Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains lysozyme, which has antibacterial action. It also contains an enzyme called salivary amylase that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called lipase is produced by cells in the tongue to break down fats. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the bolus for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing—moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the esophagus and the trachea. The esophagus leads to the stomach and the trachea leads to the lungs. The epiglottis is a flap of tissue that covers the tracheal opening during swallowing to prevent food from entering the lungs.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch16_02_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_294" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-294" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4644 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_02_02-300x151-1.jpg" alt="Illustration A shows the parts of the human oral cavity.

The chewed and softened food passes through the esophagus after being swallowed. The smooth muscles of the esophagus undergo peristalsis that pushes the food toward the stomach. The peristaltic wave is unidirectional—it moves food from the mouth to the stomach, and reverse movement is not possible, except in the case of the vomit reflex. The peristaltic movement of the esophagus is an involuntary reflex; it takes place in response to the act of swallowing.</p> <p id="fs-idp1350656">Ring-like muscles called sphincters form valves in the digestive system. The gastro-esophageal sphincter (or cardiac sphincter) is located at the stomach end of the esophagus. In response to swallowing and the pressure exerted by the bolus of food, this sphincter opens, and the bolus enters the stomach. When there is no swallowing action, this sphincter is shut and prevents the contents of the stomach from traveling up the esophagus. Acid reflux or “heartburn” occurs when the acidic digestive juices escape into the esophagus.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm51666720"><h2>Stomach</h2> <p id="fs-idp49934816">A large part of protein digestion occurs in the stomach (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch16_02_04" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-2-digestive-system/#fig-ch16_02_04">Figure 11.7</a>). The stomach is a saclike organ that secretes gastric digestive juices.</p> <p id="fs-idp103130352">Protein digestion is carried out by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. The highly acidic environment kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the catabolism of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach caused by contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called chyme. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by hormones, stomach distension and muscular reflexes that influence the pyloric sphincter.</p> <p id="fs-idp40282640">The stomach lining is unaffected by pepsin and the acidity because pepsin is released in an inactive form and the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp29510640"><h2>Small Intestine</h2> <p id="fs-idm93330720">Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The small intestine is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like projections called the villi. The top surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. The epithelial cells of these structures absorb nutrients from the digested food and release them to the bloodstream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the small intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients.</p> <p id="fs-idp62937456">The human small intestine is over 6 m (19.6 ft) long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum and the ileum. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter. The chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices, an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme from the stomach. Pancreatic juices contain several digestive enzymes that break down starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. Bile is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder; it enters the duodenum through the bile duct. Bile contains bile salts, which make lipids accessible to the water-soluble enzymes. The monosaccharides, amino acids, bile salts, vitamins, and other nutrients are absorbed by the cells of the intestinal lining.</p> <p id="fs-idm19661728">The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements. The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans has a minor role in immunity.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm45747712"><h2>Large Intestine</h2> <p id="fs-idp10967968">The large intestine reabsorbs the water from indigestible food material and processes the waste material (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch16_02_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-2-digestive-system/#fig-ch16_02_03">Figure 11.6</a>). The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestive processes. The colon has four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch16_02_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_295" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-295" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4645 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_02_03.jpg" alt="Illustration shows the structure of the large intestine, which begins with the ascending colon.

The feces are propelled using peristaltic movements during elimination. The anus is an opening at the far-end of the digestive tract and is the exit point for the waste material.

Accessory organs add secretions and enzymes that break down food into nutrients. Accessory organs include the salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gall bladder. The secretions of the liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to food consumption.</p> <p id="fs-idp35034288">The liver is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays an important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood.

During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy within the cells of the body. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme necessary to digest cellulose (fiber). The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. These plant fibers are known as dietary fiber and are an important component of the diet. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored for later use in the liver and muscle tissue. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage. Fats are stored under the skin of mammals for insulation and energy reserves.</p> <p id="fs-idp42244592">Proteins in food are broken down during digestion and the resulting amino acids are absorbed. All of the proteins in the body must be formed from these amino-acid constituents; no proteins are obtained directly from food.</p> <p id="fs-idp55540688">Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy, and fatty acids are required for the construction of lipid membranes. Fats are also required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.</p> <p id="fs-idm32492512">While the animal body can synthesize many of the molecules required for function from precursors, there are some nutrients that must be obtained from food. These nutrients are termed essential nutrients, meaning they must be eaten, because the body cannot produce them.</p> <p id="fs-idp88033664">The fatty acids omega-3 alpha-linolenic acid and omega-6 linoleic acid are essential fatty acids needed to make some membrane phospholipids. Vitamins are another class of essential organic molecules that are required in small quantities. Many of these assist enzymes in their function and, for this reason, are called coenzymes. Absence or low levels of vitamins can have a dramatic effect on health. Minerals are another set of inorganic essential nutrients that must be obtained from food. Minerals perform many functions, from muscle and nerve function, to acting as enzyme cofactors. Certain amino acids also must be procured from food and cannot be synthesized by the body. These amino acids are the “essential” amino acids. The human body can synthesize only 11 of the 20 required amino acids; the rest must be obtained from food.</p> <div id="fs-idm13706768" class="everyday non-majors"><h2 id="fs-idp3495120">Obesity</h2> <p>With obesity at high rates in the United States, there is a public health focus on reducing obesity and associated health risks, which include diabetes, colon and breast cancer, and cardiovascular disease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity?</p> <p id="fs-idm1942128">Fatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. One gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content. Greater amounts of food energy taken in than the body’s requirements will result in storage of the excess in fat deposits.</p> <p id="fs-idm17000688">Excess carbohydrate is used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. When glycogen stores are full, additional glucose is converted into fatty acids. These fatty acids are stored in adipose tissue cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use.</p> <p id="fs-idp48604288">The rate of obesity among children is rapidly rising in the United States. To combat childhood obesity and ensure that children get a healthy start in life, in 2010 First Lady Michelle Obama launched the Let’s Move! campaign. The goal of this campaign is to educate parents and caregivers on providing healthy nutrition and encouraging active lifestyles in future generations. This program aims to involve the entire community, including parents, teachers, and healthcare providers to ensure that children have access to healthy foods—more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains—and consume fewer calories from processed foods. Another goal is to ensure that children get physical activity. With the increase in television viewing and stationary pursuits such as video games, sedentary lifestyles have become the norm.

The mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has an extremely acidic environment. The enzyme pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination.</p> <p id="fs-idp139650880">Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food. Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in adipose tissue. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The human circulatory system has a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the body. This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste compounds.</p> <p id="fs-idp35726032">The medium for transport of gases and other molecules is the blood, which continually circulates through the system. Pressure differences within the system cause the movement of the blood and are created by the pumping of the heart.</p> <p id="fs-idp58364976">Gas exchange between tissues and the blood is an essential function of the circulatory system. In humans, other mammals, and birds, blood absorbs oxygen and releases carbon dioxide in the lungs. Thus the circulatory and respiratory system, whose function is to obtain oxygen and discharge carbon dioxide, work in tandem.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp712720"><h1>The Respiratory System (Basic level)</h1> <p id="fs-idm56946064">Take a breath in and hold it. Wait several seconds and then let it out. Humans, when they are not exerting themselves, breathe approximately 15 times per minute on average. This equates to about 900 breaths an hour or 21,600 breaths per day. With every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, it rushes back out. That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. There, oxygen is exchanged for carbon dioxide, which is a cellular waste material. Carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.</p> <p id="fs-idp22904000">Breathing is both a voluntary and an involuntary event. How often a breath is taken and how much air is inhaled or exhaled is regulated by the respiratory center in the brain in response to signals it receives about the carbon dioxide content of the blood. However, it is possible to override this automatic regulation for activities such as speaking, singing and swimming under water.</p> <p id="fs-idm290064">During inhalation the diaphragm descends creating a negative pressure around the lungs and they begin to inflate, drawing in air from outside the body. The air enters the body through the nasal cavity located just inside the nose (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_300" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_300">Figure 11.9</a>). As the air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified by moisture from mucous membranes. These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages by hairs, mucus, and cilia. Air is also chemically sampled by the sense of smell.</p> <p id="fs-idp145608096">From the nasal cavity, air passes through the pharynx (throat) and the larynx (voice box) as it makes its way to the trachea (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_300" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_300">Figure 11.9</a>). The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body. The human trachea is a cylinder, about 25 to 30 cm (9.8–11.8 in) long, which sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the pharynx into the chest cavity to the lungs. It is made of incomplete rings of cartilage and smooth muscle. The cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The trachea is lined with cells that have cilia and secrete mucus. The mucus catches particles that have been inhaled, and the cilia move the particles toward the pharynx.</p> <p id="fs-idp18292256">The end of the trachea divides into two bronchi that enter the right and left lung. Air enters the lungs through the primary bronchi. The primary bronchus divides, creating smaller and smaller diameter bronchi until the passages are under 1 mm (.03 in) in diameter when they are called bronchioles as they split and spread through the lung. Like the trachea, the bronchus and bronchioles are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system’s cues. The final bronchioles are the respiratory bronchioles. Alveolar ducts are attached to the end of each respiratory bronchiole. At the end of each duct are alveolar sacs, each containing 20 to 30 alveoli. Gas exchange occurs only in the alveoli. The alveoli are thin-walled and look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. The alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from the alveoli into the blood. In addition, carbon dioxide will diffuse from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Estimates for the surface area of alveoli in the lungs vary around 100 m<sup>2</sup>. This large area is about the area of half a tennis court. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.</p> <div id="fs-idm30391024" class="art-connection"><div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_300" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-300" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_03_01.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_03_01.png"><img class="wp-image-4651" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_16_03_01.png" alt="The illustration shows the flow of air through the human respiratory system. The nasal cavity is a wide cavity above and behind the nostrils, and the pharynx is the passageway behind the mouth. The nasal cavity and pharynx join and enter the trachea through the larynx. The larynx is somewhat wider than the trachea and flat. The trachea has concentric, ring-like grooves, giving it a bumpy appearance. The trachea bifurcates into two primary bronchi, which are also grooved. The primary bronchi enter the lungs, and branch into secondary bronchi. The secondary bronchi in turn branch into many tertiary bronchi. The tertiary bronchi branch into bronchioles, which branch into terminal bronchioles. Each terminal bronchiole ends in an alveolar sac. Each alveolar sac contains many alveoli clustered together, like bunches of grapes. The alveolar duct is the air passage into the alveolar sac. The alveoli are hollow, and air empties into them. Pulmonary arteries bring deoxygenated blood to the alveolar sac (and thus appear blue), and pulmonary veins return oxygenated blood (and thus appear red) to the heart.

The main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.</p> <p><span id="m44792-fs-idm7613568"></span>All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree, different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere. The environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1285" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_1285">Figure </a>11.10). Diffusion is a slow, passive transport process. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large or thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore, dependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Larger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by a complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1285" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1285" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4652" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure_39_01_01" width="300" height="254" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-65x55.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-225x191.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-350x297.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1285">Figure 11.10 &nbsp;The cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five centimeters in diameter.

In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment. Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which ‘breathe’ through diffusion across the outer membrane (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1286" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_1286">Figure </a>11.11).

Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller than that. Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1287" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_1287">Figure </a>11.12). Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid. Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1287" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4654" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.4.&nbsp; This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.

Mucus is high in water. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs.

The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body. The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1292" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_1292">Figure </a>11.17). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia. The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the trachea’s diameter, which causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. The forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough. Smooth muscle can contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the body’s nervous system.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1291" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1291" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4658" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.8.&nbsp; The trachea and bronchi are made of incomplete rings of cartilage.

In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the <span id="m44792-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1531556"></span><strong>respiratory bronchioles</strong><a id="id814067" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases.</p> <p><span id="m44792-fs-idm13298864"></span>The <strong><span id="m44792-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1531567"></span>terminal bronchioles </strong>subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.10.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1294" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#attachment_1294">Figure </a>11.18). In the acinar region, the<span id="m44792-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1531581"></span><strong>alveolar ducts </strong>are attached to the end of each bronchiole. At the end of each duct are approximately 100 <span id="m44792-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1493474"></span><strong>alveolar sacs,</strong> each containing 20 to 30 <span id="m44792-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1493478"></span><strong>alveoli </strong>that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter. Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. Alveoli are made of thin-walled parenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. Alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the cells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. This organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m<sup>2</sup>. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1293" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1293" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_09.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4660" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_09-1024x682-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.10.&nbsp; Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.

In mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the nasal cavity. Air then travels down the pharynx, through the trachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles, which house the first site of gas exchange. The respiratory bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. Several protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or infection. These include the hair and mucus in the nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate matter before they can enter the system. In the lungs, particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the trachea to be swallowed.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm37496048"><h1>The Circulatory System</h1> <p id="fs-idp48934480">The circulatory system is a network of vessels—the arteries, veins, and capillaries—and a pump, the heart. In all vertebrate organisms this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is largely separated from the body’s other extracellular fluid compartment, the interstitial fluid, which is the fluid bathing the cells. Blood circulates inside blood vessels and circulates unidirectionally from the heart around one of two circulatory routes, then returns to the heart again; this is a closed circulatory system. Open circulatory systems are found in invertebrate animals in which the circulatory fluid bathes the internal organs directly even though it may be moved about with a pumping heart.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm34538992"><h1>The Heart</h1> <p id="fs-idp61797536">The heart is a complex muscle that consists of two pumps: one that pumps blood through pulmonary circulation to the lungs, and the other that pumps blood through systemic circulation to the rest of the body’s tissues (and the heart itself).</p> <p id="fs-idm60820032">The heart is asymmetrical, with the left side being larger than the right side, correlating with the different sizes of the pulmonary and systemic circuits (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.10" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#figure11.10">Figure 11.10</a>). In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation through the major veins: the superior vena cava, which drains blood from the head and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as the inferior vena cava, which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve, which prevents the backflow of blood. After it is filled, the right ventricle contracts, pumping the blood to the lungs for reoxygenation. The left atrium receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. This blood passes through the bicuspid valve to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped into the aorta. The aorta is the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.

The cardiac cycle is the flow of blood through the heart coordinated by electrochemical signals that cause the heart muscle to contract and relax. In each cardiac cycle, a sequence of contractions pushes out the blood, pumping it through the body; this is followed by a relaxation phase, where the heart fills with blood. These two phases are called the systole (contraction) and diastole (relaxation), respectively (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.11" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-3-circulatory-and-respiratory-systems/#figure11.11">Figure 11.21</a>). The signal for contraction begins at a location on the outside of the right atrium. The electrochemical signal moves from there across the atria causing them to contract. The contraction of the atria forces blood through the valves into the ventricles. Closing of these valves caused by the contraction of the ventricles produces a “lub” sound. The signal has, by this time, passed down the walls of the heart, through a point between the right atrium and right ventricle. The signal then causes the ventricles to contract. The ventricles contract together forcing blood into the aorta and the pulmonary arteries. Closing of the valves to these arteries caused by blood being drawn back toward the heart during ventricular relaxation produces a monosyllabic “dub” sound.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure11.11"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-303" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4664 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_03_03-300x174-1.jpg" alt="Illustration A shows cardiac diastole.

Illustration B shows atrial systole; the atria contract, pushing blood into the ventricles, which are relaxed. Illustration C shows atrial diastole; after the atria relax, the ventricles contract, pushing blood out of the heart. The sinoatrial node is located at the top of the right atrium, and the atrioventricular node is located between the right atrium and right ventricle. The heartbeat begins with an electrical impulse at the sinoatrial node, which spreads throughout the walls of the atria, resulting in a bump in the ECG reading. The signal then coalesces at the atrioventricular node, causing the ECG reading to flat-line briefly. Next, the signal passes from the atrioventricular node to the Purkinje fibers, which travel from the atriovenricular node and down the middle of the heart, between the two ventricles, then up the sides of the ventricles. As the signal passes down the Purkinje fibers the ECG reading falls. The signal then spreads throughout the ventricle walls, and the ventricles contract, resulting in a sharp spike in the ECG. The spike is followed by a flat-line, longer than the first, then a bump." width="300" height="174" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_03_03-300x174-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_03_03-300x174-1-65x38.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_03_03-300x174-1-225x131.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-303">Figure 11.21 In each cardiac cycle, a series of contractions (systoles) and relaxations (diastoles) pumps blood through the heart and through the body.

Arteries take blood away from the heart. The main artery of the systemic circulation is the aorta; it branches into major arteries that take blood to different limbs and organs. The aorta and arteries near the heart have heavy but elastic walls that respond to and smooth out the pressure differences caused by the beating heart. Arteries farther away from the heart have more muscle tissue in their walls that can constrict to affect flow rates of blood. The major arteries diverge into minor arteries, and then smaller vessels called arterioles, to reach more deeply into the muscles and organs of the body.</p> <p id="fs-idp60259552">Arterioles diverge into capillary beds. Capillary beds contain a large number, 10’s to 100’s of capillaries that branch among the cells of the body. Capillaries are narrow-diameter tubes that can fit single red blood cells and are the sites for the exchange of nutrients, waste, and oxygen with tissues at the cellular level. Fluid also leaks from the blood into the interstitial space from the capillaries. The capillaries converge again into venules that connect to minor veins that finally connect to major veins. Veins are blood vessels that bring blood high in carbon dioxide back to the heart. Veins are not as thick-walled as arteries, since pressure is lower, and they have valves along their length that prevent backflow of blood away from the heart.

The signal for contraction begins in the wall of the right atrium. The electrochemical signal causes the two atria to contract in unison; then the signal causes the ventricles to contract. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The endocrine system coordinates with the nervous system to control the functions of the other organ systems. Cells of the endocrine system produce molecular signals called hormones. These cells may compose endocrine glands, may be tissues or may be located in organs or tissues that have functions in addition to hormone production. Hormones circulate throughout the body and stimulate a response in cells that have receptors able to bind with them. The changes brought about in the receiving cells affect the functioning of the organ system to which they belong. Many of the hormones are secreted in response to signals from the nervous system, thus the two systems act in concert to effect changes in the body.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm23128304"><h1>Hormones</h1> <p id="fs-idp26498448">Maintaining homeostasis within the body requires the coordination of many different systems and organs. One mechanism of communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids, usually blood, which carries them to their target cells where they elicit a response. The cells that secrete hormones are often located in specific organs, called endocrine glands, and the cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of endocrine organs include the pancreas, which produces the hormones insulin and glucagon to regulate blood-glucose levels, the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.</p> <p id="fs-idm89889776">The endocrine glands differ from the exocrine glands. Exocrine glands secrete chemicals through ducts that lead outside the gland (not to the blood). For example, sweat produced by sweat glands is released into ducts that carry sweat to the surface of the skin. The pancreas has both endocrine and exocrine functions because besides releasing hormones into the blood. It also produces digestive juices, which are carried by ducts into the small intestine.</p> <div id="fs-idm58645616" class="career non-majors"><h2 id="fs-idp7963712">Endocrinologist</h2> <p>An endocrinologist is a medical doctor who specializes in treating endocrine disorders. An endocrine surgeon specializes in the surgical treatment of endocrine diseases and glands. Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists include disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves’ disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing’s disease and Addison’s disease).</p> <p id="fs-idp19947360">Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood-glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood-glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood-glucose levels over the past two to three months. The A1C test is an indicator of how well blood glucose is being managed over a long time.</p> <p id="fs-idp40038912">Once a disease such as diabetes has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin’s production or effect. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections.</p> <p id="fs-idp23616">In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp14199952"><h1>How Hormones Work</h1> <p id="fs-idp35845024">Hormones cause changes in target cells by binding to specific cell-surface or intracellular hormone receptors, molecules embedded in the cell membrane or floating in the cytoplasm with a binding site that matches a binding site on the hormone molecule. In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on or in many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors available to respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In up-regulation, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity. When the number of receptors decreases in response to rising hormone levels, called down-regulation, cellular activity is reduced.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm47643632"><h1>Endocrine Glands</h1> <p id="fs-idm55013616">The endocrine glands secrete hormones into the surrounding interstitial fluid; those hormones then diffuse into blood and are carried to various organs and tissues within the body. The endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, adrenal glands, gonads, pineal, and pancreas.</p> <p id="fs-idm56076240">The pituitary gland, sometimes called the hypophysis, is located at the base of the brain (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_307" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#attachment_307">Figure 11.</a>23&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>). It is attached to the hypothalamus. The posterior lobe stores and releases oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone produced by the hypothalamus. The anterior lobe responds to hormones produced by the hypothalamus by producing its own hormones, most of which regulate other hormone-producing glands.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_307" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-307" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_04_01abcd.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_04_01abcd.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4669 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_16_04_01abcd-300x291-1.jpg" alt="The pituitary gland, shown in figure A, sits at the base of the brain, just above the brain stem. It is lobe-shaped and hangs down from the hypothalamus, to which it is connected to via a narrow stalk. The anterior part of the pituitary is toward the front, and the posterior end is toward the back. The parathyroid glands, shown in figure B, are round structures located on the surface of the right and left lobes of the thyroid gland. In the illustration shown, there are two parathyroid glands on each side, and one is located above the other. Shown in figure C, the adrenal glands are lumpy, irregular structures located on top of the kidneys. Figure D shows the pancreas.

Growth hormone stimulates cellular activities like protein synthesis that promote growth. Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands. The other hormones produced by the anterior pituitary regulate the production of hormones by other endocrine tissues (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#table11.1" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#table11.1">Table 11.1</a>). The posterior pituitary is significantly different in structure from the anterior pituitary. It is a part of the brain, extending down from the hypothalamus, and contains mostly nerve fibers that extend from the hypothalamus to the posterior pituitary.</p> <p id="fs-idm49199728">The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just below the larynx and in front of the trachea (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_307" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#attachment_307">Figure 11.23</a>&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>). It is a butterfly-shaped gland with two lobes that are connected. The thyroid follicle cells synthesize the hormone thyroxine, which is also known as T<sub>4</sub> because it contains four atoms of iodine, and triiodothyronine, also known as T<sub>3</sub> because it contains three atoms of iodine. T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4</sub> are released by the thyroid in response to thyroid-stimulating hormone produced by the anterior pituitary, and both T3 and T4 have the effect of stimulating metabolic activity in the body and increasing energy use. A third hormone, calcitonin, is also produced by the thyroid. Calcitonin is released in response to rising calcium ion concentrations in the blood and has the effect of reducing those levels.</p> <p id="fs-idp81080784">Most people have four parathyroid glands; however, the number can vary from two to six. These glands are located on the posterior surface of the thyroid gland (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_307" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#attachment_307">Figure 11.23</a>&nbsp;<strong>b</strong>).</p> <p id="fs-idm51802816">The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone. Parathyroid hormone increases blood calcium concentrations when calcium ion levels fall below normal.</p> <p id="fs-idm71399152">The adrenal glands are located on top of each kidney (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_307" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#attachment_307">Figure 11.23</a>&nbsp;<strong>c</strong>). The adrenal glands consist of an outer adrenal cortex and an inner adrenal medulla. These regions secrete different hormones.</p> <p id="fs-idp33970752">The adrenal cortex produces mineralocorticoids, glucocorticoids, and androgens. The main mineralocorticoid is aldosterone, which regulates the concentration of ions in urine, sweat, and saliva. Aldosterone release from the adrenal cortex is stimulated by a decrease in blood concentrations of sodium ions, blood volume, or blood pressure, or by an increase in blood potassium levels. The glucocorticoids maintain proper blood-glucose levels between meals. They also control a response to stress by increasing glucose synthesis from fats and proteins and interact with epinephrine to cause vasoconstriction. Androgens are sex hormones that are produced in small amounts by the adrenal cortex. They do not normally affect sexual characteristics and may supplement sex hormones released from the gonads. The adrenal medulla contains two types of secretory cells: one that produces epinephrine (adrenaline) and another that produces norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Epinephrine and norepinephrine cause immediate, short-term changes in response to stressors, inducing the so-called fight-or-flight response. The responses include increased heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, and blood-glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue, and redirect blood flow toward skeletal muscles and away from skin and viscera. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system that originate from the hypothalamus.</p> <p id="fs-idm59296432">The pancreas is an elongate organ located between the stomach and the proximal portion of the small intestine (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_307" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-4-endocrine-system/#attachment_307">Figure 11.23</a>&nbsp;<strong>d</strong>). It contains both exocrine cells that excrete digestive enzymes and endocrine cells that release hormones.</p> <p id="fs-idp13885360">The endocrine cells of the pancreas form clusters called pancreatic islets or the islets of Langerhans. Among the cell types in each pancreatic islet are the alpha cells, which produce the hormone glucagon, and the beta cells, which produce the hormone insulin. These hormones regulate blood-glucose levels. Alpha cells release glucagon as blood-glucose levels decline. When blood-glucose levels rise, beta cells release insulin. Glucagon causes the release of glucose to the blood from the liver, and insulin facilitates the uptake of glucose by the body’s cells.</p> <p id="fs-idp21014496">The gonads—the male testes and female ovaries—produce steroid hormones. The testes produce androgens, testosterone being the most prominent, which allow for the development of secondary sex characteristics and the production of sperm cells. The ovaries produce estrogen and progesterone, which cause secondary sex characteristics, regulate production of eggs, control pregnancy, and prepare the body for childbirth.</p> <p id="fs-idm54690640">There are several organs whose primary functions are non-endocrine but that also possess endocrine functions. These include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, and adipose tissue. The heart has endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that release a hormone in response to increased blood volume. It causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> in the blood.</p> <p id="fs-idp39859424">The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.</p> <p id="fs-idm26571600">The kidneys also possess endocrine function. Two of these hormones regulate ion concentrations and blood volume or pressure. Erythropoietin (EPO) is released by kidneys in response to low oxygen levels. EPO triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance. But EPO doping has its risks, since it thickens the blood and increases strain on the heart; it also increases the risk of blood clots and therefore heart attacks and stroke.</p> <p id="fs-idp1802816">The thymus is found behind the sternum. The thymus produces hormones referred to as thymosins, which contribute to the development of the immune response in infants. Adipose tissue, or fat tissue, produces the hormone leptin in response to food intake. Leptin produces a feeling of satiety after eating, reducing the urge for further eating.</p> <table id="table11.1" style="border-color: #000000;" summary=""><caption>Table 11.1 Endocrine Glands and Their Associated Hormones</caption> <thead><tr><th>Endocrine Gland</th> <th>Associated Hormones</th> <th>Effect</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td rowspan="6">Pituitary (anterior)</td> <td>growth hormone</td> <td>promotes growth of body tissues</td> </tr> <tr><td>prolactin</td> <td>promotes milk production</td> </tr> <tr><td>thyroid-stimulating hormone</td> <td>stimulates thyroid hormone release</td> </tr> <tr><td>adrenocorticotropic hormone</td> <td>stimulates hormone release by adrenal cortex</td> </tr> <tr><td>follicle-stimulating hormone</td> <td>stimulates gamete production</td> </tr> <tr><td>luteinizing hormone</td> <td>stimulates androgen production by gonads in males; stimulates ovulation and production of estrogen and progesterone in females</td> </tr> <tr><td rowspan="2">Pituitary (posterior)</td> <td>antidiuretic hormone</td> <td>stimulates water reabsorption by kidneys</td> </tr> <tr><td>oxytocin</td> <td>stimulates uterine contractions during childbirth</td> </tr> <tr><td rowspan="2">Thyroid</td> <td>thyroxine, triiodothyronine</td> <td>stimulate metabolism</td> </tr> <tr><td>calcitonin</td> <td>reduces blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels</td> </tr> <tr><td>Parathyroid</td> <td>parathyroid hormone</td> <td>increases blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels</td> </tr> <tr><td rowspan="2">Adrenal (cortex)</td> <td>aldosterone</td> <td>increases blood Na<sup>+</sup> levels</td> </tr> <tr><td>cortisol, corticosterone, cortisone</td> <td>increase blood-glucose levels</td> </tr> <tr><td>Adrenal (medulla)</td> <td>epinephrine, norepinephrine</td> <td>stimulate fight-or-flight response</td> </tr> <tr><td rowspan="2">Pancreas</td> <td>insulin</td> <td>reduces blood-glucose levels</td> </tr> <tr><td>glucagon</td> <td>increases blood-glucose levels</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm54267536"><h1>Regulation of Hormone Production</h1> <p id="fs-idp54542752">Hormone production and release are primarily controlled by negative feedback, as described in the discussion on homeostasis.

The bones of the skeleton protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.</p> <p id="fs-idp95620864">Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. The most common musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition, which can negatively affect development and maintenance of bones and muscles. Other diseases affect the joints, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and, in advanced cases, completely impair mobility.</p> <p id="fs-idp76004672">Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp49052864"><h1>Skeletal System</h1> <p id="fs-idp122575456">The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that consists of 206 bones in the adult. An endoskeleton develops within the body rather than outside like the exoskeleton of insects. The skeleton has five main functions: providing support to the body, storing minerals and lipids, producing blood cells, protecting internal organs, and allowing for movement. The skeletal system in vertebrates is divided into the axial skeleton (which consists of the skull, vertebral column, and rib cage), and the appendicular skeleton (which consists of limb bones, the pectoral or shoulder girdle, and the pelvic girdle).</p> <div id="fs-idp89032160" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp166261408"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/human_skeleton.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp193318000">Explore the human skeleton by viewing the following <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/human_skeleton" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/human_skeleton">video</a> with digital 3D sculpturing.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idp2097248">The axial skeleton forms the central axis of the body and includes the bones of the skull, ossicles of the middle ear, hyoid bone of the throat, vertebral column, and the thoracic cage (rib cage) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.15" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-5-musculoskeletal-system/#figure11.15">Figure 11.25</a>).</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure11.15"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-311" style="width: 321px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_05_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_05_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4674" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_05_01.jpg" alt="On a human skeleton, the parts of the axial skeleton are highlighted in blue.

(credit: modification of work by Mariana Ruiz Villareal)</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idp11864176">The bones of the skull support the structures of the face and protect the brain. The skull consists of cranial bones and facial bones. The cranial bones form the cranial cavity, which encloses the brain and serves as an attachment site for muscles of the head and neck. In the adult they are tightly jointed with connective tissue and adjoining bones do not move.</p> <p id="fs-idp22699680">The auditory ossicles of the middle ear transmit sounds from the air as vibrations to the fluid-filled cochlea. The auditory ossicles consist of two malleus (hammer) bones, two incus (anvil) bones, and two stapes (stirrups), one on each side. Facial bones provide cavities for the sense organs (eyes, mouth, and nose), and serve as attachment points for facial muscles.</p> <p id="fs-idp105333216">The hyoid bone lies below the mandible in the front of the neck. It acts as a movable base for the tongue and is connected to muscles of the jaw, larynx, and tongue. The mandible forms a joint with the base of the skull. The mandible controls the opening to the mouth and hence, the airway and gut.</p> <p id="fs-idp76041744">The vertebral column, or spinal column, surrounds and protects the spinal cord, supports the head, and acts as an attachment point for ribs and muscles of the back and neck. It consists of 26 bones: the 24 vertebrae, the sacrum, and the coccyx. Each vertebral body has a large hole in the center through which the spinal cord passes down to the level of the first lumbar vertebra. Below this level, the hole contains spinal nerves which exit between the vertebrae. There is a notch on each side of the hole through which the spinal nerves, can exit from the spinal cord to serve different regions of the body. The vertebral column is approximately 70 cm (28 in) in adults and is curved, which can be seen from a side view.</p> <p id="fs-idp77148544">Intervertebral discs composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebrae from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum. Each disc helps form a slightly moveable joint and acts as a cushion to absorb shocks from movements such as walking and running.</p> <p id="fs-idp42511472">The thoracic cage, also known as the rib cage consists of the ribs, sternum, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. The thoracic cage encloses and protects the organs of the thoracic cavity including the heart and lungs. It also provides support for the shoulder girdles and upper limbs and serves as the attachment point for the diaphragm, muscles of the back, chest, neck, and shoulders. Changes in the volume of the thorax enable breathing. The sternum, or breastbone, is a long flat bone located at the anterior of the chest. Like the skull, it is formed from many bones in the embryo, which fuse in the adult. The ribs are 12 pairs of long curved bones that attach to the thoracic vertebrae and curve toward the front of the body, forming the ribcage. Costal cartilages connect the anterior ends of most ribs to the sternum.</p> <p id="fs-idp75082544">The appendicular skeleton is composed of the bones of the upper and lower limbs. It also includes the pectoral, or shoulder girdle, which attaches the upper limbs to the body, and the pelvic girdle, which attaches the lower limbs to the body (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.15" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-5-musculoskeletal-system/#figure11.15">Figure 11.25</a>).</p> <p id="fs-idp143279328">The pectoral girdle bones transfer force generated by muscles acting on the upper limb to the thorax. It consists of the clavicles (or collarbones) in the anterior, and the scapulae (or shoulder blades) in the posterior.</p> <p id="fs-idp78748320">The upper limb contains bones of the arm (shoulder to elbow), the forearm, and the hand. The humerus is the largest and longest bone of the upper limb. It forms a joint with the shoulder and with the forearm at the elbow. The forearm extends from the elbow to the wrist and consists of two bones. The hand includes the bones of the wrist, the palm, and the bones of the fingers.</p> <p id="fs-idp68101648">The pelvic girdle attaches to the lower limbs of the axial skeleton. Since it is responsible for bearing the weight of the body and for locomotion, the pelvic girdle is securely attached to the axial skeleton by strong ligaments. It also has deep sockets with robust ligaments that securely attach to the femur. The pelvic girdle is mainly composed of two large hip bones. The hip bones join together in the anterior of the body at a joint called the pubic symphysis and with the bones of the sacrum at the posterior of the body.</p> <p id="fs-idp26878784">The lower limb consists of the thigh, the leg, and the foot. The bones of the lower limbs are thicker and stronger than the bones of the upper limbs to support the entire weight of the body and the forces from locomotion. The femur, or thighbone, is the longest, heaviest, and strongest bone in the body. The femur and pelvis form the hip joint. At its other end, the femur, along with the shinbone and kneecap, form the knee joint.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp82854128"><h1>Joints and Skeletal Movement</h1> <p id="fs-idp9776912">The point at which two or more bones meet is called a joint, or articulation. Joints are responsible for movement, such as the movement of limbs, and stability, such as the stability found in the bones of the skull.</p> <p id="fs-idm16856800">There are two ways to classify joints: based on their structure or based on their function. The structural classification divides joints into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints depending on the material composing the joint and the presence or absence of a cavity in the joint. The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. There is no cavity, or space, present between the bones, so most fibrous joints do not move at all, or are only capable of minor movements. The joints between the bones in the skull and between the teeth and the bone of their sockets are examples of fibrous joints (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.16" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-5-musculoskeletal-system/#figure11.16">Figure 11.26 </a><strong>a</strong>).</p> <p id="fs-idp114355648">Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.16" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-5-musculoskeletal-system/#figure11.16">Figure 11.26 </a><strong>b</strong>). An example is found at the joints between vertebrae, the so-called “disks” of the backbone. Cartilaginous joints allow for very little movement.</p> <p id="fs-idm1195888">Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space between the adjoining bones (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.16" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-5-musculoskeletal-system/#figure11.16">Figure 11.26 </a><strong>c</strong>). This space is referred to as the joint cavity and is filled with fluid. The fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with cartilage and the entire joint is surrounded by a capsule. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the joint types. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure11.16"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_312" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-312" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_05_02abc.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_05_02abc.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4675" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_05_02abc-1024x391-1.jpg" alt="Illustration A shows sutures that knit the back part of the skull together with the front and lower parts.

(b) Cartilaginous joints are bones connected by cartilage, such as between vertebrae. (c) Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or “synovial cavity” in the joint.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm15669728">The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Flexion, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow is an example of flexion. Extension is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. Movement of the head as in saying “no” is an example of rotation.</p> <div id="fs-idp12896736" class="career non-majors"><h2 id="fs-idp70199152">Rheumatologist</h2> <p>Rheumatologists are medical doctors who specialize in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the joints, muscles, and bones. They diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, plus autoimmune diseases like ankylosing spondylitis, a chronic spinal inflammatory disease and rheumatoid arthritis.</p> <p id="fs-idp12291696">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects synovial joints of the hands, feet, and cervical spine. Affected joints become swollen, stiff, and painful. Although it is known that RA is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, the exact cause of RA remains unknown. Immune cells from the blood enter joints and the joint capsule causing cartilage breakdown and swelling of the joint lining. Breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other causing pain. RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually between 40 to 50 years.</p> <p id="fs-idp112004848">Rheumatologists can diagnose RA based on symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, x-ray and MRI imaging, and blood tests. Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent, such as a dye that is opaque to x-rays. This allows the soft tissue structures of joints—such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments—to be visualized. An arthrogram differs from a regular x-ray by showing the surface of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected.</p> <p id="fs-idp78235280">There is currently no cure for RA; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available. Treatments are divided into those that reduce the symptoms of the disease and those that reduce the damage to bone and cartilage caused by the disease. Early stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints through the use of a cane, or with joint splints that minimize inflammation. When inflammation has decreased, exercise can be used to strengthen muscles that surround the joint and to maintain joint flexibility. If joint damage is more extensive, medications can be used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation. Anti-inflammatory drugs that may be used include aspirin, topical pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections. Surgery may be required in cases where joint damage is severe. Physicians are now using drugs that reduce the damage to bones and cartilage caused by the disease to slow its development. These drugs are diverse in their mechanisms but they all act to reduce the impact of the autoimmune response, for example by inhibiting the inflammatory response or reducing the number of T lymphocytes, a cell of the immune system.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp10623296"><h1>Muscles</h1> <p id="fs-idp13387392">Muscles allow for movement such as walking, and they also facilitate bodily processes such as respiration and digestion.

Notice that skeletal muscle cells are long and cylindrical, they have multiple nuclei, and the small, dark nuclei are pushed to the periphery of the cell. Smooth muscle cells are short, tapered at each end, and have only one nucleus each. Cardiac muscle cells are also cylindrical, but short. The cytoplasm may branch, and they have one or two nuclei in the center of the cell.

Because it can be controlled intentionally, skeletal muscle is also called voluntary muscle. When viewed under a microscope, skeletal muscle tissue has a striped or striated appearance. This appearance results from the arrangement of the proteins inside the cell that are responsible for contraction. The cells of skeletal muscle are long and tapered and have multiple nuclei on the periphery of each cell.</p> <p id="fs-idp13810496">Smooth muscle tissue occurs in the walls of hollow organs such as the intestines, stomach, and urinary bladder, and around passages such as in the respiratory tract and blood vessels. Smooth muscle has no striations, is not under voluntary control, and is called involuntary muscle. Smooth muscle cells have a single nucleus.</p> <p id="fs-idp101919136">Cardiac muscle tissue is only found in the heart. The contractions of cardiac muscle tissue pump blood throughout the body and maintain blood pressure. Like skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle is striated, but unlike skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle cannot be consciously controlled and is called involuntary muscle. The cells of cardiac muscle tissue are connected to each other through intercalated disks and usually have just one nucleus per cell.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp21396480"><h1>Skeletal Muscle Fiber Structure and Function</h1> <p id="fs-idp102925024">Each skeletal muscle fiber is a skeletal muscle cell.

There are two main types of myofilaments: thick filaments and thin filaments. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The primary component of thin filaments is the protein actin.</p> <p id="fs-idp31694096">The thick and thin filaments alternate with each other in a structure called a sarcomere. The sarcomere is the unit of contraction in a muscle cell. Contraction is stimulated by an electrochemical signal from a nerve cell associated with the muscle fiber. For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length. The sliding is accomplished when a molecular extension of myosin, called the myosin head, temporarily binds to an actin filament next to it and through a change in conformation, bends, dragging the two filaments in opposite directions. The myosin head then releases its actin filament, relaxes, and then repeats the process, dragging the two filaments further along each other. The combined activity of many binding sites and repeated movements within the sarcomere causes it to contract. The coordinated contractions of many sarcomeres in a myofibril leads to contraction of the entire muscle cell and ultimately the muscle itself. The movement of the myosin head requires ATP, which provides the energy for the contraction.</p> <div id="fs-idp95609936" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp106800336"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/skeletal_muscl2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp71304048">View this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscl2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscl2">animation</a> to see how muscle fibers are organized.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Sliding Filament Model of Contraction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44788-fs-idm188124656"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Sliding Filament Model of Contraction</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm92961376"></span>For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten.

The mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 11.29).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1278" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4679" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_04-1024x919-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp; When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller.

A sarcomere is defined as the distance between two consecutive Z discs or Z lines; when a muscle contracts, the distance between the Z discs is reduced. The H zone—the central region of the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I band contains only thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same length—but A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments. The zone of overlap, in which thin filaments and thick filaments occupy the same area, increases as the thin filaments move inward.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="ATP and Muscle Contraction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44788-fs-idm31740224"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">ATP and Muscle Contraction</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm103659600"></span>The motion of muscle shortening occurs as myosin heads bind to actin and pull the actin inwards. This action requires energy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idp48454480"></span>ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P<sub>i</sub>. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a “cocked” position. The myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and P<sub>i</sub> are still attached. If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm258599120"></span>If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin and myosin molecules. P<sub>i</sub> is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change. The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm75302080"></span>When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur (Figure 11.30).</p> <div id="m44788-fs-idm185889136" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44788-fs-idp125430800"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/contract_muscle.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm63648336"></span>Watch this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle">video</a> explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.</p> </div> </div> <div id="m44788-fs-idm17471920" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44788-fig-ch38_04_05" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.37.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1280" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_05.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_05.png"><img class="wp-image-4681" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05.png" alt="Figure_38_04_05" width="350" height="516" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05.png 545w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-203x300.png 203w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-65x96.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-225x332.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-350x516.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1280">Figure 11.30.&nbsp; The cross-bridge muscle contraction cycle, which is triggered by Ca2+ binding to the actin active site, is shown.

The axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and ribcage. The skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial bones. Six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear, while the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the mandible. The vertebral column contains 26 bones and surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The thoracic cage consists of the sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. The appendicular skeleton is made up of the upper and lower limbs. The pectoral girdle is composed of the clavicles and the scapulae. The upper limb contains 30 bones in the arm, the forearm, and the hand. The pelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton. The lower limb includes the bones of the thigh, the leg, and the foot.</p> <p id="fs-idp10975792">The structural classification of joints divides them into fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage. Synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. The movement of synovial joints includes angular and rotational. Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis.</p> <p id="fs-idp18186400">The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Muscles are composed of individual cells called muscle fibers. Muscle fibers consist of myofilaments composed of the proteins actin and myosin arranged in units called sarcomeres. Contraction of the muscle occurs by the combined action of myosin and actin fibers sliding past each other when the myosin heads bind to the actin fiber, bend, disengage, and then repeat the process.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls your eye movements and the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. The nervous system is one of two systems that exert control over all the organ systems of the body; the other is the endocrine system. The nervous system’s control is much more specific and rapid than the hormonal system. It communicates signals through cells and the tiny gaps between them rather than through the circulatory system as in the endocrine system. It uses a combination of chemical and electrochemical signals, rather than purely chemical signals used by the endocrine system to cover long distances quickly. The nervous system acquires information from sensory organs, processes it and then may initiate a response either through motor function, leading to movement, or in a change in the organism’s physiological state.</p> <p id="fs-idm571968">Nervous systems throughout the animal kingdom vary in structure and complexity. Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net.” Flatworms have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a ganglion (clusters of connected neurons) and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia. These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain.</p> <p id="fs-idp50887248">Compared to invertebrates, vertebrate nervous systems are more complex, centralized, and specialized. While there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally (toward the stomach) whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally (toward the back). There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow “flipped” during the evolution of vertebrates.</p> <p id="fs-idp52861648">The nervous system is made up of neurons, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and glia, cells that provide support functions for the neurons. There is great diversity in the types of neurons and glia that are present in different parts of the nervous system.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp80394096"><h1>Neurons and Glial Cells</h1> <p id="fs-idp82539600">The nervous system of the common laboratory fly, <em>Drosophila melanogaster</em>, contains around 100,000 neurons, the same number as a lobster. This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.</p> <p id="fs-idp46435504">Most neurons share the same cellular components. But neurons are also highly specialized—different types of neurons have different sizes and shapes that relate to their functional roles.</p> <p id="fs-idp63309536">Like other cells, each neuron has a cell body (or soma) that contains a nucleus, smooth and rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, and other cellular components. Neurons also contain unique structures for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make communication between neurons possible (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_317" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-6-nervous-system/#attachment_317">Figure 11.</a>30). Dendrites are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called synapses. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, most have one or many dendrites.</p> <p id="fs-idp58735824">The bilayer lipid membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through ion channels that span the membrane. Some ion channels need to be activated to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.</p> <p id="fs-idp108718928">A neuron at rest is negatively charged: the inside of a cell is approximately 70 millivolts more negative than the outside (–70 mV). This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell and the selective permeability created by ion channels. Sodium-potassium pumps in the membrane produce the different ion concentrations inside and outside of the cell by bringing in two K<sup>+</sup> ions and removing three Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The actions of this pump are costly: one molecule of ATP is used up for each turn. Up to 50 percent of a neuron’s ATP is used in maintaining its membrane resting potential. Potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>), which are higher inside the cell, move fairly freely out of the neuron through potassium channels; this loss of positive charge produces a net negative charge inside the cell. Sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>), which are low inside, have a driving force to enter but move less freely. Their channels are voltage dependent and will open when a slight change in the membrane potential triggers them.</p> <p id="fs-idm3980640">A neuron can receive input from other neurons and, if this input is strong enough, send the signal to downstream neurons. Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical, called a neurotransmitter, which diffuses from the axon of one neuron to the dendrite of a second neuron. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, the neurotransmitter opens ion channels in the dendrite’s plasma membrane. This opening allows sodium ions to enter the neuron and results in depolarization of the membrane—a decrease in the voltage across the neuron membrane. Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. A large enough signal from neurotransmitters will reach the axon. If it is strong enough (that is, if the threshold of excitation, a depolarization to around –60mV is reached), then depolarization creates a positive feedback loop: as more Na<sup>+</sup> ions enter the cell, the axon becomes further depolarized, opening even more sodium channels at further distances from the cell body. This will cause voltage dependent Na<sup>+</sup> channels further down the axon to open and more positive ions to enter the cell. In the axon, this “signal” will become a self-propagating brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an action potential.</p> <p id="fs-idp68346880">An action potential is an all-or-nothing event; it either happens or it does not. The threshold of excitation must be reached for the neuron to “fire” an action potential. As sodium ions rush into the cell, depolarization actually reverses the charge across the membrane form -70mv to +30mV. This change in the membrane potential causes voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels to open, and K<sup>+</sup> begins to leave the cell, repolarizing it. At the same time, Na<sup>+</sup> channels inactivate so no more Na<sup>+</sup> enters the cell. K<sup>+</sup> ions continue to leave the cell and the membrane potential returns to the resting potential. At the resting potential, the K<sup>+</sup> channels close and Na<sup>+</sup> channels reset. The depolarization of the membrane proceeds in a wave down the length of the axon. It travels in only one direction because the sodium channels have been inactivated and unavailable until the membrane potential is near the resting potential again; at this point they are reset to closed and can be opened again.</p> <p id="fs-idp20311808">An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the signal from the cell body to specialized endings called axon terminals. These terminals in turn then synapse with other neurons, muscle, or target organs. When the action potential reaches the axon terminal, this causes the release of neurotransmitter onto the dendrite of another neuron. Neurotransmitters released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells, and the process begins again. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons do not contain any axons.</p> <p id="fs-idp25167808">Some axons are covered with a special structure called a myelin sheath, which acts as an insulator to keep the electrical signal from dissipating as it travels down the axon. This insulation is important, as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter (3.2 ft)—from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are called nodes of Ranvier and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along the axon.</p> <p id="fs-idp18659392">It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.</p> <div class="" style="text-align: justify;"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_317" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-317" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4684" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_16_06_01-1024x693-1.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a neuron. The main part of the cell body, called the soma, contains the nucleus. Branch-like dendrites project from three sides of the soma. A long, thin axon projects from the fourth side. The axon branches at the end. The tip of the axon is in close proximity to dendrites of an adjacent nerve cell. The narrow space between the axon and dendrites is called the synapse. Cells called oligodendrocytes are located next to the axon. Projections from the oligodendrocytes wrap around the axon, forming a myelin sheath.

Research performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood. Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs. For mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning: about 1,000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and memory) each day. While most of the new neurons will die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task. Interestingly, both exercise and some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Stress has the opposite effect. While neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such as Alzheimer’s, stroke, and epilepsy.</p> <p id="fs-idm60588512">How do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the brain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be incorporated into the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase. A technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated BrdU, and a researcher can use fluorescent microscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch16_06_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-6-nervous-system/#fig-ch16_06_02">Figure 11.</a>31).</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch16_06_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_318" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-318" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4685 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_06_02.jpg" alt="In the micrograph, several cells are fluorescently labeled green only.

Neurons would be unable to function without the vital roles that are fulfilled by these glial cells. Glia guide developing neurons to their destinations, buffer ions and chemicals that would otherwise harm neurons, and provide myelin sheaths around axons. When glia do not function properly, the result can be disastrous—most brain tumors are caused by mutations in glia.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm27605824"><h1>How Neurons Communicate</h1> <p id="fs-idm10973264">All functions performed by the nervous system—from a simple motor reflex to more advanced functions like making a memory or a decision—require neurons to communicate with one another. Neurons communicate between the axon of one neuron and the dendrites, and sometimes the cell body, of another neuron across the gap between them, known as the synaptic cleft. When an action potential reaches the end of an axon it stimulates the release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft between the synaptic knob of the axon and the post-synaptic membrane of the dendrite or soma of the next cell. The neurotransmitter is released through exocytosis of vesicles containing the neurotransmitter molecules. The neurotransmitter diffuses across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors in the post-synaptic membrane. These receptor molecules are chemically regulated ion channels and will open, allowing sodium to enter the cell. If sufficient neurotransmitter has been released an action potential may be initiated in the next cell, but this is not guaranteed. If insufficient neurotransmitter is released the nerve signal will die at this point. There are a number of different neurotransmitters that are specific to neuron types that have specific functions.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp47136496"><h1>The Central Nervous System</h1> <p id="fs-idp65827568">The central nervous system (CNS) is made up of the brain and spinal cord and is covered with three layers of protective coverings called meninges (“meninges” is derived from the Greek and means “membranes”) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure11.21" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-6-nervous-system/#figure11.21">Figure 11.</a>32).

It includes the cerebral cortex, limbic system, basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebellum, brainstem, and retinas. The outermost part of the brain is a thick piece of nervous system tissue called the cerebral cortex. The cerebral cortex, limbic system, and basal ganglia make up the two cerebral hemispheres. A thick fiber bundle called the corpus callosum (corpus = “body”; callosum = “tough”) connects the two hemispheres. Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.</p> <p id="fs-idp108331792">In other surgeries to treat severe epilepsy, the corpus callosum is cut instead of removing an entire hemisphere. This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to verbally identify it.</p> <div id="fs-idp529376" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idp24483424"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/split-brain2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idp23980288">Visit the following <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain2">website</a> to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game where you can model split-brain experiments yourself.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idp23308656">Each hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions.

This lobe contains the olfactory bulb, which processes smells. The frontal lobe also contains the motor cortex, which is important for planning and implementing movement. Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups. Neurons in the frontal lobe also control cognitive functions like maintaining attention, speech, and decision-making. Studies of humans who have damaged their frontal lobes show that parts of this area are involved in personality, socialization, and assessing risk. The parietal lobe is located at the top of the brain. Neurons in the parietal lobe are involved in speech and also reading. Two of the parietal lobe’s main functions are processing somatosensation—touch sensations like pressure, pain, heat, cold—and processing proprioception—the sense of how parts of the body are oriented in space. The parietal lobe contains a somatosensory map of the body similar to the motor cortex. The occipital lobe is located at the back of the brain. It is primarily involved in vision—seeing, recognizing, and identifying the visual world. The temporal lobe is located at the base of the brain and is primarily involved in processing and interpreting sounds. It also contains the hippocampus (named from the Greek for “seahorse,” which it resembles in shape) a structure that processes memory formation. The role of the hippocampus in memory was partially determined by studying one famous epileptic patient, HM, who had both sides of his hippocampus removed in an attempt to cure his epilepsy. His seizures went away, but he could no longer form new memories (although he could remember some facts from before his surgery and could learn new motor tasks).</p> <p id="fs-idp70740192">Interconnected brain areas called the basal ganglia play important roles in movement control and posture. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation.</p> <p id="fs-idp29873760">The thalamus acts as a gateway to and from the cortex. It receives sensory and motor inputs from the body and also receives feedback from the cortex. This feedback mechanism can modulate conscious awareness of sensory and motor inputs depending on the attention and arousal state of the animal. The thalamus helps regulate consciousness, arousal, and sleep states.</p> <p id="fs-idm5793072">Below the thalamus is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls the endocrine system by sending signals to the pituitary gland. Among other functions, the hypothalamus is the body’s thermostat—it makes sure the body temperature is kept at appropriate levels. Neurons within the hypothalamus also regulate circadian rhythms, sometimes called sleep cycles.</p> <p id="fs-idp22225296">The limbic system is a connected set of structures that regulates emotion, as well as behaviors related to fear and motivation. It plays a role in memory formation and includes parts of the thalamus and hypothalamus as well as the hippocampus. One important structure within the limbic system is a temporal lobe structure called the amygdala. The two amygdala (one on each side) are important both for the sensation of fear and for recognizing fearful faces.</p> <p id="fs-idp22218448">The cerebellum (cerebellum = “little brain”) sits at the base of the brain on top of the brainstem. The cerebellum controls balance and aids in coordinating movement and learning new motor tasks. The cerebellum of birds is large compared to other vertebrates because of the coordination required by flight.</p> <p id="fs-idp79668592">The brainstem connects the rest of the brain with the spinal cord and regulates some of the most important and basic functions of the nervous system including breathing, swallowing, digestion, sleeping, walking, and sensory and motor information integration.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp46478560"><h1>Spinal cord</h1> <p id="fs-idp79660064">Connecting to the brainstem and extending down the body through the spinal column is the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is contained within the meninges and the bones of the vertebral column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch16_06_05" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-6-nervous-system/#fig-ch16_06_05">Figure 11.</a>34). Axons make up the “white matter” and neuron and glia cell bodies (and interneurons) make up the “gray matter.” Axons and cell bodies in the dorsa spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.</p> <p id="fs-idp46934192">The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch16_06_05"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_323" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-323" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_16_06_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4690 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_16_06_05.jpg" alt="In the cross section the gray matter forms an X inside the oval white matter.

Parasympathetic preganglionic neurons have cell bodies located in the brainstem and in the sacral (toward the bottom) spinal cord (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_325" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/11-6-nervous-system/#attachment_325">Figure 11.</a>36). The parasympathetic nervous system resets organ function after the sympathetic nervous system is activated including slowing of heart rate, lowered blood pressure, and stimulation of digestion.</p> <p id="fs-idp67056896">The sensory-somatic nervous system is made up of cranial and spinal nerves and contains both sensory and motor neurons. Sensory neurons transmit sensory information from the skin, skeletal muscle, and sensory organs to the CNS. Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which usually has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons usually have only one synapse—one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm86625280"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp83365616">The nervous system is made up of neurons and glia. Neurons are specialized cells that are capable of sending electrical as well as chemical signals. Most neurons contain dendrites, which receive these signals, and axons that send signals to other neurons or tissues. Glia are non-neuronal cells in the nervous system that support neuronal development and signaling. There are several types of glia that serve different functions.</p> <p id="fs-idp44813072">Neurons have a resting potential across their membranes and when they are stimulated by a strong enough signal from another neuron an action potential may carry an electrochemical signal along the neuron to a synapse with another neuron. Neurotransmitters carry signals across synapses to initiate a response in another neuron.</p> <p id="fs-idp47141136">The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges. The brain contains structurally and functionally defined regions. In mammals, these include the cortex (which can be broken down into four primary functional lobes: frontal, temporal, occipital, and parietal), basal ganglia, thalamus, hypothalamus, limbic system, cerebellum, and brainstem—although structures in some of these designations overlap. While functions may be primarily localized to one structure in the brain, most complex functions, like language and sleep, involve neurons in multiple brain regions. The spinal cord is the information superhighway that connects the brain with the rest of the body through its connections with peripheral nerves. It transmits sensory and motor input and also controls motor reflexes.</p> <p id="fs-idp23275824">The peripheral nervous system contains both the autonomic and sensory-somatic nervous systems. The autonomic nervous system provides unconscious control over visceral functions and has two divisions: the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations to prepare the animal for a “fight-or-flight” response. The parasympathetic nervous system is active during restful periods. The sensory-somatic nervous system is made of cranial and spinal nerves that transmit sensory information from skin and muscle to the CNS and motor commands from the CNS to the muscles.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

The vertebrate defense systems, including those of humans, are complex and multilayered, with defenses unique to vertebrates. These unique vertebrate defenses interact with other defense systems inherited from ancestral lineages, and include complex and specific pathogen recognition and memory mechanisms. Research continues to unravel the complexities and vulnerabilities of the immune system.</p> <p id="fs-idm40237920">Despite a poor understanding of the workings of the body in the early 18th century in Europe, the practice of inoculation as a method to prevent the often-deadly effects of smallpox was introduced from the courts of the Ottoman Empire. The method involved causing limited infection with the smallpox virus by introducing the pus of an affected individual to a scratch in an uninfected person. The resulting infection was milder than if it had been caught naturally and mortality rates were shown to be about two percent rather than 30 percent from natural infections. Moreover, the inoculation gave the individual immunity to the disease. It was from these early experiences with inoculation that the methods of vaccination were developed, in which a weakened or relatively harmless (killed) derivative of a pathogen is introduced into the individual. The vaccination induces immunity to the disease with few of the risks of being infected. A modern understanding of the causes of the infectious disease and the mechanisms of the immune system began in the late 19th century and continues to grow today.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Search for Key Points in Chapter 12</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Modern viruses are thought to be a mosaic of bits and pieces of nucleic acids picked up from various sources along their respective evolutionary paths. Viruses are acellular, parasitic entities that are not classified within any domain because they are not considered alive. They have no plasma membrane, internal organelles, or metabolic processes, and they do not divide. Instead, they infect a host cell and use the host’s replication processes to produce progeny virus particles. Viruses infect all forms of organisms including bacteria, archaea, fungi, plants, and animals. Living things grow, metabolize, and reproduce. Viruses replicate, but to do so, they are entirely dependent on their host cells. They do not metabolize or grow, but are assembled in their mature form.</p> <p id="fs-idm85878864">Viruses are diverse. They vary in their structure, their replication methods, and in their target hosts or even host cells. While most biological diversity can be understood through evolutionary history, such as how species have adapted to conditions and environments, much about virus origins and evolution remains unknown.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm88401072"><h1>How Viruses Replicate</h1> <p id="fs-idm25298192">Viruses were first discovered after the development of a porcelain filter, called the Chamberland-Pasteur filter, which could remove all bacteria visible under the microscope from any liquid sample. In 1886, Adolph Meyer demonstrated that a disease of tobacco plants, tobacco mosaic disease, could be transferred from a diseased plant to a healthy one through liquid plant extracts. In 1892, Dmitri Ivanowski showed that this disease could be transmitted in this way even after the Chamberland-Pasteur filter had removed all viable bacteria from the extract. Still, it was many years before it was proven that these “filterable” infectious agents were not simply very small bacteria but were a new type of tiny, disease-causing particle.</p> <p id="fs-idm95265552">Virions, single virus particles, are very small, about 20–250 nanometers (1 nanometer = 1/1,000,000 mm). These individual virus particles are the infectious form of a virus outside the host cell. Unlike bacteria (which are about 100 times larger), we cannot see viruses with a light microscope, with the exception of some large virions of the poxvirus family (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure12.3" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-1-viruses/#figure12.3">Figure 12.3</a>).</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-330" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4699" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_01_02-1024x606-1.jpg" alt="Relative sizes on a logarithmic scale, from 0.1 nm to 1 m, are shown.

They were initially grouped by shared morphology, meaning their size, shape, and distinguishing structures. Later, groups of viruses were classified by the type of nucleic acid they contained, DNA or RNA, and whether their nucleic acid was single- or double-stranded. More recently, molecular analysis of viral replication cycles has further refined their classification.</p> <p id="fs-idm68021440">A virion consists of a nucleic-acid core, an outer protein coating, and sometimes an outer envelope made of protein and phospholipid membranes derived from the host cell. The most visible difference between members of viral families is their morphology, which is quite diverse. An interesting feature of viral complexity is that the complexity of the host does not correlate to the complexity of the virion. Some of the most complex virion structures are observed in bacteriophages, viruses that infect the simplest living organisms, bacteria.</p> <p id="fs-idm80615504">Viruses come in many shapes and sizes, but these are consistent and distinct for each viral family (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure12.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-1-viruses/#figure12.5">Figure 12.5</a>). All virions have a nucleic-acid genome covered by a protective layer of protein, called a capsid. The capsid is made of protein subunits called capsomeres. Some viral capsids are simple polyhedral “spheres,” whereas others are quite complex in structure. The outer structure surrounding the capsid of some viruses is called the viral envelope. All viruses use some sort of glycoprotein to attach to their host cells at molecules on the cell called viral receptors. The virus exploits these cell-surface molecules, which the cell uses for some other purpose, as a way to recognize and infect specific cell types. For example, the measles virus uses a cell-surface glycoprotein in humans that normally functions in immune reactions and possibly in the sperm-egg interaction at fertilization. Attachment is a requirement for viruses to later penetrate the cell membrane, inject the viral genome, and complete their replication inside the cell.</p> <p id="fs-idm41144416">The T4 bacteriophage, which infects the <em>E. coli </em>bacterium, is among the most complex virion known; T4 has a protein tail structure that the virus uses to attach to the host cell and a head structure that houses its DNA.</p> <p id="fs-idm5699840">Adenovirus, a nonenveloped animal virus that causes respiratory illnesses in humans, uses protein spikes protruding from its capsomeres to attach to the host cell. Nonenveloped viruses also include those that cause polio (poliovirus), plantar warts (papillomavirus), and hepatitis A (hepatitis A virus). Nonenveloped viruses tend to be more robust and more likely to survive under harsh conditions, such as the gut.</p> <p id="fs-idm2724240">Enveloped virions like HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), the causative agent in AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), consist of nucleic acid (RNA in the case of HIV) and capsid proteins surrounded by a phospholipid bilayer envelope and its associated proteins (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure12.5" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-1-viruses/#figure12.5">Figure 12.5</a>). Chicken pox, influenza, and mumps are examples of diseases caused by viruses with envelopes. Because of the fragility of the envelope, nonenveloped viruses are more resistant to changes in temperature, pH, and some disinfectants than enveloped viruses.</p> <p id="fs-idm27163520">Overall, the shape of the virion and the presence or absence of an envelope tells us little about what diseases the viruses may cause or what species they might infect, but is still a useful means to begin viral classification.</p> <div id="fs-idm14063840" class="art-connection"><div class="bc-figure figure" id="figure12.5"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-332" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_04.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_04.png"><img class="wp-image-4701" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_01_04.png" alt="An illustration shows bacteriophage T4, which houses its DNA genome in a hexagonal head.

This figure shows three relatively complex virions: the bacteriophage T4, with its DNA-containing head group and tail fibers that attach to host cells; adenovirus, which uses spikes from its capsid to bind to the host cells; and HIV, which uses glycoproteins embedded in its envelope to do so. Notice that HIV has proteins called matrix proteins, internal to the envelope, which help stabilize virion shape. HIV is a retrovirus, which means it reverse transcribes its RNA genome into DNA, which is then spliced into the host’s DNA.

The virus core contains the genome or total genetic content of the virus. Viral genomes tend to be small compared to bacteria or eukaryotes, containing only those genes that code for proteins the virus cannot get from the host cell. This genetic material may be single-stranded or double-stranded. It may also be linear or circular. While most viruses contain a single segment of nucleic acid, others have genomes that consist of several segments.</p> <p id="fs-idm101004656">DNA viruses have a DNA core. The viral DNA directs the host cell’s replication proteins to synthesize new copies of the viral genome and to transcribe and translate that genome into viral proteins. DNA viruses cause human diseases such as chickenpox, hepatitis B, and some venereal diseases like herpes and genital warts.</p> <p id="fs-idm47578144">RNA viruses contain only RNA in their cores. To replicate their genomes in the host cell, the genomes of RNA viruses encode enzymes not found in host cells. RNA polymerase enzymes are not as stable as DNA polymerases and often make mistakes during transcription. For this reason, mutations, changes in the nucleotide sequence, in RNA viruses occur more frequently than in DNA viruses. This leads to more rapid evolution and change in RNA viruses. For example, the fact that influenza is an RNA virus is one reason a new flu vaccine is needed every year. Human diseases caused by RNA viruses include hepatitis C, measles, and rabies.</p> <p id="fs-idp119285008">Viruses can be seen as obligate intracellular parasites. The virus must attach to a living cell, be taken inside, manufacture its proteins and copy its genome, and find a way to escape the cell so the virus can infect other cells and ultimately other individuals. Viruses can infect only certain species of hosts and only certain cells within that host. The molecular basis for this specificity is that a particular surface molecule, known as the viral receptor, must be found on the host cell surface for the virus to attach. Also, metabolic differences seen in different cell types based on differential gene expression are a likely factor in which cells a virus may use to replicate. The cell must be making the substances the virus needs, such as enzymes the virus genome itself does not have genes for, or the virus will not be able to replicate using that cell.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp73314480"><h2>Steps of Virus Infections</h2> <p id="fs-idm38312208">A virus must “take over” a cell to replicate. The viral replication cycle can produce dramatic biochemical and structural changes in the host cell, which may cause cell damage. These changes, called cytopathic effects, can change cell functions or even destroy the cell. Some infected cells, such as those infected by the common cold virus (rhinovirus), die through lysis (bursting) or apoptosis (programmed cell death or “cell suicide”), releasing all the progeny virions at once. The symptoms of viral diseases result from the immune response to the virus, which attempts to control and eliminate the virus from the body, and from cell damage caused by the virus. Many animal viruses, such as HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), leave the infected cells of the immune system by a process known as budding, where virions leave the cell individually. During the budding process, the cell does not undergo lysis and is not immediately killed. However, the damage to the cells that HIV infects may make it impossible for the cells to function as mediators of immunity, even though the cells remain alive for a period of time. Most productive viral infections follow similar steps in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release.</p> <p id="fs-idp1451936">A virus attaches to a specific receptor site on the host-cell membrane through attachment proteins in the capsid or proteins embedded in its envelope. The attachment is specific, and typically a virus will only attach to cells of one or a few species and only certain cell types within those species with the appropriate receptors.</p> <div id="fs-idm95792192" class="interactive non-majors"><h2>Concept in Action</h2> <p><span id="fs-idm8605728"><br /> <img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/influenza2.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></span></p> <p id="fs-idm96461824">View this <a href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza2" target="_window" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/influenza2">video</a> for a visual explanation of how HIV and influenza attack the body.</p> </div> <p id="fs-idm34155552">Unlike animal viruses, the nucleic acid of bacteriophages is injected into the host cell naked, leaving the capsid outside the cell. Plant and animal viruses can enter their cells through endocytosis, in which the cell membrane surrounds and engulfs the entire virus. Some enveloped viruses enter the cell when the viral envelope fuses directly with the cell membrane. Once inside the cell, the viral capsid is degraded and the viral nucleic acid is released, which then becomes available for replication and transcription.</p> <p id="fs-idm16721216">The replication mechanism depends on the viral genome. DNA viruses usually use host cell proteins and enzymes to make additional DNA that is used to copy the genome or be transcribed to messenger RNA (mRNA), which is then used in protein synthesis. RNA viruses, such as the influenza virus, usually use the RNA core as a template for synthesis of viral genomic RNA and mRNA. The viral mRNA is translated into viral enzymes and capsid proteins to assemble new virions (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#figure12.6" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-1-viruses/#figure12.6">Figure 12.6</a>). Of course, there are exceptions to this pattern. If a host cell does not provide the enzymes necessary for viral replication, viral genes supply the information to direct synthesis of the missing proteins. Retroviruses, such as HIV, have an RNA genome that must be reverse transcribed to make DNA, which then is inserted into the host’s DNA. To convert RNA into DNA, retroviruses contain genes that encode the virus-specific enzyme reverse transcriptase that transcribes an RNA template to DNA. The fact that HIV produces some of its own enzymes, which are not found in the host, has allowed researchers to develop drugs that inhibit these enzymes. These drugs, including the reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT, inhibit HIV replication by reducing the activity of the enzyme without affecting the host’s metabolism.</p> <p id="fs-idm51406016">The last stage of viral replication is the release of the new virions into the host organism, where they are able to infect adjacent cells and repeat the replication cycle. Some viruses are released when the host cell dies and other viruses can leave infected cells by budding through the membrane without directly killing the cell.</p> <div id="fs-idm15010720" class="art-connection"><div class="" id="figure12.6"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_334" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-334" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_05.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_01_05.png"><img class="wp-image-4703" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_01_05-1024x735-1.png" alt="The illustration shows the steps of an influenza virus infection.

A vaccine may be prepared using weakened live viruses, killed viruses, or molecular subunits of the virus. In general, live viruses lead to better immunity, but have the possibility of causing disease at some low frequency. Killed viral vaccine and the subunit viruses are both incapable of causing disease, but in general lead to less effective or long-lasting immunity.</p> <p id="fs-idm25151040">Weakened live viral vaccines are designed in the laboratory to cause few symptoms in recipients while giving them immunity against future infections. Polio was one disease that represented a milestone in the use of vaccines. Mass immunization campaigns in the U.S. in the 1950s (killed vaccine) and 1960s (live vaccine) essentially eradicated the disease, which caused muscle paralysis in children and generated fear in the general population when regional epidemics occurred. The success of the polio vaccine paved the way for the routine dispensation of childhood vaccines against measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and other diseases.</p> <p id="fs-idm46097088">Live vaccines are usually made by attenuation (weakening) of the “wild-type” (disease-causing) virus by growing it in the laboratory in tissues or at temperatures different from what the virus is accustomed to in the host. For example, the virus may be grown in cells in a test tube, in bird embryos, or in live animals. The adaptation to these new cells or temperature induces mutations in the virus’ genomes, allowing them to grow better in the laboratory while inhibiting their ability to cause disease when reintroduced into the conditions found in the host. These attenuated viruses thus still cause an infection, but they do not grow very well, allowing the immune response to develop in time to prevent major disease. The danger of using live vaccines, which are usually more effective than killed vaccines, is the low but significant risk that these viruses will revert back to their disease-causing form by back mutations. Back mutations occur when the vaccine undergoes mutations in the host such that it readapts to the host and can again cause disease, which can then be spread to other humans in an epidemic. This happened as recently as 2007 in Nigeria where mutations in a polio vaccine led to an epidemic of polio in that country.</p> <p id="fs-idp37276560">Some vaccines are in continuous development because certain viruses, such as influenza and HIV, have a high mutation rate compared to other viruses or host cells. With influenza, mutation in genes for the surface molecules helps the virus evade the protective immunity that may have been obtained in a previous influenza season, making it necessary for individuals to get vaccinated every year. Other viruses, such as those that cause the childhood diseases measles, mumps, and rubella, mutate so little that the same vaccine is used year after year.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm27222208"><h2>Vaccines and Antiviral Drugs for Treatment</h2> <p id="fs-idm88083792">In some cases, vaccines can be used to treat an active viral infection. In the case of rabies, a fatal neurological disease transmitted in the saliva of rabies virus-infected animals, the progression of the disease from the time of the animal bite to the time it enters the central nervous system may be two weeks or longer. This is enough time to vaccinate an individual who suspects being bitten by a rabid animal, and the boosted immune response from the vaccination is enough to prevent the virus from entering nervous tissue. Thus, the fatal neurological consequences of the disease are averted and the individual only has to recover from the infected bite. This approach is also being used for the treatment of Ebola, one of the fastest and most deadly viruses affecting humans, though usually infecting limited populations. Ebola is also a leading cause of death in gorillas. Transmitted by bats and great apes, this virus can cause death in 70–90 percent of the infected within two weeks. Using newly developed vaccines that boost the immune response, there is hope that immune systems of affected individuals will be better able to control the virus, potentially reducing mortality rates.</p> <p id="fs-idm47130544">Another way of treating viral infections is the use of antiviral drugs. These drugs often have limited ability to cure viral disease but have been used to control and reduce symptoms for a wide variety of viral diseases. For most viruses, these drugs inhibit the virus by blocking the actions of one or more of its proteins. It is important that the targeted proteins be encoded for by viral genes and that these molecules are not present in a healthy host cell. In this way, viral growth is inhibited without damaging the host. There are large numbers of antiviral drugs available to treat infections, some specific for a particular virus and others that can affect multiple viruses.</p> <p id="fs-idm40112512">Antivirals have been developed to treat genital herpes (herpes simplex II) and influenza. For genital herpes, drugs such as acyclovir can reduce the number and duration of the episodes of active viral disease during which patients develop viral lesions in their skins cells. As the virus remains latent in nervous tissue of the body for life, this drug is not a cure but can make the symptoms of the disease more manageable. For influenza, drugs like Tamiflu can reduce the duration of “flu” symptoms by one or two days, but the drug does not prevent symptoms entirely. Other antiviral drugs, such as Ribavirin, have been used to treat a variety of viral infections.</p> <p id="fs-idm66307040">By far the most successful use of antivirals has been in the treatment of the retrovirus HIV, which causes a disease that, if untreated, is usually fatal within 10–12 years after being infected. Anti-HIV drugs have been able to control viral replication to the point that individuals receiving these drugs survive for a significantly longer time than the untreated.</p> <p id="fs-idm102756320">Anti-HIV drugs inhibit viral replication at many different phases of the HIV replicative cycle. Drugs have been developed that inhibit the fusion of the HIV viral envelope with the plasma membrane of the host cell (fusion inhibitors), the conversion of its RNA genome to double-stranded DNA (reverse transcriptase inhibitors), the integration of the viral DNA into the host genome (integrase inhibitors), and the processing of viral proteins (protease inhibitors).</p> <p id="fs-idp44579040">When any of these drugs are used individually, the virus’ high mutation rate allows the virus to rapidly evolve resistance to the drug. The breakthrough in the treatment of HIV was the development of highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART), which involves a mixture of different drugs, sometimes called a drug “cocktail.” By attacking the virus at different stages of its replication cycle, it is difficult for the virus to develop resistance to multiple drugs at the same time. Still, even with the use of combination HAART therapy, there is concern that, over time, the virus will evolve resistance to this therapy. Thus, new anti-HIV drugs are constantly being developed with the hope of continuing the battle against this highly fatal virus.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idp48663056"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idm79578544">Viruses are acellular entities that can usually only be seen with an electron microscope. Their genomes contain either DNA or RNA, and they replicate using the replication proteins of a host cell. Viruses are diverse, infecting archaea, bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals. Viruses consist of a nucleic-acid core surrounded by a protein capsid with or without an outer lipid envelope.</p> <p id="fs-idm49368768">Viral replication within a living cell always produces changes in the cell, sometimes resulting in cell death and sometimes slowly killing the infected cells. There are six basic stages in the virus replication cycle: attachment, penetration, uncoating, replication, assembly, and release. A viral infection may be productive, resulting in new virions, or nonproductive, meaning the virus remains inside the cell without producing new virions.</p> <p id="fs-idm19479328">Viruses cause a variety of diseases in humans. Many of these diseases can be prevented by the use of viral vaccines, which stimulate protective immunity against the virus without causing major disease. Viral vaccines may also be used in active viral infections, boosting the ability of the immune system to control or destroy the virus.

The system can be divided into two types of defense systems: the innate immune system, which is nonspecific toward a particular kind of pathogen, and the adaptive immune system, which is specific (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_02_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-2-innate-immunity/#fig-ch17_02_01">Figure 12.8</a>). Innate immunity is not caused by an infection or vaccination and depends initially on physical and chemical barriers that work on all pathogens, sometimes called the first line of defense. The second line of defense of the innate system includes chemical signals that produce inflammation and fever responses as well as mobilizing protective cells and other chemical defenses. The adaptive immune system mounts a highly specific response to substances and organisms that do not belong in the body. The adaptive system takes longer to respond and has a memory system that allows it to respond with greater intensity should the body reencounter a pathogen even years later.</p> <div class="bc-figure figure" id="fig-ch17_02_01"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-338" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4708" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_02_01-1024x347-1.jpg" alt="Table shows vertebrate immunity, with 2 columns for innate and adaptive immune system characteristics.

The innate immune system, which is made up of physical barriers and internal defenses, responds to all pathogens. The adaptive immune system is highly specific.</div></div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp53318944"><h1>External and Chemical Barriers</h1> <p id="fs-idm31920176">The body has significant physical barriers to potential pathogens. The skin contains the protein keratin, which resists physical entry into cells. Other body surfaces, particularly those associated with body openings, are protected by the mucous membranes. The sticky mucus provides a physical trap for pathogens, preventing their movement deeper into the body. The openings of the body, such as the nose and ears, are protected by hairs that catch pathogens, and the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract have cilia that constantly move pathogens trapped in the mucus coat up to the mouth.</p> <p id="fs-idm28794832">The skin and mucous membranes also create a chemical environment that is hostile to many microorganisms. The surface of the skin is acidic, which prevents bacterial growth. Saliva, mucus, and the tears of the eye contain an enzyme that breaks down bacterial cell walls. The stomach secretions create a highly acidic environment, which kills many pathogens entering the digestive system.</p> <p id="fs-idp53337664">Finally, the surface of the body and the lower digestive system have a community of microorganisms such as bacteria, archaea, and fungi that coexist without harming the body. There is evidence that these organisms are highly beneficial to their host, combating disease-causing organisms and outcompeting them for nutritional resources provided by the host body. Despite these defenses, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the protections of mucus or cilia.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp34394320"><h1>Internal Defenses</h1> <p id="fs-idm6623008">When pathogens enter the body, the innate immune system responds with a variety of internal defenses. These include the inflammatory response, phagocytosis, natural killer cells, and the complement system. White blood cells in the blood and lymph recognize pathogens as foreign to the body. A white blood cell is larger than a red blood cell, is nucleated, and is typically able to move using amoeboid locomotion. Because they can move on their own, white blood cells can leave the blood to go to infected tissues. For example, a monocyte is a type of white blood cell that circulates in the blood and lymph and develops into a macrophage after it moves into infected tissue. A macrophage is a large cell that engulfs foreign particles and pathogens. Mast cells are produced in the same way as white blood cells, but unlike circulating white blood cells, mast cells take up residence in connective tissues and especially mucosal tissues. They are responsible for releasing chemicals in response to physical injury. They also play a role in the allergic response, which will be discussed later in the chapter.</p> <p id="fs-idp25664192">When a pathogen is recognized as foreign, chemicals called cytokines are released. A cytokine is a chemical messenger that regulates cell differentiation (form and function), proliferation (production), and gene expression to produce a variety of immune responses. Approximately 40 types of cytokines exist in humans. In addition to being released from white blood cells after pathogen recognition, cytokines are also released by the infected cells and bind to nearby uninfected cells, inducing those cells to release cytokines. This positive feedback loop results in a burst of cytokine production.</p> <p id="fs-idp51703632">One class of early-acting cytokines is the interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. An interferon is a small protein that signals a viral infection to other cells. The interferons stimulate uninfected cells to produce compounds that interfere with viral replication. Interferons also activate macrophages and other cells.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm57541312"><h2>The Inflammatory Response and Phagocytosis</h2> <p id="fs-idp23392464">The first cytokines to be produced encourage inflammation, a localized redness, swelling, heat, and pain. Inflammation is a response to physical trauma, such as a cut or a blow, chemical irritation, and infection by pathogens (viruses, bacteria, or fungi). The chemical signals that trigger an inflammatory response enter the extracellular fluid and cause capillaries to dilate (expand) and capillary walls to become more permeable, or leaky. The serum and other compounds leaking from capillaries cause swelling of the area, which in turn causes pain. Various kinds of white blood cells are attracted to the area of inflammation. The types of white blood cells that arrive at an inflamed site depend on the nature of the injury or infecting pathogen. For example, a neutrophil is an early arriving white blood cell that engulfs and digests pathogens. Neutrophils are the most abundant white blood cells of the immune system (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_339" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-2-innate-immunity/#attachment_339">Figure 12.9</a>). Macrophages follow neutrophils and take over the phagocytosis function and are involved in the resolution of an inflamed site, cleaning up cell debris and pathogens.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-339" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4709 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a capillary near the surface of skin that has a cut in it.

Cytokines also increase the core body temperature, causing a fever. The elevated temperatures of a fever inhibit the growth of pathogens and speed up cellular repair processes.

Most lymphocytes are associated with the adaptive immune response, but infected cells are identified and destroyed by natural killer cells, the only lymphocytes of the innate immune system. A natural killer (NK) cell is a lymphocyte that can kill cells infected with viruses (or cancerous cells). NK cells identify intracellular infections, especially from viruses, by the altered expression of major histocompatibility class (MHC) I molecules on the surface of infected cells. MHC class I molecules are proteins on the surfaces of all nucleated cells that provide a sample of the cell’s internal environment at any given time. Unhealthy cells, whether infected or cancerous, display an altered MHC class I complement on their cell surfaces.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_341" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-341" style="width: 272px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4711 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_03.jpg" alt="Micrograph shows a round cell with a large nucleus occupying more than half of the cell." width="272" height="272" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_03.jpg 272w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_03-150x150.jpg 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_03-65x65.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_02_03-225x225.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-341">Figure 12.10.

Liver cells and macrophages synthesize inactive forms of complement proteins continuously; these proteins are abundant in the blood serum and are capable of responding immediately to infecting microorganisms. The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the innate and adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already tagged by the adaptive immune system. This “tagging” involves the attachment of specific proteins called antibodies (discussed in detail later) to the pathogen. When they attach, the antibodies change shape providing a binding site for one of the complement proteins. After the first few complement proteins bind, a cascade of binding in a specific sequence of proteins follows in which the pathogen rapidly becomes coated in complement proteins.</p> <p id="fs-idm18352">Complement proteins perform several functions, one of which is to serve as a marker to indicate the presence of a pathogen to phagocytic cells and enhance engulfment.

Adaptive immunity is an immunity that occurs after exposure to an antigen either from a pathogen or a vaccination. An antigen is a molecule that stimulates a response in the immune system. This part of the immune system is activated when the innate immune response is insufficient to control an infection. In fact, without information from the innate immune system, the adaptive response could not be mobilized. There are two types of adaptive responses: the cell-mediated immune response, which is controlled by activated T cells, and the humoral immune response, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies. Activated T and B cells whose surface binding sites are specific to the molecules on the pathogen greatly increase in numbers and attack the invading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or they can secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to give the host long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on reexposure, this host memory will facilitate a rapid and powerful response.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp93002304"><h1>B and T Cells</h1> <p id="fs-idm506240">Lymphocytes, which are white blood cells, are formed with other blood cells in the red bone marrow found in many flat bones, such as the shoulder or pelvic bones. The two types of lymphocytes of the adaptive immune response are B and T cells (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_344" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#attachment_344">Figure 12.12</a>). Whether an immature lymphocyte becomes a B cell or T cell depends on where in the body it matures. The B cells remain in the bone marrow to mature (hence the name “B” for “bone marrow”), while T cells migrate to the thymus, where they mature (hence the name “T” for “thymus”).</p> <p id="fs-idp24733648">Maturation of a B or T cell involves becoming immunocompetent, meaning that it can recognize, by binding, a specific molecule or antigen (discussed below). During the maturation process, B and T cells that bind too strongly to the body’s own cells are eliminated in order to minimize an immune response against the body’s own tissues. Those cells that react weakly to the body’s own cells, but have highly specific receptors on their cell surfaces that allow them to recognize a foreign molecule, or antigen, remain. This process occurs during fetal development and continues throughout life. The specificity of this receptor is determined by the genetics of the individual and is present before a foreign molecule is introduced to the body or encountered. Thus, it is genetics and not experience that initially provides a vast array of cells, each capable of binding to a different specific foreign molecule. Once they are immunocompetent, the T and B cells will migrate to the spleen and lymph nodes where they will remain until they are called on during an infection. B cells are involved in the humoral immune response, which targets pathogens loose in blood and lymph, and T cells are involved in the cell-mediated immune response, which targets infected cells.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-344" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4715 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_03_01-300x277-1.jpg" alt="Scan of an electron micorgraph showing a T lymphocyte" width="300" height="277" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_03_01-300x277-1.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_03_01-300x277-1-65x60.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_03_01-300x277-1-225x208.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-344">Figure 12.12: This scanning electron micrograph shows a T lymphocyte.

Not every molecule is antigenic. B cells participate in a chemical response to antigens present in the body by producing specific antibodies that circulate throughout the body and bind with the antigen whenever it is encountered. This is known as the humoral immune response. As discussed, during maturation of B cells, a set of highly specific B cells are produced that have many antigen receptor molecules in their membrane (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_03_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#fig-ch17_03_02">Figure 12.13</a>).</p> <div class="spanall" id="fig-ch17_03_02"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-345" style="width: 246px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4716 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_03_02-246x300-1.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a Y-shaped B cell receptor that projects up from the plasma membrane.

B cell receptors are embedded in the membranes of B cells and bind a variety of antigens through their variable regions.</div></div> </div> <p id="fs-idm2279056">Each B cell has only one kind of antigen receptor, which makes every B cell different. Once the B cells mature in the bone marrow, they migrate to lymph nodes or other lymphatic organs. When a B cell encounters the antigen that binds to its receptor, the antigen molecule is brought into the cell by endocytosis and reappears on the surface of the cell bound to an MHC class II molecule. When this process is complete, the B cell is sensitized. In most cases, the sensitized B cell must then encounter a specific kind of T cell, called a helper T cell, before it is activated. The helper T cell must already have been activated through an encounter with the antigen (discussed below).</p> <p id="fs-idp91423520">The helper T cell binds to the antigen-MHC class II complex and is induced to release cytokines that induce the B cell to divide rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) cells. These daughter cells become either plasma cells or memory B cells. The memory B cells remain inactive at this point, until another later encounter with the antigen, caused by a reinfection by the same bacteria or virus, results in them dividing into a new population of plasma cells. The plasma cells, on the other hand, produce and secrete large quantities, up to 100 million molecules per hour, of antibody molecules. An antibody, also known as an immunoglobulin (Ig), is a protein that is produced by plasma cells after stimulation by an antigen. Antibodies are the agents of humoral immunity. Antibodies occur in the blood, in gastric and mucus secretions, and in breast milk. Antibodies in these bodily fluids can bind pathogens and mark them for destruction by phagocytes before they can infect cells.</p> <p id="fs-idm10370192">These antibodies circulate in the blood stream and lymphatic system and bind with the antigen whenever it is encountered. The binding can fight infection in several ways. Antibodies can bind to viruses or bacteria and interfere with the chemical interactions required for them to infect or bind to other cells. The antibodies may create bridges between different particles containing antigenic sites clumping them all together and preventing their proper functioning. The antigen-antibody complex stimulates the complement system described previously, destroying the cell bearing the antigen. Phagocytic cells, such as those already described, are attracted by the antigen-antibody complexes, and phagocytosis is enhanced when the complexes are present. Finally, antibodies stimulate inflammation, and their presence in mucus and on the skin prevents pathogen attack.</p> <p id="fs-idm9347952">Antibodies coat extracellular pathogens and neutralize them by blocking key sites on the pathogen that enhance their infectivity (such as receptors that “dock” pathogens on host cells) (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_03_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#fig-ch17_03_03">Figure 12.14</a>). Antibody neutralization can prevent pathogens from entering and infecting host cells. The neutralized antibody-coated pathogens can then be filtered by the spleen and eliminated in urine or feces.</p> <p id="fs-idp292064">Antibodies also mark pathogens for destruction by phagocytic cells, such as macrophages or neutrophils, in a process called opsonization. In a process called complement fixation, some antibodies provide a place for complement proteins to bind. The combination of antibodies and complement promotes rapid clearing of pathogens.</p> <p id="fs-idp66357232">The production of antibodies by plasma cells in response to an antigen is called active immunity and describes the host’s active response of the immune system to an infection or to a vaccination. There is also a passive immune response where antibodies come from an outside source, instead of the individual’s own plasma cells, and are introduced into the host. For example, antibodies circulating in a pregnant woman’s body move across the placenta into the developing fetus. The child benefits from the presence of these antibodies for up to several months after birth. In addition, a passive immune response is possible by injecting antibodies into an individual in the form of an antivenom to a snake-bite toxin or antibodies in blood serum to help fight a hepatitis infection. This gives immediate protection since the body does not need the time required to mount its own response.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch17_03_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_346" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-346" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4717 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_03_03.jpg" alt="Part A shows antibody neutralization.

Instead, dendritic cells and macrophages first engulf and digest pathogens into hundreds or thousands of antigens. Then, an antigen-presenting cell (APC) detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will engulf and break it down through phagocytosis. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. A dendritic cell is an immune cell that mops up antigenic materials in its surroundings and presents them on its surface. Dendritic cells are located in the skin, the linings of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. These positions are ideal locations to encounter invading pathogens. Once they are activated by pathogens and mature to become APCs they migrate to the spleen or a lymph node. Macrophages also function as APCs. After phagocytosis by a macrophage, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome. Within the resulting phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_03_04" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#fig-ch17_03_04">Figure 12.15</a>). Helper T cells cannot properly respond to an antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC class II molecule. The APCs express MHC class II on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal an invader.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_347" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-347" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4718 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_03_04.jpg" alt="Illustration shows a bacterium being engulfed by a macrophage.

Some respond to APCs of the innate immune system and indirectly induce immune responses by releasing cytokines. Others stimulate B cells to start the humoral response as described previously. Another type of T cell detects APC signals and directly kills the infected cells, while some are involved in suppressing inappropriate immune reactions to harmless or “self” antigens.</p> <p id="fs-idp61258768">There are two main types of T cells: helper T lymphocytes (T<sub>H</sub>) and the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (T<sub>C</sub>). The T<sub>H</sub> lymphocytes function indirectly to tell other immune cells about potential pathogens. T<sub>H </sub>lymphocytes recognize specific antigens presented by the MHC class II complexes of APCs. There are two populations of T<sub>H</sub> cells: T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to secrete antibodies. Whether a T<sub>H</sub>1 or a T<sub>H</sub>2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.</p> <p id="fs-idp18359264">Cytotoxic T cells (T<sub>C</sub>) are the key component of the cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system and attack and destroy infected cells. T<sub>C</sub> cells are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies. Once activated, the T<sub>C</sub> creates a large clone of cells with one specific set of cell-surface receptors, as in the case with proliferation of activated B cells. As with B cells, the clone includes active T<sub>C</sub> cells and inactive memory T<sub>C</sub> cells. The resulting active T<sub>C</sub> cells then identify infected host cells. Because of the time required to generate a population of clonal T and B cells, there is a delay in the adaptive immune response compared to the innate immune response.</p> <p id="fs-idp77765968">T<sub>C</sub> cells attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. T<sub>C</sub> cells also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers. Cytokines secreted by the T<sub>H</sub>1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate T<sub>C</sub> cells and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors.

As B and T cells mature into effector cells, a subset of the naïve populations differentiates into B and T memory cells with the same antigen specificities (<a id="fig-ch17_03_06" href="#fig-ch17_03_06" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#fig-ch17_03_06">Figure 12.17</a>). A memory cell is an antigen-specific B or T lymphocyte that does not differentiate into an effector cell during the primary immune response, but that can immediately become an effector cell on reexposure to the same pathogen.

Why do you think hemolytic disease is only a problem during the second or subsequent pregnancies?</p> <p>&lt;!– If the blood of the mother and fetus mixes, memory cells that recognize the Rh antigen of the fetus can form in the mother late in the first pregnancy.

This is known as the secondary immune response. One reason why the adaptive immune response is delayed is because it takes time for naïve B and T cells with the appropriate antigen specificities to be identified, activated, and proliferate. On reinfection, this step is skipped, and the result is a more rapid production of immune defenses. Memory B cells that differentiate into plasma cells output tens to hundreds-fold greater antibody amounts than were secreted during the primary response (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_351" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-3-adaptive-immunity/#attachment_351">Figure 12.18</a>).

The blood circulates immune cells, proteins, and other factors through the body. Approximately 0.1 percent of all cells in the blood are leukocytes, which include monocytes (the precursor of macrophages) and lymphocytes. Most cells in the blood are red blood cells.

Mucosa associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is a crucial component of a functional immune system because mucosal surfaces, such as the nasal passages, are the first tissues onto which inhaled or ingested pathogens are deposited. The mucosal tissue includes the mouth, pharynx, and esophagus, and the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urogenital tracts.</p> <p id="fs-idp21153776">Mucosal immunity is formed by MALT, which functions independently of the systemic immune system, and which has its own innate and adaptive components. MALT is a collection of lymphatic tissue that combines with epithelial tissue lining the mucosa throughout the body. This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having minor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine. Activated T cells then migrate through the lymphatic system and into the circulatory system to mucosal sites of infection.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp13811488"><h1>Immune Tolerance</h1> <p id="fs-idp13603824">The immune system has to be regulated to prevent wasteful, unnecessary responses to harmless substances, and more importantly, so that it does not attack “self.” The acquired ability to prevent an unnecessary or harmful immune response to a detected foreign substance known not to cause disease, or self-antigens, is described as immune tolerance. The primary mechanism for developing immune tolerance to self-antigens occurs during the selection for weakly self-binding cells during T and B lymphocyte maturation. There are populations of T cells that suppress the immune response to self-antigens and that suppress the immune response after the infection has cleared to minimize host cell damage induced by inflammation and cell lysis. Immune tolerance is especially well developed in the mucosa of the upper digestive system because of the tremendous number of foreign substances (such as food proteins) that APCs of the oral cavity, pharynx, and gastrointestinal mucosa encounter. Immune tolerance is brought about by specialized APCs in the liver, lymph nodes, small intestine, and lung that present harmless antigens to a diverse population of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, specialized lymphocytes that suppress local inflammation and inhibit the secretion of stimulatory immune factors. The combined result of T<sub>reg</sub> cells is to prevent immunologic activation and inflammation in undesired tissue compartments and to allow the immune system to focus on pathogens instead.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idm39444704"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp11407408">The adaptive immune response is a slower-acting, longer-lasting, and more specific response than the innate response. However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. APCs display antigens on MHC molecules to naïve T cells. T cells with cell-surface receptors that bind a specific antigen will bind to that APC. In response, the T cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming T<sub>H</sub> cells or T<sub>C</sub> cells. T<sub>H</sub> cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas T<sub>C</sub> cells destroy infected or cancerous cells. Memory cells are produced by activated and proliferating B and T cells and persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector cells without input from the innate immune system. The mucosal immune system is largely independent of the systemic immune system but functions in parallel to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body. Immune tolerance is brought about by T<sub>reg</sub> cells to limit reactions to harmless antigens and the body’s own molecules.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><h3 class="textbox__title"><em>Exercises</em></h3> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive H5P element has been excluded from this version of the text.

In the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time, large population sizes and often higher mutation rates. Thus pathogens have evolved a diverse array of immune escape mechanisms. For instance, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>(the bacterium that causes pneumonia and meningitis) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (the bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system. HIV infects T<sub>H</sub> cells using their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of T<sub>H</sub> cells in the body (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_04_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-4-disruptions-in-the-immune-system/#fig-ch17_04_01">Figure 12.21</a>); this inhibits the adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch17_04_01"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_355" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-355" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_04_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_04_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4727 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01.jpg" alt="A colored scanning electron micrograph of a lymphocyte with cytoplasmic extensions, and many small spheres coming out of the lymphocyte and scattered around it." width="544" height="361" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01-300x199.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01-225x149.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_17_04_01-350x232.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-355">Figure 12.21 HIV (green) is shown budding from a lymphocyte cell (red) in culture.

Immunodeficiency can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels so that the immune system becomes overwhelmed. Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens that attack the cells of the immune system itself (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical treatments such as chemotherapy), malnutrition, or extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may also occur. For example, severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) is a condition in which children are born without functioning B or T cells.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp46804448"><h1>Hypersensitivities</h1> <p id="fs-idp60739328">A maladaptive immune response toward harmless foreign substances or self-antigens that occur after tissue sensitization is termed a hypersensitivity. Types of hypersensitivities include immediate, delayed, and autoimmune. A large proportion of the human population is affected by one or more types of hypersensitivity.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp116231984"><h2>Allergies</h2> <p id="fs-idp114276480">The immune reaction that results from immediate hypersensitivities in which an antibody-mediated immune response occurs within minutes of exposure to a usually harmless antigen is called an allergy. In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. On initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies through the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T<sub>H</sub> cells that stimulate B cells to produce the antibodies. The antibody molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. On subsequent exposure to the same allergen, antibody molecules on mast cells bind the antigen and stimulate the mast cell to release histamine and other inflammatory chemicals; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils (a type of white blood cell), which also appear to be adapted to responding to parasitic worms (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch17_04_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/12-4-disruptions-in-the-immune-system/#fig-ch17_04_02">Figure 12.22</a>). Eosinophils release factors that enhance the inflammatory response and the secretions of mast cells. The effects of an allergic reaction range from mild symptoms like sneezing and itchy, watery eyes to more severe or even life-threatening reactions involving intensely itchy welts or hives, airway constriction with severe respiratory distress, and plummeting blood pressure caused by dilating blood vessels and fluid loss from the circulatory system. This extreme reaction, typically in response to an allergen introduced to the circulatory system, is known as anaphylactic shock. Antihistamines are an insufficient counter to anaphylactic shock and if not treated with epinephrine to counter the blood pressure and breathing effects, this condition can be fatal.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch17_04_02"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_356" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-356" style="width: 342px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_04_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_17_04_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4728" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_17_04_02.jpg" alt="Illustration shows ragweed pollen attached to the surface of a B cell.

Delayed hypersensitivity occurs in some individuals in response to contact with certain types of jewelry or cosmetics.

Antibodies and T-cell receptors may bind self-antigens that are structurally similar to pathogen antigens. As an example, infection with <em>Streptococcus pyogenes </em>(the bacterium that causes strep throat) may generate antibodies or T cells that react with heart muscle, which has a similar structure to the surface of <em>S. pyogenes</em>. These antibodies can damage heart muscle with autoimmune attacks, leading to rheumatic fever. Insulin-dependent (Type 1) diabetes mellitus arises from a destructive inflammatory T<sub>H</sub>1 response against insulin-producing cells of the pancreas. Patients with this autoimmunity must be treated with regular insulin injections.</p> </div> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idp53290080"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp35817920">Immune disruptions may involve insufficient immune responses or inappropriate immune responses.

Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical offspring (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents. During sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female’s body for internal fertilization, the sperm may be left in the environment for the female to pick up and place in her body, or both sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses provide an example of the latter, but with a twist (Figure 13.1). Following a mating dance, the female releases eggs into the male seahorse’s abdominal brood pouch and the male releases sperm into the water, which then find their way into the brood pouch to fertilize the eggs. The fertilized eggs develop in the pouch for several weeks.</p><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Asexual reproduction produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly; these are two advantages that asexually reproducing organisms have over sexually reproducing organisms. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment, species that reproduce asexually may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not be adapted to different conditions.</p> <p id="fs-idp16470176">During sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give sexually reproducing individuals greater fitness because more of their offspring may survive and reproduce in an unpredictable or changing environment. Species that reproduce sexually (and have separate sexes) must maintain two different types of individuals, males and females. Only half the population (females) can produce the offspring, so fewer offspring will be produced when compared to asexual reproduction. This is a disadvantage of sexual reproduction compared to asexual reproduction.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp49553760"><h1>Asexual Reproduction</h1> <p id="fs-idp40977728">Asexual reproduction occurs in prokaryotic microorganisms (bacteria and archaea) and in many eukaryotic, single-celled and multi-celled organisms.

It is in some ways analogous to the process of binary fission of single-celled prokaryotic organisms. The term fission is applied to instances in which an organism appears to split itself into two parts and, if necessary, regenerate the missing parts of each new organism. For example, species of turbellarian flatworms commonly called the planarians, such as <em>Dugesia dorotocephala</em>, are able to separate their bodies into head and tail regions and then regenerate the missing half in each of the two new organisms. Sea anemones (Cnidaria), such as species of the genus <em>Anthopleura</em> (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch18_01_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-1-how-animals-reproduce/#fig-ch18_01_01">Figure 13.2</a>), will divide along the oral-aboral axis, and sea cucumbers (Echinodermata) of the genus <em>Holothuria,</em> will divide into two halves across the oral-aboral axis and regenerate the other half in each of the resulting individuals.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch18_01_01"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_362" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-362" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4736 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01.jpg" alt="Photo shows a larger cream-colored sea anemone right next to another anemone of the same color and shape, but smaller." width="544" height="463" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01-300x255.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01-65x55.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01-225x191.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_18_01_01-350x298.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-362">Figure 13.2&nbsp; The Anthopleura artemisia sea anemone can reproduce through fission.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp98986176"><h2>Budding</h2> <p id="fs-idp162760032">Budding is a form of asexual reproduction that results from the outgrowth of a part of the body leading to a separation of the “bud” from the original organism and the formation of two individuals, one smaller than the other.

If the animal is capable of fragmentation, and the parts are big enough, a separate individual will regrow from each part. Fragmentation may occur through accidental damage, damage from predators, or as a natural form of reproduction. Reproduction through fragmentation is observed in sponges, some cnidarians, turbellarians, echinoderms, and annelids. In some sea stars, a new individual can be regenerated from a broken arm and a piece of the central disc. This sea star (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch18_01_03" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-1-how-animals-reproduce/#fig-ch18_01_03">Figure 13.4</a>) is in the process of growing a complete sea star from an arm that has been cut off. Fisheries workers have been known to try to kill the sea stars eating their clam or oyster beds by cutting them in half and throwing them back into the ocean. Unfortunately for the workers, the two parts can each regenerate a new half, resulting in twice as many sea stars to prey upon the oysters and clams.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch18_01_03"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-365" style="width: 550px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4739" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_01_03-300x128-1.jpg" alt="Part a: The photo shows a brown sea star with five arms of slightly varying lengths.

The resulting offspring can be either haploid or diploid, depending on the process in the species. Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water fleas, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, and ants, wasps, and bees. Ants, bees, and wasps use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (drones). The diploid females (workers and queens) are the result of a fertilized egg.</p> <p id="fs-idp38570160">Some vertebrate animals—such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish—also reproduce through parthenogenesis. Parthenogenesis has been observed in species in which the sexes were separated in terrestrial or marine zoos. Two female Komodo dragons, a hammerhead shark, and a blacktop shark have produced parthenogenic young when the females have been isolated from males. It is possible that the asexual reproduction observed occurred in response to unusual circumstances and would normally not occur.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp86438640"><h1>Sexual Reproduction</h1> <p id="fs-idp8936480">Sexual reproduction is the combination of reproductive cells from two individuals to form genetically unique offspring. The nature of the individuals that produce the two kinds of gametes can vary, having for example separate sexes or both sexes in each individual. Sex determination, the mechanism that determines which sex an individual develops into, also can vary.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm46757344"><h2>Hermaphroditism</h2> <p id="fs-idm30472368">Hermaphroditism occurs in animals in which one individual has both male and female reproductive systems. Invertebrates such as earthworms, slugs, tapeworms, and snails (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#fig-ch18_01_04" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-1-how-animals-reproduce/#fig-ch18_01_04">Figure 13.5</a>) are often hermaphroditic. Hermaphrodites may self-fertilize, but typically they will mate with another of their species, fertilizing each other and both producing offspring. Self-fertilization is more common in animals that have limited mobility or are not motile, such as barnacles and clams. Many species have specific mechanisms in place to prevent self-fertilization, because it is an extreme form of inbreeding and usually produces less fit offspring.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch18_01_04"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_366" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-366" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_04ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_01_04ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4740" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_01_04ab-300x138-1.jpg" alt="Part a: The photo shows a land snail.

Individuals homozygous for X (XX) are female and heterozygous individuals (XY) are male. In mammals, the presence of a Y chromosome causes the development of male characteristics and its absence results in female characteristics. The XY system is also found in some insects and plants.</p> <p id="fs-idm8256944">Bird sex determination is dependent on the combination of Z and W chromosomes. Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. Notice that this system is the opposite of the mammalian system because in birds the female is the sex with the different sex chromosomes. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use the ZW system.</p> <p id="fs-idm60998720">More complicated chromosomal sex determining systems also exist. For example, some swordtail fish have three sex chromosomes in a population.</p> <p id="fs-idm52222464">The sex of some other species is not determined by chromosomes, but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in alligators, some turtles, and tuataras, for example, is dependent on the temperature during the middle third of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically, as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females, while in many other species of turtles, the reverse is true. In some crocodiles and some turtles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females.</p> <p id="fs-idp38059728">Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, switching from one to the other. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, it is termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters are born male, grow in size, and become female and lay eggs. The wrasses, a family of reef fishes, are all sequential hermaphrodites. Some of these species live in closely coordinated schools with a dominant male and a large number of smaller females. If the male dies, a female increases in size, changes sex, and becomes the new dominant male.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm809728"><h1>Fertilization</h1> <p id="fs-idm26462112">The fusion of a sperm and an egg is a process called fertilization. This can occur either inside (internal fertilization) or outside (external fertilization) the body of the female. Humans provide an example of the former, whereas frog reproduction is an example of the latter.</p> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp29623744"><h1>External Fertilization</h1> <p id="fs-idp47937104">External fertilization usually occurs in aquatic environments where both eggs and sperm are released into the water. After the sperm reaches the egg, fertilization takes place. Most external fertilization happens during the process of spawning where one or several females release their eggs and the male(s) release sperm in the same area, at the same time. The spawning may be triggered by environmental signals, such as water temperature or the length of daylight.

Internal fertilization may occur by the male directly depositing sperm in the female during mating. It may also occur by the male depositing sperm in the environment, usually in a protective structure, which a female picks up to deposit the sperm in her reproductive tract. There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In oviparity, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female’s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_368" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-1-how-animals-reproduce/#attachment_368">Figure 13.7 </a><strong>a</strong>). This occurs in some bony fish, some reptiles, a few cartilaginous fish, some amphibians, a few mammals, and all birds. Most non-avian reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and some turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. Chicken eggs are an example of a hard shell. The eggs of the egg-laying mammals such as the platypus and echidna are leathery.</p> <p id="fs-idm5853120">In ovoviparity, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, and the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk. The eggs are retained in the female’s body until they hatch inside of her, or she lays the eggs right before they hatch. This process helps protect the eggs until hatching. This occurs in some bony fish (like the platyfish <em>Xiphophorus maculatus, </em><a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_368" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-1-how-animals-reproduce/#attachment_368">Figure 13.7 </a><strong>b</strong>), some sharks, lizards, some snakes (garter snake <em>Thamnophis sirtalis</em>), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (Madagascar hissing cockroach <em>Gromphadorhina portentosa</em>).</p> <p id="fs-idm61587328">In viviparity the young are born alive.

Asexual reproduction in animals occurs through fission, budding, fragmentation, and parthenogenesis. Sexual reproduction may involve fertilization inside the body or in the external environment. A species may have separate sexes or combined sexes; when the sexes are combined they may be expressed at different times in the life cycle. The sex of an individual may be determined by various chromosomal systems or environmental factors such as temperature.</p> <p id="fs-idm36035312">Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either outside the bodies or inside the female. The method of fertilization varies among animals. Some species release the egg and sperm into the environment, some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the developing offspring throughout the gestation period.</p> </div> <div class="multiple-choice" id="fs-idm5847648"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="multiple-choice"><div id="fs-idm25367184"><div id="fs-idm28337984"><ol><li id="fs-idp18272576">In which group is parthenogenesis a normal event? <ol><li>chickens</li> <li>bees</li> <li>rabbits</li> <li>sea stars</li> </ol> </li> <li>Genetically unique individuals are produced through ________. <ol><li>sexual reproduction</li> <li>parthenogenesis</li> <li>budding</li> <li>fragmentation</li> </ol> </li> <li>External fertilization occurs in which type of environment? <ol><li>aquatic</li> <li>forested</li> <li>savanna</li> <li>steppe</li> </ol> </li> <li>What might be a disadvantage to temperature-dependent sex determination?</li> <li>Compared to separate sexes and assuming self-fertilizing is not possible, what might be one advantage and one disadvantage to hermaphroditism?</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div class="free-response" id="fs-idm36903312"><div id="fs-idp93532768"><div id="fs-idp38671968"></div> </div> <div id="fs-idp21657776"><div id="fs-idp14948736"><p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>A</li> <li>Temperatures can vary from year to year and an unusually cold or hot year might produce offspring all of one sex, making it hard for individuals to find mates.</li> <li>A possible advantage of hermaphroditism might be that anytime an individual of the same species is encountered a mating is possible, unlike separate sexes that must find an individual of the right sex to mate.

To ensure that the offspring has only one complete diploid set of chromosomes, only one sperm must fuse with one egg. In mammals, a layer called the zona pellucida protects the egg. At the tip of the head of a sperm cell is a structure like a lysosome called the acrosome, which contains enzymes. When a sperm binds to the zona pellucida, a series of events, called the acrosomal reactions, take place. These reactions, involving enzymes from the acrosome, allow the sperm plasma membrane to fuse with the egg plasma membrane and permit the sperm nucleus to transfer into the ovum. The nuclear membranes of the egg and sperm break down and the two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus or genome.</p> <div class="" id="fig-ch18_02_01"><div class="bc-figcaption figcaption">&nbsp;</div></div> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-381" style="width: 418px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4745 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_02_01.jpg" alt="Micrograph shows a sperm whose head is touching the surface of an egg.

They involve specialized and different anatomies in the two sexes, a hormone regulation system, and specialized behaviors regulated by the brain and endocrine system.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm3103760"><h1>Human Reproductive Anatomy</h1> <p id="fs-idm21069760">The reproductive tissues of male and female humans develop similarly <em>in utero</em> until about the seventh week of gestation when a low level of the hormone testosterone is released from the gonads of the developing male. Testosterone causes the primitive gonads to differentiate into male sexual organs. When testosterone is absent, the primitive gonads develop into ovaries. Tissues that produce a penis in males produce a clitoris in females. The tissue that will become the scrotum in a male becomes the labia in a female. Thus the male and female anatomies arise from a divergence in the development of what were once common embryonic structures.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp10424528"><h2>Male Reproductive Anatomy</h2> <p id="fs-idm53993712">Sperm are immobile at body temperature; therefore, the testes are external to the body so that a correct temperature is maintained for motility. In land mammals, including humans, the pair of testes must be suspended outside the body so the environment of the sperm is about 2 °C lower than body temperature to produce viable sperm. If the testes do not descend through the abdominal cavity during fetal development, the individual has reduced fertility.</p> <p id="fs-idm133558880">The scrotum houses the testicles or testes (singular: testis), and provides passage for blood vessels, nerves, and muscles related to testicular function. The testes are a pair of male gonads that produce sperm and reproductive hormones. Each testis is approximately 2.5 by 3.8 cm (1.5 by 1 inch) in size and divided into wedge-shaped lobes by septa. Coiled in each wedge are seminiferous tubules that produce sperm.</p> <p id="fs-idm6946000">The penis drains urine from the urinary bladder and is a copulatory organ during intercourse (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_371" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_371">Figure 13.12</a>; <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#tab-ch18_03_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#tab-ch18_03_01">Table 13.1</a>). The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue that become engorged with blood, making the penis erect, in preparation for intercourse. The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During orgasm, the accessory organs and glands connected to the testes contract and empty the semen (containing sperm) into the urethra and the fluid is expelled from the body by muscular contractions causing ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.</p> <p id="fs-idp24483856">Semen is a mixture of sperm (about five percent of the total) and fluids from accessory glands that contribute most of the semen’s volume. Sperm are haploid cells, consisting of a flagellum for motility, a neck that contains the cell’s energy-producing mitochondria, and a head that contains the genetic material (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_370" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_370">Figure 13.11</a>). An acrosome (acrosomal vesicle) is found at the top of the head of the sperm. This structure contains enzymes that can digest the protective coverings that surround the egg and allow the sperm to fuse with the egg. An ejaculate will contain from two to five milliliters of fluid and from 50–120 million sperm per milliliter.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-370" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4751 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01.jpg" alt="Micrograph shows human sperm, which have an oval head about 3 microns across and a very long flagellum." width="544" height="380" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01-300x210.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01-225x157.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_18_03_01-350x244.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-370">Figure 13.11 As seen in this scanning electron micrograph, human sperm has a flagellum, neck, and head.

The walls of the seminiferous tubules are made up of the developing sperm cells, with the least developed sperm at the periphery of the tubule and the fully developed sperm next to the lumen. The sperm cells are associated with Sertoli cells that nourish and promote the development of the sperm. Other cells present between the walls of the tubules are the interstitial cells of Leydig, which produce testosterone once the male reaches adolescence.</p> <p id="fs-idm65056192">When the sperm have developed flagella they leave the seminiferous tubules and enter the epididymis (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_371" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_371">Figure 13.12</a>; <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#tab-ch18_03_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#tab-ch18_03_01">Table 13.1</a>). This structure lies along the top and posterior of the testes and is the site of sperm maturation. The sperm leave the epididymis and enter the vas deferens, which carries the sperm behind the bladder, and forms the ejaculatory duct with the duct from the seminal vesicles. During a vasectomy, a section of the vas deferens is removed, preventing sperm (but not the secretions of the accessory glands) from being passed out of the body during ejaculation and preventing fertilization.</p> <p id="fs-idm61357248">The bulk of the semen comes from the accessory glands associated with the male reproductive system. These are the seminal vesicles, the prostate gland, and the bulbourethral gland (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_371" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_371">Figure 13.12</a>; <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#tab-ch18_03_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#tab-ch18_03_01">Table 13.1</a>). The secretions from the accessory glands provide important compounds for the sperm including nutrients, electrolytes, and pH buffering. There are also coagulation factors that affect sperm delivery and motility.</p> <div id="fs-idm55697776" class="art-connection"><div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-371" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4752" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_03_02.png" alt="Illustration shows a cross section of the penis and testes.

Seminiferous tubules are located in the testes. The epididymis partly surrounds the sac containing the seminiferous tubules. The Vas deferens is a tube connecting the seminiferous tubules to the ejaculatory duct, which begins in the prostate gland. The prostate gland is located behind and below the bladder.

Each gland consists of 15 to 25 lobes that have ducts that empty at the nipple and that supply the nursing child with nutrient- and antibody-rich milk to aid development and protect the child.</p> <p id="fs-idp33512560">Internal female reproductive structures include ovaries, oviducts, the uterus, and the vagina (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_372" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_372">Figure 13.13</a>; <a class="autogenerated-content" href="#tab-ch18_03_02" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#tab-ch18_03_02">Table 13.2</a>). The pair of ovaries is held in place in the abdominal cavity by a system of ligaments. The outermost layer of the ovary is made up of follicles, each consisting of one or more follicular cells that surround, nourish, and protect a single egg. During the menstrual period, a batch of follicular cells develops and prepares their eggs for release. At ovulation, one follicle ruptures and one egg is released. Following ovulation, the follicular tissue that surrounded the ovulated egg stays within the ovary and grows to form a solid mass called the corpus luteum. The corpus luteum secretes additional estrogen and the hormone progesterone that helps maintain the uterine lining during pregnancy. The ovaries also produce hormones, such as estrogen.</p> <p id="fs-idp15016944">The oviducts, or fallopian tubes, extend from the uterus in the lower abdominal cavity to the ovaries, but they are not in contact with the ovaries. The lateral ends of the oviducts flare out into a trumpet-like structure and have a fringe of finger-like projections called fimbrae. When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the nonmotile egg enter into the tube. The walls of the oviducts have a ciliated epithelium over smooth muscle. The cilia beat, and the smooth muscle contracts, moving the egg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviduct and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct.</p> <p id="fs-idp60629680">Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed, preventing sperm from reaching the egg.</p> <p id="fs-idp16418720">The uterus is a structure about the size of a woman’s fist. The uterus has a thick muscular wall and is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands that develop and thicken during the female cycle. Thickening of the endometrium prepares the uterus to receive the fertilized egg or zygote, which will then implant itself in the endometrium. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in forcing the baby through the vagina during labor. If fertilization does not occur, a portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period. The endometrium builds up again in preparation for implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina.</p> <p id="fs-idp27142832">The vagina is a muscular tube that serves several purposes. It allows menstrual flow to leave the body. It is the receptacle for the penis during intercourse and the pathway for the delivery of offspring.</p> <table id="tab-ch18_03_02" summary="Female Reproductive Anatomy"><caption>Table 13.2 Female Reproductive Anatomy</caption> <thead><tr><th>Organ</th> <th>Location</th> <th>Function</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td>Clitoris</td> <td>External</td> <td>Sensory organ</td> </tr> <tr><td>Mons pubis</td> <td>External</td> <td>Fatty area overlying pubic bone</td> </tr> <tr><td>Labia majora</td> <td>External</td> <td>Covers labia minora; contains sweat and sebaceous glands</td> </tr> <tr><td>Labia minora</td> <td>External</td> <td>Covers vestibule</td> </tr> <tr><td>Greater vestibular glands</td> <td>External</td> <td>Secrete mucus; lubricate vagina</td> </tr> <tr><td>Breast</td> <td>External</td> <td>Produces and delivers milk</td> </tr> <tr><td>Ovaries</td> <td>Internal</td> <td>Produce and develop eggs</td> </tr> <tr><td>Oviducts</td> <td>Internal</td> <td>Transport egg to uterus; site of fertilization</td> </tr> <tr><td>Uterus</td> <td>Internal</td> <td>Supports developing embryo</td> </tr> <tr><td>Vagina</td> <td>Internal</td> <td>Common tube for intercourse, birth canal, passing menstrual flow</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm51581344"><h1>Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)</h1> <p id="fs-idm61111184">Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, involves the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two nuclear divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell’s life cycle. Meiosis and its associated cell divisions produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells. The production of sperm is called spermatogenesis and the production of eggs is called oogenesis.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp106424016"><h2>Spermatogenesis</h2> <p id="fs-idp51327056">Spermatogenesis occurs in the wall of the seminiferous tubules, with the most primitive cells at the periphery of the tube and the most mature sperm at the lumen of the tube (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_373" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_373">Figure 13.14</a>). Immediately under the capsule of the tubule are diploid, undifferentiated cells. These stem cells, each called a spermatogonium (pl. spermatogonia), go through mitosis to produce one cell that remains as a stem cell and a second cell called a primary spermatocyte that will undergo meiosis to produce sperm.</p> <p id="fs-idm8365664">The diploid primary spermatocyte goes through meiosis I to produce two haploid cells called secondary spermatocytes. Each secondary spermatocyte divides after meiosis II to produce two cells called spermatids. The spermatids eventually reach the lumen of the tubule and grow a flagellum, becoming sperm cells.

However, the meiotic division is arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in prophase I. This situation is in contrast with the male reproductive system in which sperm are produced continuously throughout the life of the individual. Starting at adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a few follicles in an ovary each month. This results in a primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cytoplasm and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. Cell division is again arrested, this time at metaphase II. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte is released and travels toward the uterus through the oviduct. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through meiosis II, producing a second polar body and haploid egg, which fuses with the haploid sperm to form a fertilized egg (zygote) containing all 46 chromosomes.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp5517808"><h1>Hormonal Control of Reproduction</h1> <p id="fs-idm7242272">The human male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by the interaction of hormones from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary with hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. In both sexes, the hypothalamus monitors and causes the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary gland. When the reproductive hormone is required, the hypothalamus sends a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) to the anterior pituitary. This causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary into the blood. Although these hormones are named after their functions in female reproduction, they are produced in both sexes and play important roles in controlling reproduction. Other hormones have specific functions in the male and female reproductive systems.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idm80533424"><h2>Male Hormones</h2> <p id="fs-idp25763856">At the onset of puberty, the hypothalamus causes the release of FSH and LH into the male system for the first time. FSH enters the testes and stimulates the Sertoli cells located in the walls of the seminiferous tubules to begin promoting spermatogenesis (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_376" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_376">Figure 13.16</a>). LH also enters the testes and stimulates the interstitial cells of Leydig, located in between the walls of the seminiferous tubules, to make and release testosterone into the testes and the blood.</p> <p id="fs-idm3018512">Testosterone stimulates spermatogenesis. This hormone is also responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics that develop in the male during adolescence. The secondary sex characteristics in males include a deepening of the voice, the growth of facial, axillary, and pubic hair, an increase in muscle bulk, and the beginnings of the sex drive.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-376" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_06.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_06.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4757" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_03_06-1024x437-1.jpg" alt="Hormonal control of the male reproductive system is mediated by the hypothalamus, anterior pituitary and testes.

In addition, the Sertoli cells produce the hormone inhibin, which is released into the blood when the sperm count is too high. This inhibits the release of GnRH and FSH, which will cause spermatogenesis to slow down. If the sperm count reaches a low of 20 million/mL, the Sertoli cells cease the release of inhibin, and the sperm count increases.</p> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp2908816"><h1>Female Hormones</h1> <p id="fs-idm24477232">The control of reproduction in females is more complex. The female reproductive cycle is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. The ovarian cycle governs the preparation of endocrine tissues and release of eggs, while the menstrual cycle governs the preparation and maintenance of the uterine lining (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_377" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_377">Figure 13.17</a>). These cycles are coordinated over a 22–32 day cycle, with an average length of 28 days.</p> <p id="fs-idm78493232">As with the male, the GnRH from the hypothalamus causes the release of the hormones FSH and LH from the anterior pituitary. In addition, estrogen and progesterone are released from the developing follicles. As with testosterone in males, estrogen is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of females. These include breast development, flaring of the hips, and a shorter period for bone growth.</p> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp26442928"><h2>The Ovarian Cycle and the Menstrual Cycle</h2> <p id="fs-idm81803136">The ovarian and menstrual cycles are regulated by hormones of the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_377" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_377">Figure 13.17</a>). The ebb and flow of the hormones causes the ovarian and menstrual cycles to advance. The ovarian and menstrual cycles occur concurrently. The first half of the ovarian cycle is the follicular phase. Slowly rising levels of FSH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogen. The first few days of this cycle coincide with menstruation or the sloughing off of the functional layer of the endometrium in the uterus. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.</p> <div id="fs-idm40938256" class="art-connection"><div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_377" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-377" style="width: 566px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_07.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_07.png"><img class="wp-image-4758" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_03_07-966x1024-1.png" alt="Hormone levels during the follicular phase, ovulation, and the luteal phase are compared. During the follicular phase, LH and FSH secreted from the pituitary stimulate several follicles to grow. The follicles produce low levels of estrogen that inhibit GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus, keeping LH and FSH levels low. Low levels of estrogen also cause the endometrial arteries to constrict, resulting in menstruation. During the time leading up to ovulation, LH and FSH stimulate maturation of one of the follicles. The growing follicle begins to produce high levels of estrogen, which stimulates GnRH secretion by the hypothalamus. As a result, LH and FSH levels rise, resulting in ovulation about a day later. Estrogen also causes the endometrium to thicken. After ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters the luteal phase. LH from the pituitary stimulates growth of the corpus luteum from the ruptured follicle. The corpus luteum secretes estrogen and progesterone that block GnRH production by the hypothalamus and LH and FSH production by the pituitary.

Estradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the endometrium to thicken.</p> <p>C. Both progesterone and estrogen are produced by the follicles.</p> <p>D.

The spike in LH causes the most mature follicle to rupture and release its egg. This is ovulation. The follicles that did not rupture degenerate and their eggs are lost. The level of estrogen decreases when the extra follicles degenerate.</p> <p id="fs-idm80773552">Following ovulation, the ovarian cycle enters its luteal phase and the menstrual cycle enters its secretory phase, both of which run from about day 15 to 28. The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.</p> <p id="fs-idm79258800">If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again.</p> <div id="fs-idm13918768" class="career non-majors"><h2 id="fs-idm16936528">Reproductive Endocrinologist</h2> <p>A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to reproduction and infertility in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as <em>in vitro</em> fertilization.</p> <p id="fs-idp3473808">Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="bc-section section" id="fs-idp10496064"><h1>Gestation</h1> <p id="fs-idp91814176">Pregnancy begins with the fertilization of an egg and continues through to the birth of the individual. The length of time of gestation, or the gestation period, in humans is 266 days and is similar in other great apes.</p> <p id="fs-idm28904240">Within 24 hours of fertilization, the egg nucleus has finished meiosis and the egg and sperm nuclei fuse. With fusion, the cell is known as a zygote. The zygote initiates cleavage and the developing embryo travels through the oviduct to the uterus. The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the developing embryo or blastocyst grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue. Another layer of the blastocyst, the chorion, begins releasing a hormone called human beta chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG), which makes its way to the corpus luteum and keeps that structure active. This ensures adequate levels of progesterone that will maintain the endometrium of the uterus for the support of the developing embryo. Pregnancy tests determine the level of β-HCG in urine or serum. If the hormone is present, the test is positive.</p> <p id="fs-idm80666208">The gestation period is divided into three equal periods or trimesters. During the first two-to-four weeks of the first trimester, nutrition and waste are handled by the endometrial lining through diffusion. As the trimester progresses, the outer layer of the embryo begins to merge with the endometrium, and the placenta forms. The placenta takes over the nutrient and waste requirements of the embryo and fetus, with the mother’s blood passing nutrients to the placenta and removing waste from it. Chemicals from the fetus, such as bilirubin, are processed by the mother’s liver for elimination. Some of the mother’s immunoglobulins will pass through the placenta, providing passive immunity against some potential infections.</p> <p id="fs-idm59950016">Internal organs and body structures begin to develop during the first trimester. By five weeks, limb buds, eyes, the heart, and liver have been basically formed. By eight weeks, the term fetus applies, and the body is essentially formed (<a class="autogenerated-content" href="#attachment_378" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/13-3-human-reproduction/#attachment_378">Figure 13.18</a>&nbsp;<strong>a</strong>). The individual is about five centimeters (two inches) in length and many of the organs, such as the lungs and liver, are not yet functioning. Exposure to any toxins is especially dangerous during the first trimester, as all of the body’s organs and structures are going through initial development. Anything that interferes with chemical signaling during that development can have a severe effect on the fetus’ survival.</p> <div class=""><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_378" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-378" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_08abc.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/02/Figure_18_03_08abc.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4759" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_18_03_08abc-1024x456-1.jpg" alt="Part a: Photo shows a human fetus, with a large bent head and a dark eye, fingers on its arm and a leg bud.

Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. Oxytocin causes smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.</p> <p id="fs-idm76925584">There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.</p> </div> <div class="summary" id="fs-idp25260000"><h1>Section Summary</h1> <p id="fs-idp26159504">The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring.

The hypothalamus monitors the need for FSH and LH production and release from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive cycle, which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle.</p> <p id="fs-idm99357312">Human pregnancy begins with fertilization of an egg and proceeds through the three trimesters of gestation. The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems.

This is a diploid, fertilized egg.</li> <li>Low levels of progesterone allow the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary and cause the release of FSH and LH. FSH stimulates follicles on the ovary to grow and prepare the eggs for ovulation. As the follicles increase in size, they begin to release estrogen and a low level of progesterone into the blood. The level of estrogen rises to a peak, causing a spike in the concentration of LH. This causes the most mature follicle to rupture and ovulation occurs.</li> <li>Stage one of labor results in uterine contractions, which thin the cervix and dilate the cervical opening. Stage two delivers the baby, and stage three delivers the placenta.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <div id="fs-idm12516544"><p><strong>bulbourethral gland: </strong>the paired glands in the human male that produce a secretion that cleanses the urethra prior to ejaculation</p> </div> <div id="fs-idp12143392"><p><strong>corpus luteum: </strong>the endocrine tissue that develops from an ovarian follicle after ovulation;

This plan is found mostly in aquatic animals, especially organisms that attach themselves to a base, like a rock or a boat, and extract their food from the surrounding water as it flows around the organism. Bilateral symmetry is illustrated in the same figure by a goat. The goat also has an upper and lower component to it, but a plane cut from front to back separates the animal into definite right and left sides. Additional terms used when describing positions in the body are anterior (front), posterior (rear), dorsal (toward the back), and ventral (toward the stomach). Bilateral symmetry is found in both land-based and aquatic animals; it enables a high level of mobility.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44730-fs-idm102628256" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Limiting Effects of Diffusion on Size and Development</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idp5864112"></span>The exchange of nutrients and wastes between a cell and its watery environment occurs through the process of diffusion. All living cells are bathed in liquid, whether they are in a single-celled organism or a multicellular one. Diffusion is effective over a specific distance and limits the size that an individual cell can attain. If a cell is a single-celled microorganism, such as an amoeba, it can satisfy all of its nutrient and waste needs through diffusion. If the cell is too large, then diffusion is ineffective and the center of the cell does not receive adequate nutrients nor is it able to effectively dispel its waste.</p> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idm81449888"></span>An important concept in understanding how efficient diffusion is as a means of transport is the surface to volume ratio. Recall that any three-dimensional object has a surface area and volume; the ratio of these two quantities is the surface-to-volume ratio. Consider a cell shaped like a perfect sphere: it has a surface area of 4πr<sup>2</sup>, and a volume of (4/3)πr<sup>3</sup>. The surface-to-volume ratio of a sphere is 3/r; as the cell gets bigger, its surface to volume ratio decreases, making diffusion less efficient. The larger the size of the sphere, or animal, the less surface area for diffusion it possesses.</p> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idp18501248"></span>The solution to producing larger organisms is for them to become multicellular. Specialization occurs in complex organisms, allowing cells to become more efficient at doing fewer tasks. For example, circulatory systems bring nutrients and remove waste, while respiratory systems provide oxygen for the cells and remove carbon dioxide from them. Other organ systems have developed further specialization of cells and tissues and efficiently control body functions. Moreover, surface-to-volume ratio applies to other areas of animal development, such as the relationship between muscle mass and cross-sectional surface area in supporting skeletons, and in the relationship between muscle mass and the generation of dissipation of heat.</p> <div id="m44730-fs-idm36204976" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44730-fs-idm152353712"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/nanoscopy.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idp109090224"></span>Visit <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nanoscopy" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nanoscopy">this interactive site</a> to see an entire animal (a zebrafish embryo) at the cellular and sub-cellular level.

These nutrients are converted to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for short-term storage and use by all cells. Some animals store energy for slightly longer times as glycogen, and others store energy for much longer times in the form of triglycerides housed in specialized adipose tissues. No energy system is one hundred percent efficient, and an animal’s metabolism produces waste energy in the form of heat. If an animal can conserve that heat and maintain a relatively constant body temperature, it is classified as a warm-blooded animal and called an <strong><span id="m44730-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1465730"></span>endotherm</strong>. The insulation used to conserve the body heat comes in the forms of fur, fat, or feathers. The absence of insulation in <strong>ectothermic</strong> animals increases their dependence on the environment for body heat.</p> <p>The amount of energy expended by an animal over a specific time is called its metabolic rate. The rate is measured variously in joules, calories, or kilocalories (1000 calories). Carbohydrates and proteins contain about 4.5 to 5 kcal/g, and fat contains about 9 kcal/g. Metabolic rate is estimated as the <strong>basal metabolic rate (BMR)</strong> in endothermic animals at rest and as the <span id="m44730-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657120"></span><strong>standard metabolic rate (SMR)</strong> in ectotherms. Human males have a BMR of 1600 to 1800 kcal/day, and human females have a BMR of 1300 to 1500 kcal/day. Even with insulation, endothermal animals require extensive amounts of energy to maintain a constant body temperature. An ectotherm such as an alligator has an SMR of 60 kcal/day.</p> <div class="section" title="Energy Requirements Related to Body Size"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44730-fs-idm78821056" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Energy Requirements Related to Body Size</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idm69258720"></span>Smaller endothermic animals have a greater surface area for their mass than larger ones (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1096" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/14-1-animal-form-and-function/#attachment_1096">Figure 14.4</a>). Therefore, smaller animals lose heat at a faster rate than larger animals and require more energy to maintain a constant internal temperature. This results in a smaller endothermic animal having a higher BMR, per body weight, than a larger endothermic animal.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1096" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1096" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4768" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure_33_01_03" width="600" height="220" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03.jpg 1117w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-300x110.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-1024x375.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-768x281.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-65x24.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-225x82.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_01_03-350x128.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1096">Figure 14.4.&nbsp; The mouse has a much higher metabolic rate than the elephant.

The average daily rate of energy consumption is about two to four times an animal’s BMR or SMR. Humans are more sedentary than most animals and have an average daily rate of only 1.5 times the BMR. The diet of an endothermic animal is determined by its BMR. For example: the type of grasses, leaves, or shrubs that an herbivore eats affects the number of calories that it takes in. The relative caloric content of herbivore foods, in descending order, is tall grasses &gt; legumes &gt; short grasses &gt; forbs (any broad-leaved plant, not a grass) &gt; subshrubs &gt; annuals/biennials.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Energy Requirements Related to Environment"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44730-fs-idm60275632" style="text-align: left;">Energy Requirements Related to Environment</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Animals adapt to extremes of temperature or food availability through torpor. <strong>Torpor</strong> is a process that leads to a decrease in activity and metabolism and allows animals to survive adverse conditions. Torpor can be used by animals for long periods, such as entering a state of <strong>hibernation</strong> during the winter months, in which case it enables them to maintain a reduced body temperature. During hibernation, ground squirrels can achieve an abdominal temperature of 0° C (32° F), while a bear’s internal temperature is maintained higher at about 37° C (99° F).</p> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idp111877872"></span>If torpor occurs during the summer months with high temperatures and little water, it is called <span id="m44730-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1479274"></span><strong>estivation</strong>. Some desert animals use this to survive the harshest months of the year. Torpor can occur on a daily basis; this is seen in bats and hummingbirds. While endothermy is limited in smaller animals by surface to volume ratio, some organisms can be smaller and still be endotherms because they employ daily torpor during the part of the day that is coldest. This allows them to conserve energy during the colder parts of the day, when they consume more energy to maintain their body temperature.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Animal Body Planes and Cavities"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44730-fs-idm391168" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Animal Body Planes and Cavities</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idm129981648"></span>A standing vertebrate animal can be divided by several planes.

They can work in a variety of settings, although most will have an academic appointment at a university, usually in an anthropology department or a biology, genetics, or zoology department.</p> <p><span id="m44730-fs-idp33812720"></span>Non-academic positions are available in the automotive and aerospace industries where the focus is on human size, shape, and anatomy. Research by these professionals might range from studies of how the human body reacts to car crashes to exploring how to make seats more comfortable. Other non-academic positions can be obtained in museums of natural history, anthropology, archaeology, or science and technology. These positions involve educating students from grade school through graduate school. Physical anthropologists serve as education coordinators, collection managers, writers for museum publications, and as administrators. Zoos employ these professionals, especially if they have an expertise in primate biology; they work in collection management and captive breeding programs for endangered species. Forensic science utilizes physical anthropology expertise in identifying human and animal remains, assisting in determining the cause of death, and for expert testimony in trials.</p> <div id="id763208" class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <p><strong>asymmetrical: </strong>describes animals with no axis of symmetry in their body pattern<br /> <strong>basal metabolic rate (BMR): </strong>metabolic rate at rest in endothermic animals<br /> <strong>cartilage: </strong>type of connective tissue with a large amount of ground substance matrix, cells called chondrocytes, and some amount of fibers<br /> <strong>chondrocyte: </strong>cell found in cartilage<br /> <strong>columnar epithelia: </strong>epithelia made of cells taller than they are wide, specialized in absorption<br /> <strong>connective tissue: </strong>type of tissue made of cells, ground substance matrix, and fibers<br /> <strong>cuboidal epithelia: </strong>epithelia made of cube-shaped cells, specialized in glandular functions<br /> <strong>dorsal cavity: </strong>body cavity on the posterior or back portion of an animal; includes the cranial and vertebral cavities<br /> <strong>ectotherm: </strong>animal incapable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature<strong>endotherm: </strong>animal capable of maintaining a relatively constant internal body temperature<br /> <strong>estivation: </strong>torpor in response to extremely high temperatures and low water availability<br /> <strong>fibrous connective tissue: </strong>type of connective tissue with a high concentration of fibers<br /> <strong>fusiform: </strong>animal body shape that is tubular and tapered at both ends<br /> <strong>hibernation: </strong>torpor over a long period of time, such as a winter<br /> <strong>homeostasis: </strong>dynamic equilibrium maintaining appropriate body functions<br /> <strong>lacuna: </strong>space in cartilage and bone that contains living cells<br /> <strong>matrix: </strong>component of connective tissue made of both living and non-living (ground substances) cells<br /> <strong>midsagittal plane: </strong>plane cutting through an animal separating the individual into even right and left sides<br /> <strong>negative feedback loop: </strong>feedback to a control mechanism that increases or decreases a stimulus instead of maintaining it<br /> <strong>osteon: </strong>subunit of compact bone<br /> <strong>positive feedback loop:</strong>feedback to a control mechanism that continues the direction of a stimulus<br /> <strong>sagittal plane: </strong>plane cutting through an animal separating the individual into right and left sides<br /> <strong>set point: </strong>midpoint or target point in homeostasis<br /> <strong>squamous epithelia: </strong>type of epithelia made of flat cells, specialized in aiding diffusion or preventing abrasion<br /> <strong>standard metabolic rate (SMR): </strong>metabolic rate at rest in ectothermic animals<br /> <strong>stratified epithelia: </strong>multiple layers of epithelial cells<br /> <strong>torpor: </strong>decrease in activity and metabolism that allows an animal to survive adverse conditions<br /> <strong>ventral cavity: </strong>body cavity on the anterior or front portion of an animal that includes the thoracic cavities and the abdominopelvic cavities</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="cnx-eoc art-exercise"><div class="section empty"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="exercise"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>

The ground substance is made of an organic substance (usually a protein) and an inorganic substance (usually a mineral or water). The principal cell of connective tissues is the fibroblast. This cell makes the fibers found in nearly all of the connective tissues. Fibroblasts are motile, able to carry out mitosis, and can synthesize whichever connective tissue is needed. Macrophages, lymphocytes, and, occasionally, leukocytes can be found in some of the tissues. Some tissues have specialized cells that are not found in the others. The <span id="m44731-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1288225"></span><strong>matrix</strong> in connective tissues gives the tissue its density. When a connective tissue has a high concentration of cells or fibers, it has proportionally a less dense matrix.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idm109329920"></span>The organic portion or protein fibers found in connective tissues are either collagen, elastic, or reticular fibers. Collagen fibers provide strength to the tissue, preventing it from being torn or separated from the surrounding tissues. Elastic fibers are made of the protein elastin; this fiber can stretch to one and one half of its length and return to its original size and shape. Elastic fibers provide flexibility to the tissues. Reticular fibers are the third type of protein fiber found in connective tissues. This fiber consists of thin strands of collagen that form a network of fibers to support the tissue and other organs to which it is connected.

The organic matrix is similar to the matrix material found in other connective tissues, including some amount of collagen and elastic fibers. This gives strength and flexibility to the tissue. The inorganic matrix consists of mineral salts—mostly calcium salts—that give the tissue hardness. Without adequate organic material in the matrix, the tissue breaks; without adequate inorganic material in the matrix, the tissue bends.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp181421152"></span>There are three types of cells in bone: osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are active in making bone for growth and remodeling. Osteoblasts deposit bone material into the matrix and, after the matrix surrounds them, they continue to live, but in a reduced metabolic state as osteocytes. Osteocytes are found in lacunae of the bone. Osteoclasts are active in breaking down bone for bone remodeling, and they provide access to calcium stored in tissues. Osteoclasts are usually found on the surface of the tissue.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp87114896"></span>Bone can be divided into two types: compact and spongy. Compact bone is found in the shaft (or diaphysis) of a long bone and the surface of the flat bones, while spongy bone is found in the end (or epiphysis) of a long bone. Compact bone is organized into subunits called <span id="m44731-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1496081"></span><strong>osteons</strong>, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.15.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1107" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/14-2-animal-primary-tissues/#attachment_1107">Figure 14.15</a>.

Erythrocytes (red blood cells), the predominant cell type, are involved in the transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Also present are various leukocytes (white blood cells) involved in immune response.</div></div> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp37218608"></span>The cell found in greatest abundance in blood is the erythrocyte. Erythrocytes are counted in millions in a blood sample: the average number of red blood cells in primates is 4.7 to 5.5 million cells per microliter. Erythrocytes are consistently the same size in a species, but vary in size between species. For example, the average diameter of a primate red blood cell is 7.5 µl, a dog is close at 7.0 µl, but a cat’s RBC diameter is 5.9 µl. Sheep erythrocytes are even smaller at 4.6 µl. Mammalian erythrocytes lose their nuclei and mitochondria when they are released from the bone marrow where they are made. Fish, amphibian, and avian red blood cells maintain their nuclei and mitochondria throughout the cell’s life. The principal job of an erythrocyte is to carry and deliver oxygen to the tissues.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp88868976"></span>Leukocytes are the predominant white blood cells found in the peripheral blood. Leukocytes are counted in the thousands in the blood with measurements expressed as ranges: primate counts range from 4,800 to 10,800 cells per µl, dogs from 5,600 to 19,200 cells per µl, cats from 8,000 to 25,000 cells per µl, cattle from 4,000 to 12,000 cells per µl, and pigs from 11,000 to 22,000 cells per µl.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idm54318864"></span>Lymphocytes function primarily in the immune response to foreign antigens or material. Different types of lymphocytes make antibodies tailored to the foreign antigens and control the production of those antibodies. Neutrophils are phagocytic cells and they participate in one of the early lines of defense against microbial invaders, aiding in the removal of bacteria that has entered the body. Another leukocyte that is found in the peripheral blood is the monocyte. Monocytes give rise to phagocytic macrophages that clean up dead and damaged cells in the body, whether they are foreign or from the host animal. Two additional leukocytes in the blood are eosinophils and basophils—both help to facilitate the inflammatory response.</p> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp50420432"></span>The slightly granular material among the cells is a cytoplasmic fragment of a cell in the bone marrow. This is called a platelet or thrombocyte. Platelets participate in the stages leading up to coagulation of the blood to stop bleeding through damaged blood vessels. Blood has a number of functions, but primarily it transports material through the body to bring nutrients to cells and remove waste material from them.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Muscle Tissues"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44731-fs-idm35015984" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Muscle Tissues</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44731-fs-idp1620528"></span>There are three types of muscle in animal bodies: smooth, skeletal, and cardiac.

If a cell exceeds this distance in its size, the center of the cell cannot get adequate nutrients nor can it expel enough waste to survive. To compensate for this, cells can loosely adhere to each other in a liquid medium, or develop into multi-celled organisms that use circulatory and respiratory systems to deliver nutrients and remove wastes.</li> <li>Basal Metabolic Rate is an expression of the metabolic processes that occur to maintain an individual’s functioning and body temperature. Smaller bodied animals have a relatively large surface area compared to a much larger animal. The large animal’s large surface area leads to increased heat loss that the animal must compensate for, resulting in a higher BMR. A small animal, having less relative surface area, does not lose as much heat and has a correspondingly lower BMR.</li> <li>Squamous epithelia can be either simple or stratified.

Both tissues participate in vertebrate skeletal development and formation.</li> <li>An adjustment to a change in the internal or external environment requires a change in the direction of the stimulus. A negative feedback loop accomplishes this, while a positive feedback loop would continue the stimulus and result in harm to the animal.</li> <li>Mammalian enzymes increase activity to the point of denaturation, increasing the chemical activity of the cells involved.

These changes might be in the level of glucose or calcium in blood or in external temperatures. <strong><span id="m44733-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1421832"></span>Homeostasis</strong> means to maintain dynamic equilibrium in the body. It is dynamic because it is constantly adjusting to the changes that the body’s systems encounter. It is equilibrium because body functions are kept within specific ranges. Even an animal that is apparently inactive is maintaining this homeostatic equilibrium.</p> <div class="section" title="Homeostatic Process"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44733-fs-idm72988560" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Homeostatic Process</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp90311888"></span>The goal of homeostasis is the maintenance of equilibrium around a point or value called a <span id="m44733-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1421854"></span><strong>set point</strong>. While there are normal fluctuations from the set point, the body’s systems will usually attempt to go back to this point. A change in the internal or external environment is called a stimulus and is detected by a receptor; the response of the system is to adjust the deviation parameter toward the set point. For instance, if the body becomes too warm, adjustments are made to cool the animal. If the blood’s glucose rises after a meal, adjustments are made to lower the blood glucose level by getting the nutrient into tissues that need it or to store it for later use.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Control of Homeostasis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44733-fs-idp78091184" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Control of Homeostasis</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm41037936"></span>When a change occurs in an animal’s environment, an adjustment must be made. The receptor senses the change in the environment, then sends a signal to the control center (in most cases, the brain) which in turn generates a response that is signaled to an effector. The effector is a muscle (that contracts or relaxes) or a gland that secretes. Homeostatsis is maintained by negative feedback loops. Positive feedback loops actually push the organism further out of homeostasis, but may be necessary for life to occur. Homeostasis is controlled by the nervous and endocrine system of mammals.</p> <div class="section" title="Negative Feedback Mechanisms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44733-fs-idp123894688" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Negative Feedback Mechanisms</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm5619632"></span>Any homeostatic process that changes the direction of the stimulus is a <span id="m44733-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1291061"></span><strong>negative feedback loop</strong>. It may either increase or decrease the stimulus, but the stimulus is not allowed to continue as it did before the receptor sensed it. In other words, if a level is too high, the body does something to bring it down, and conversely, if a level is too low, the body does something to make it go up. Hence the term negative feedback. An example is animal maintenance of blood glucose levels. When an animal has eaten, blood glucose levels rise. This is sensed by the nervous system. Specialized cells in the pancreas sense this, and the hormone insulin is released by the endocrine system. Insulin causes blood glucose levels to decrease, as would be expected in a negative feedback system, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.20.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1113" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/14-3-homeostasis/#attachment_1113">Figure 14.20</a>. However, if an animal has not eaten and blood glucose levels decrease, this is sensed in another group of cells in the pancreas, and the hormone glucagon is released causing glucose levels to increase. This is still a negative feedback loop, but not in the direction expected by the use of the term “negative.” Another example of an increase as a result of the feedback loop is the control of blood calcium. If calcium levels decrease, specialized cells in the parathyroid gland sense this and release parathyroid hormone (PTH), causing an increased absorption of calcium through the intestines and kidneys and, possibly, the breakdown of bone in order to liberate calcium. The effects of PTH are to raise blood levels of the element. Negative feedback loops are the predominant mechanism used in homeostasis.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1113" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1113" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4789" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1.jpg" alt="Figure_33_03_01" width="600" height="284" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1-300x142.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1-768x364.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1-65x31.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1-225x107.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_33_03_01-1024x485-1-350x166.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1113">Figure 14.20.&nbsp; Blood sugar levels are controlled by a negative feedback loop.

Few examples of positive feedback loops exist in animal bodies, but one is found in the cascade of chemical reactions that result in blood clotting, or coagulation. As one clotting factor is activated, it activates the next factor in sequence until a fibrin clot is achieved. The direction is maintained, not changed, so this is positive feedback. Another example of positive feedback is uterine contractions during childbirth, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.21.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1114" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/14-3-homeostasis/#attachment_1114">Figure 14.21</a>. The hormone oxytocin, made by the endocrine system, stimulates the contraction of the uterus. This produces pain sensed by the nervous system. Instead of lowering the oxytocin and causing the pain to subside, more oxytocin is produced until the contractions are powerful enough to produce childbirth.</p> <div id="m44733-fs-idp115293136" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1114" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1114" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4790" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02.png" alt="Figure_33_03_02" width="400" height="375" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02.png 469w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02-300x281.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02-65x61.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02-225x211.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_02-350x328.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1114">Figure 14.21.&nbsp; The birth of a human infant is the result of positive feedback.</div></div> <div id="m44733-fig-ch33_03_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.21.&nbsp;"><div class="title"></div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp24380096"></span>State whether each of the following processes is regulated by a positive feedback loop or a negative feedback loop.</p> <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">A person feels satiated after eating a large meal.</li> <li class="listitem">The blood has plenty of red blood cells.

When this happens, the feedback loop works to maintain the new setting. An example of this is blood pressure: over time, the normal or set point for blood pressure can increase as a result of continued increases in blood pressure. The body no longer recognizes the elevation as abnormal and no attempt is made to return to the lower set point. The result is the maintenance of an elevated blood pressure that can have harmful effects on the body. Medication can lower blood pressure and lower the set point in the system to a more healthy level. This is called a process of <span id="m44733-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1526345"></span><strong>alteration</strong> of the set point in a feedback loop.</p> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp51301552"></span>Changes can be made in a group of body organ systems in order to maintain a set point in another system. This is called <span id="m44733-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1526355"></span><strong>acclimatization</strong>. This occurs, for instance, when an animal migrates to a higher altitude than it is accustomed to. In order to adjust to the lower oxygen levels at the new altitude, the body increases the number of red blood cells circulating in the blood to ensure adequate oxygen delivery to the tissues. Another example of acclimatization is animals that have seasonal changes in their coats: a heavier coat in the winter ensures adequate heat retention, and a light coat in summer assists in keeping body temperature from rising to harmful levels.</p> <div id="m44733-fs-idp26892032" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44733-fs-idm39579712"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/feedback_loops.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp120599664"></span>Feedback mechanisms can be understood in terms of driving a race car along a track: watch a short <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/feedback_loops" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/feedback_loops">video lesson</a> on positive and negative feedback loops.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Homeostasis: Thermoregulation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44733-fs-idm77157600" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Homeostasis: Thermoregulation</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm95344448"></span>Body temperature affects body activities. Generally, as body temperature rises, enzyme activity rises as well. For every ten degree centigrade rise in temperature, enzyme activity doubles, up to a point. Body proteins, including enzymes, begin to denature and lose their function with high heat (around 50<sup>o</sup>C for mammals). Enzyme activity will decrease by half for every ten degree centigrade drop in temperature, to the point of freezing, with a few exceptions. Some fish can withstand freezing solid and return to normal with thawing.</p> <div id="m44733-fs-idp31716480" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="title"></div> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44733-fs-idp30753968"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/thermoregulate.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp47826928"></span>Watch this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/thermoregulate">Discovery Channel video</a> on thermoregulation to see illustrations of this process in a variety of animals.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Endotherms and Ectotherms"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44733-fs-idm20890400" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Endotherms and Ectotherms</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm10383264"></span>Animals can be divided into two groups: some maintain a constant body temperature in the face of differing environmental temperatures, while others have a body temperature that is the same as their environment and thus varies with the environment. Animals that do not control their body temperature are ectotherms. This group has been called cold-blooded, but the term may not apply to an animal in the desert with a very warm body temperature. In contrast to ectotherms, which rely on external temperatures to set their body temperatures, poikilotherms are animals with constantly varying internal temperatures. An animal that maintains a constant body temperature in the face of environmental changes is called a homeotherm. Endotherms are animals that rely on internal sources for body temperature but which can exhibit extremes in temperature. These animals are able to maintain a level of activity at cooler temperature, which an ectotherm cannot due to differing enzyme levels of activity.</p> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp55656192"></span>Heat can be exchanged between an animal and its environment through four mechanisms: radiation, evaporation, convection, and conduction (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;33.22.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1117" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/14-3-homeostasis/#attachment_1117">Figure 14.22</a>). Radiation is the emission of electromagnetic “heat” waves. Heat comes from the sun in this manner and radiates from dry skin the same way. Heat can be removed with liquid from a surface during evaporation. This occurs when a mammal sweats. Convection currents of air remove heat from the surface of dry skin as the air passes over it. Heat will be conducted from one surface to another during direct contact with the surfaces, such as an animal resting on a warm rock.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1117" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1117" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_33_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4793" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1.jpg" alt="Figure_33_03_03" width="600" height="463" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1-300x231.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1-768x593.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1-65x50.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1-225x174.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_33_03_03-1024x790-1-350x270.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1117">Figure 14.22.&nbsp; Heat can be exchanged by four mechanisms: (a) radiation, (b) evaporation, (c) convection, or (d) conduction.

In certain climates, endothermic animals have some form of insulation, such as fur, fat, feathers, or some combination thereof. Animals with thick fur or feathers create an insulating layer of air between their skin and internal organs. Polar bears and seals live and swim in a subfreezing environment and yet maintain a constant, warm, body temperature. The arctic fox, for example, uses its fluffy tail as extra insulation when it curls up to sleep in cold weather. Mammals have a residual effect from shivering and increased muscle activity: arrector pili muscles cause “goose bumps,” causing small hairs to stand up when the individual is cold; this has the intended effect of increasing body temperature. Mammals use layers of fat to achieve the same end. Loss of significant amounts of body fat will compromise an individual’s ability to conserve heat.</p> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm92432784"></span>Endotherms use their circulatory systems to help maintain body temperature. Vasodilation brings more blood and heat to the body surface, facilitating radiation and evaporative heat loss, which helps to cool the body. Vasoconstriction reduces blood flow in peripheral blood vessels, forcing blood toward the core and the vital organs found there, and conserving heat. Some animals have adaptions to their circulatory system that enable them to transfer heat from arteries to veins, warming blood returning to the heart. This is called a countercurrent heat exchange; it prevents the cold venous blood from cooling the heart and other internal organs. This adaption can be shut down in some animals to prevent overheating the internal organs. The countercurrent adaption is found in many animals, including dolphins, sharks, bony fish, bees, and hummingbirds. In contrast, similar adaptations can help cool endotherms when needed, such as dolphin flukes and elephant ears.</p> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idm52152832"></span>Some ectothermic animals use changes in their behavior to help regulate body temperature. For example, a desert ectothermic animal may simply seek cooler areas during the hottest part of the day in the desert to keep from getting too warm. The same animals may climb onto rocks to capture heat during a cold desert night. Some animals seek water to aid evaporation in cooling them, as seen with reptiles. Other ectotherms use group activity such as the activity of bees to warm a hive to survive winter.</p> <p><span id="m44733-fs-idp157215920"></span>Many animals, especially mammals, use metabolic waste heat as a heat source. When muscles are contracted, most of the energy from the ATP used in muscle actions is wasted energy that translates into heat.

It responds to chemicals from the body. When a bacterium is destroyed by phagocytic leukocytes, chemicals called endogenous pyrogens are released into the blood. These pyrogens circulate to the hypothalamus and reset the thermostat. This allows the body’s temperature to increase in what is commonly called a fever. An increase in body temperature causes iron to be conserved, which reduces a nutrient needed by bacteria. An increase in body heat also increases the activity of the animal’s enzymes and protective cells while inhibiting the enzymes and activity of the invading microorganisms. Finally, heat itself may also kill the pathogen. A fever that was once thought to be a complication of an infection is now understood to be a normal defense mechanism.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="title"></div> <div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="chapter" title="Chapter 33.

If a cell exceeds this distance in its size, the center of the cell cannot get adequate nutrients nor can it expel enough waste to survive.

Smaller bodied animals have a relatively large surface area compared to a much larger animal.

A negative feedback loop accomplishes this, while a positive feedback loop would continue the stimulus and result in harm to the animal.</li> <li>Mammalian enzymes increase activity to the point of denaturation, increasing the chemical activity of the cells involved. Bacterial enzymes have a specific temperature for their most efficient activity and are inhibited at either higher or lower temperatures. Fever results in an increase in the destruction of the invading bacteria by increasing the effectiveness of body defenses and an inhibiting bacterial metabolism.</li> <li>Diabetes is often associated with a lack in production of insulin.

While plants can obtain the molecules required for cellular function through the process of photosynthesis, most animals obtain their nutrients by the consumption of other organisms. At the cellular level, the biological molecules necessary for animal function are amino acids, lipid molecules, nucleotides, and simple sugars. However, the food consumed consists of protein, fat, and complex carbohydrates. Animals must convert these macromolecules into the simple molecules required for maintaining cellular functions, such as assembling new molecules, cells, and tissues. The conversion of the food consumed to the nutrients required is a multi-step process involving digestion and absorption. During digestion, food particles are broken down to smaller components, and later, they are absorbed by the body.</p> <p><span id="m44734-fs-idm68757552"></span>One of the challenges in human nutrition is maintaining a balance between food intake, storage, and energy expenditure. Imbalances can have serious health consequences. For example, eating too much food while not expending much energy leads to obesity, which in turn will increase the risk of developing illnesses such as type-2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. The recent rise in obesity and related diseases makes understanding the role of diet and nutrition in maintaining good health all the more important.</p> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Depending on their diet, animals can be classified into the following categories: plant eaters (herbivores), meat eaters (carnivores), and those that eat both plants and animals (omnivores). The nutrients and macromolecules present in food are not immediately accessible to the cells. There are a number of processes that modify food within the animal body in order to make the nutrients and organic molecules accessible for cellular function. As animals evolved in complexity of form and function, their digestive systems have also evolved to accommodate their various dietary needs.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44736-fs-idp196362976"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp23296176"></span><strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1599391"></span>Herbivores</strong> are animals whose primary food source is plant-based.

The simplest example is that of a <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1612206"></span><strong>gastrovascular cavity</strong> and is found in organisms with only one opening for digestion. Platyhelminthes (flatworms), Ctenophora (comb jellies), and Cnidaria (coral, jelly fish, and sea anemones) use this type of digestion. Gastrovascular cavities, as shown in Figure 15.5 <span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>, are typically a blind tube or cavity with only one opening, the “mouth”, which also serves as an “anus”. Ingested material enters the mouth and passes through a hollow, tubular cavity. Cells within the cavity secrete digestive enzymes that break down the food. The food particles are engulfed by the cells lining the gastrovascular cavity.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp41840320"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1612232"></span><strong>alimentary canal</strong>, shown in Figure 15.5 <span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>, is a more advanced system: it consists of one tube with a mouth at one end and an anus at the other. Earthworms are an example of an animal with an alimentary canal. Once the food is ingested through the mouth, it passes through the esophagus and is stored in an organ called the crop; then it passes into the gizzard where it is churned and digested. From the gizzard, the food passes through the intestine, the nutrients are absorbed, and the waste is eliminated as feces, called castings, through the anus.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1124" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1124" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_04ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_04ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4803" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1.jpg" alt="Figure_34_01_04ab" width="450" height="312" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1-300x208.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1-768x533.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1-225x156.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_04ab-1024x710-1-350x243.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1124">Figure 15.5.&nbsp; (a) A gastrovascular cavity has a single opening through which food is ingested and waste is excreted, as shown in this hydra and in this jellyfish medusa.

Humans and many animals have a monogastric digestive system as illustrated in Figure 15.6 <span class="bold"><strong>ab</strong></span>. The process of digestion begins with the mouth and the intake of food. The teeth play an important role in masticating (chewing) or physically breaking down food into smaller particles. The enzymes present in saliva also begin to chemically break down food. The esophagus is a long tube that connects the mouth to the stomach. Using peristalsis, or wave-like smooth muscle contractions, the muscles of the esophagus push the food towards the stomach. In order to speed up the actions of enzymes in the stomach, the stomach is an extremely acidic environment, with a pH between 1.5 and 2.5. The gastric juices, which include enzymes in the stomach, act on the food particles and continue the process of digestion. Further breakdown of food takes place in the small intestine where enzymes produced by the liver, the small intestine, and the pancreas continue the process of digestion. The nutrients are absorbed into the blood stream across the epithelial cells lining the walls of the small intestines. The waste material travels on to the large intestine where water is absorbed and the drier waste material is compacted into feces; it is stored until it is excreted through the rectum.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1125" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_05ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4804" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_05ab-1024x734-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;34.6.&nbsp; (a) Humans and herbivores, such as the (b) rabbit, have a monogastric digestive system.

They do not have teeth and so their digestive system, shown in Figure 15.7, must be able to process un-masticated food. Birds have evolved a variety of beak types that reflect the vast variety in their diet, ranging from seeds and insects to fruits and nuts. Because most birds fly, their metabolic rates are high in order to efficiently process food and keep their body weight low. The stomach of birds has two chambers: the <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1596712"></span><strong>proventriculus</strong>, where gastric juices are produced to digest the food before it enters the stomach, and the <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1596716"></span><strong>gizzard</strong>, where the food is stored, soaked, and mechanically ground.

The food consumed is broken into smaller particles by mastication, the chewing action of the teeth. All mammals have teeth and can chew their food.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp41971632"></span>The extensive chemical process of digestion begins in the mouth. As food is being chewed, saliva, produced by the salivary glands, mixes with the food. Saliva is a watery substance produced in the mouths of many animals. There are three major glands that secrete saliva—the parotid, the submandibular, and the sublingual. Saliva contains mucus that moistens food and buffers the pH of the food. Saliva also contains immunoglobulins and lysozymes, which have antibacterial action to reduce tooth decay by inhibiting growth of some bacteria. Saliva also contains an enzyme called <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1514721"></span><strong>salivary amylase</strong> that begins the process of converting starches in the food into a disaccharide called maltose. Another enzyme called <strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1514726"></span>lipase</strong> is produced by the cells in the tongue. Lipases are a class of enzymes that can break down triglycerides. The lingual lipase begins the breakdown of fat components in the food. The chewing and wetting action provided by the teeth and saliva prepare the food into a mass called the <strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1514732"></span>bolus</strong> for swallowing. The tongue helps in swallowing—moving the bolus from the mouth into the pharynx. The pharynx opens to two passageways: the trachea, which leads to the lungs, and the esophagus, which leads to the stomach. The trachea has an opening called the glottis, which is covered by a cartilaginous flap called the epiglottis. When swallowing, the epiglottis closes the glottis and food passes into the esophagus and not the trachea. This arrangement allows food to be kept out of the trachea.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1128" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1128" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_08ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_08ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4806" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_08ab-1024x518-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;34.9.&nbsp; Digestion of food begins in the (a) oral cavity.

This characteristic is particularly useful for animals that need to eat when food is available.</p> <div id="m44736-fs-idp1831296" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><h3></h3> <div class="body"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1130" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1130" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_10f.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_10f.png"><img class="wp-image-4808" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f.png" alt="Figure_34_01_10f" width="450" height="324" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f.png 725w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f-300x216.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f-65x47.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f-225x162.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_10f-350x252.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1130">Figure 15.11.&nbsp; The human stomach has an extremely acidic environment where most of the protein gets digested.

Protein digestion is mediated by an enzyme called pepsin in the stomach chamber. <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680516"></span><strong>Pepsin</strong> is secreted by the chief cells in the stomach in an inactive form called <strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680520"></span>pepsinogen</strong>. Pepsin breaks peptide bonds and cleaves proteins into smaller polypeptides; it also helps activate more pepsinogen, starting a positive feedback mechanism that generates more pepsin. Another cell type—parietal cells—secrete hydrogen and chloride ions, which combine in the lumen to form hydrochloric acid, the primary acidic component of the stomach juices. Hydrochloric acid helps to convert the inactive pepsinogen to pepsin. The highly acidic environment also kills many microorganisms in the food and, combined with the action of the enzyme pepsin, results in the hydrolysis of protein in the food. Chemical digestion is facilitated by the churning action of the stomach. Contraction and relaxation of smooth muscles mixes the stomach contents about every 20 minutes. The partially digested food and gastric juice mixture is called <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680530"></span><strong>chyme</strong>. Chyme passes from the stomach to the small intestine. Further protein digestion takes place in the small intestine. Gastric emptying occurs within two to six hours after a meal. Only a small amount of chyme is released into the small intestine at a time. The movement of chyme from the stomach into the small intestine is regulated by the pyloric sphincter.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp125384464"></span>When digesting protein and some fats, the stomach lining must be protected from getting digested by pepsin. There are two points to consider when describing how the stomach lining is protected. First, as previously mentioned, the enzyme pepsin is synthesized in the inactive form. This protects the chief cells, because pepsinogen does not have the same enzyme functionality of pepsin. Second, the stomach has a thick mucus lining that protects the underlying tissue from the action of the digestive juices. When this mucus lining is ruptured, ulcers can form in the stomach. Ulcers are open wounds in or on an organ caused by bacteria <strong>(<span class="emphasis">Helicobacter pylori</span>)</strong> when the mucus lining is ruptured and fails to reform.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Small Intestine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44736-fs-idp121333024"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Small Intestine</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp216789728"></span>Chyme moves from the stomach to the small intestine. The <strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1683746"></span>small intestine</strong> is the organ where the digestion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates is completed. The small intestine is a long tube-like organ with a highly folded surface containing finger-like projections called the <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1683752"></span><strong>villi</strong>. The apical surface of each villus has many microscopic projections called microvilli. These structures, illustrated in Figure 15.12, are lined with epithelial cells on the luminal side and allow for the nutrients to be absorbed from the digested food and absorbed into the blood stream on the other side. The villi and microvilli, with their many folds, increase the surface area of the intestine and increase absorption efficiency of the nutrients. Absorbed nutrients in the blood are carried into the hepatic portal vein, which leads to the liver. There, the liver regulates the distribution of nutrients to the rest of the body and removes toxic substances, including drugs, alcohol, and some pathogens.</p> <div id="m44736-fs-idp164007664" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><h3></h3> <div class="body"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1131" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1131" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_11f.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_11f.png"><img class="wp-image-4809" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1.png" alt="Figure_34_01_11f" width="500" height="236" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1-300x142.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1-768x363.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1-65x31.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1-225x106.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_11f-1024x484-1-350x165.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1131">Figure 15.12.&nbsp; Villi are folds on the small intestine lining that increase the surface area to facilitate the absorption of nutrients.</div></div> <div id="m44736-fig-ch34_01_11" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;34.12.&nbsp;"><div class="body"></div> <div class="body">Which of the following statements about the small intestine is false?</div> </div> <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food.</li> <li class="listitem">The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi.</li> <li class="listitem">Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels.</li> <li class="listitem">The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp109217840"></span>The human small intestine is over 6m long and is divided into three parts: the duodenum, the jejunum, and the ileum. The “C-shaped,” fixed part of the small intestine is called the <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1684541"></span><strong>duodenum</strong> and is shown in <a href="#attachment_1130" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-1-digestive-systems/#attachment_1130">Figure 15.11</a>. The duodenum is separated from the stomach by the pyloric sphincter which opens to allow chyme to move from the stomach to the duodenum. In the duodenum, chyme is mixed with pancreatic juices in an alkaline solution rich in bicarbonate that neutralizes the acidity of chyme and acts as a buffer. Pancreatic juices also contain several digestive enzymes. Digestive juices from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder, as well as from gland cells of the intestinal wall itself, enter the duodenum. <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1684556"></span><strong>Bile</strong> is produced in the liver and stored and concentrated in the gallbladder. Bile contains bile salts which emulsify lipids while the pancreas produces enzymes that catabolize starches, disaccharides, proteins, and fats. These digestive juices break down the food particles in the chyme into glucose, triglycerides, and amino acids. Some chemical digestion of food takes place in the duodenum. Absorption of fatty acids also takes place in the duodenum.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp250965392"></span>The second part of the small intestine is called the <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1684569"></span><strong>jejunum</strong>, shown in <a href="#attachment_1130" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-1-digestive-systems/#attachment_1130">Figure 15.11</a>. Here, hydrolysis of nutrients is continued while most of the carbohydrates and amino acids are absorbed through the intestinal lining. The bulk of chemical digestion and nutrient absorption occurs in the jejunum.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp35143728"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1684586"></span><strong>ileum</strong>, also illustrated in <a href="#attachment_1130" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-1-digestive-systems/#attachment_1130">Figure 15.11</a> is the last part of the small intestine and here the bile salts and vitamins are absorbed into blood stream. The undigested food is sent to the colon from the ileum via peristaltic movements of the muscle. The ileum ends and the large intestine begins at the ileocecal valve. The vermiform, “worm-like,” appendix is located at the ileocecal valve. The appendix of humans secretes no enzymes and has an insignificant role in immunity.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Large Intestine"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44736-fs-idp257850256"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Large Intestine</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp69281472"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1684371"></span><strong>large intestine</strong>, illustrated in Figure 15.13, reabsorbs the water from the undigested food material and processes the waste material. The human large intestine is much smaller in length compared to the small intestine but larger in diameter. It has three parts: the cecum, the colon, and the rectum. The cecum joins the ileum to the colon and is the receiving pouch for the waste matter. The colon is home to many bacteria or “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestive processes. The colon can be divided into four regions, the ascending colon, the transverse colon, the descending colon and the sigmoid colon. The main functions of the colon are to extract the water and mineral salts from undigested food, and to store waste material. Carnivorous mammals have a shorter large intestine compared to herbivorous mammals due to their diet.</p> <div id="m44736-fig-ch34_01_12" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;34.13.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1132" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1132" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_12.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_01_12.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4810" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;34.13.&nbsp; The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated." width="400" height="266" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_01_12-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1132">Figure 15.13.&nbsp;<br />The large intestine reabsorbs water from undigested food and stores waste material until it is eliminated.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="title"></div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Rectum and Anus"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44736-fs-idm9026240"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Rectum and Anus</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp69076576"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1689013"></span>rectum is the terminal end of the large intestine, as shown in Figure 15.13.

Accessory organs are organs that add secretions (enzymes) that catabolize food into nutrients. Accessory organs include salivary glands, the liver, the pancreas, and the gallbladder. The liver, pancreas, and gallbladder are regulated by hormones in response to the food consumed.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp230093488"></span>The <strong><span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680134"></span>liver</strong> is the largest internal organ in humans and it plays a very important role in digestion of fats and detoxifying blood. The liver produces bile, a digestive juice that is required for the breakdown of fatty components of the food in the duodenum. The liver also processes the vitamins and fats and synthesizes many plasma proteins.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp230442896"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680147"></span><strong>pancreas</strong> is another important gland that secretes digestive juices. The chyme produced from the stomach is highly acidic in nature; the pancreatic juices contain high levels of bicarbonate, an alkali that neutralizes the acidic chyme. Additionally, the pancreatic juices contain a large variety of enzymes that are required for the digestion of protein and carbohydrates.</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp7246416"></span>The <span id="m44736-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1680159"></span><strong>gallbladder</strong> is a small organ that aids the liver by storing bile and concentrating bile salts. When chyme containing fatty acids enters the duodenum, the bile is secreted from the gallbladder into the duodenum.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Different animals have evolved different types of digestive systems specialized to meet their dietary needs. Humans and many other animals have monogastric digestive systems with a single-chambered stomach. Birds have evolved a digestive system that includes a gizzard where the food is crushed into smaller pieces. This compensates for their inability to masticate. Ruminants that consume large amounts of plant material have a multi-chambered stomach that digests roughage. Pseudo-ruminants have similar digestive processes as ruminants but do not have the four-compartment stomach. Processing food involves ingestion (eating), digestion (mechanical and enzymatic breakdown of large molecules), absorption (cellular uptake of nutrients), and elimination (removal of undigested waste as feces).</p> <p><span id="m44736-fs-idp22214512"></span>Many organs work together to digest food and absorb nutrients. The mouth is the point of ingestion and the location where both mechanical and chemical breakdown of food begins. Saliva contains an enzyme called amylase that breaks down carbohydrates. The food bolus travels through the esophagus by peristaltic movements to the stomach. The stomach has an extremely acidic environment. An enzyme called pepsin digests protein in the stomach. Further digestion and absorption take place in the small intestine. The large intestine reabsorbs water from the undigested food and stores waste until elimination.</p> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="cnx-eoc art-exercise"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44736-fs-idp100804720" class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="chapter" title="Chapter&nbsp;34.&nbsp;Animal Nutrition and the Digestive System"><div class="cnx-gentext-exercise cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><ol><li>Which of the following statements about the digestive system is false? <ol><li>Chyme is a mixture of food and digestive juices that is produced in the stomach.</li> <li>Food enters the large intestine before the small intestine.</li> <li>In the small intestine, chyme mixes with bile, which emulsifies fats.</li> <li>The stomach is separated from the small intestine by the pyloric sphincter.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following statements about the small intestine is false? <ol><li>Absorptive cells that line the small intestine have microvilli, small projections that increase surface area and aid in the absorption of food.</li> <li>The inside of the small intestine has many folds, called villi.</li> <li>Microvilli are lined with blood vessels as well as lymphatic vessels.</li> <li>The inside of the small intestine is called the lumen.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following is a pseudo-ruminant? <ol><li>cow</li> <li>pig</li> <li>crow</li> <li>horse</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following statements is untrue? <ol><li>Roughage takes a long time to digest.</li> <li>Birds eat large quantities at one time so that they can fly long distances.</li> <li>Cows do not have upper teeth.</li> <li>In pseudo-ruminants, roughage is digested in the cecum.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The acidic nature of chyme is neutralized by ________. <ol><li>potassium hydroxide</li> <li>sodium hydroxide</li> <li>bicarbonates</li> <li>vinegar</li> </ol> </li> <li>The digestive juices from the liver are delivered to the ________. <ol><li>stomach</li> <li>liver</li> <li>duodenum</li> <li>colon</li> </ol> </li> <li>How does the polygastric digestive system aid in digesting roughage?</li> <li>How do birds digest their food in the absence of teeth?</li> <li>What is the role of the accessory organs in digestion?</li> <li>Explain how the villi and microvilli aid in absorption.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc free-response"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44736-fs-idp106489616" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div id="m44736-fs-idm1671760" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>D</li> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>C</li> <li>Animals with a polygastric digestive system have a multi-chambered stomach.

The animal diet is the source of materials needed for building DNA and other complex molecules needed for growth, maintenance, and reproduction; collectively these processes are called biosynthesis. The diet is also the source of materials for ATP production in the cells.

To learn more about each food group and the recommended daily amounts, explore this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/food_groups" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/food_groups">interactive site</a> by the United States Department of Agriculture.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Organic Precursors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44740-fs-idp112136448"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Organic Precursors</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idm162453888"></span>The organic molecules required for building cellular material and tissues must come from food. Carbohydrates or sugars are the primary source of organic carbons in the animal body. During digestion, digestible carbohydrates are ultimately broken down into glucose and used to provide energy through metabolic pathways. Complex carbohydrates, including polysaccharides, can be broken down into glucose through biochemical modification; however, humans do not produce the enzyme cellulase and lack the ability to derive glucose from the polysaccharide cellulose. In humans, these molecules provide the fiber required for moving waste through the large intestine and a healthy colon. The intestinal flora in the human gut are able to extract some nutrition from these plant fibers. The excess sugars in the body are converted into glycogen and stored in the liver and muscles for later use. Glycogen stores are used to fuel prolonged exertions, such as long-distance running, and to provide energy during food shortage. Excess glycogen can be converted to fats, which are stored in the lower layer of the skin of mammals for insulation and energy storage. Excess digestible carbohydrates are stored by mammals in order to survive famine and aid in mobility.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idp61018384"></span>Another important requirement is that of nitrogen. Protein catabolism provides a source of organic nitrogen. Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins and protein breakdown provides amino acids that are used for cellular function. The carbon and nitrogen derived from these become the building block for nucleotides, nucleic acids, proteins, cells, and tissues. Excess nitrogen must be excreted as it is toxic. Fats add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness. Fatty foods are also significant sources of energy because one gram of fat contains nine calories. Fats are required in the diet to aid the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and the production of fat-soluble hormones.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Essential Nutrients"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 id="m44740-fs-idp170425168"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Essential Nutrients</span></span></h4> </div> </div> </div> <div class="textbox shaded" style="text-align: center;"><p></p> <div class="textbox interactive-content"><span class="interactive-content__icon"></span> <p>An interactive or media element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Homeostasis is the ability of a system to maintain a stable internal environment even in the face of external changes to the environment. For example, the normal body temperature of humans is 37°C (98.6°F). Humans maintain this temperature even when the external temperature is hot or cold. It takes energy to maintain this body temperature, and animals obtain this energy from food.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idm37577136"></span>The primary source of energy for animals is carbohydrates, mainly glucose. Glucose is called the body’s fuel. The digestible carbohydrates in an animal’s diet are converted to glucose molecules through a series of catabolic chemical reactions.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idm13831072"></span>Adenosine triphosphate, or ATP, is the primary energy currency in cells; ATP stores energy in phosphate ester bonds. ATP releases energy when the phosphodiester bonds are broken and ATP is converted to ADP and a phosphate group. ATP is produced by the oxidative reactions in the cytoplasm and mitochondrion of the cell, where carbohydrates, proteins, and fats undergo a series of metabolic reactions collectively called cellular respiration. For example, glycolysis is a series of reactions in which glucose is converted to pyruvic acid and some of its chemical potential energy is transferred to NADH and ATP.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idm44186032"></span>ATP is required for all cellular functions. It is used to build the organic molecules that are required for cells and tissues; it provides energy for muscle contraction and for the transmission of electrical signals in the nervous system. When the amount of ATP is available in excess of the body’s requirements, the liver uses the excess ATP and excess glucose to produce molecules called glycogen. Glycogen is a polymeric form of glucose and is stored in the liver and skeletal muscle cells. When blood sugar drops, the liver releases glucose from stores of glycogen. Skeletal muscle converts glycogen to glucose during intense exercise. The process of converting glucose and excess ATP to glycogen and the storage of excess energy is an evolutionarily important step in helping animals deal with mobility, food shortages, and famine.</p> <div id="m44740-fs-idm63810688" class="note everyday"><div class="title"><div class="body"><h2 class="title">Obesity</h2> <p title="Obesity">Obesity is a major health concern in the United States, and there is a growing focus on reducing obesity and the diseases it may lead to, such as type-2 diabetes, cancers of the colon and breast, and cardiovascular disease. How does the food consumed contribute to obesity?</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idp109819840"></span>Fatty foods are calorie-dense, meaning that they have more calories per unit mass than carbohydrates or proteins. One gram of carbohydrates has four calories, one gram of protein has four calories, and one gram of fat has nine calories. Animals tend to seek lipid-rich food for their higher energy content.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idp36727728"></span>The signals of hunger (“time to eat”) and satiety (“time to stop eating”) are controlled in the hypothalamus region of the brain. Foods that are rich in fatty acids tend to promote satiety more than foods that are rich only in carbohydrates.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idm155187248"></span>Excess carbohydrate and ATP are used by the liver to synthesize glycogen. The pyruvate produced during glycolysis is used to synthesize fatty acids. When there is more glucose in the body than required, the resulting excess pyruvate is converted into molecules that eventually result in the synthesis of fatty acids within the body. These fatty acids are stored in adipose cells—the fat cells in the mammalian body whose primary role is to store fat for later use.</p> <p><span id="m44740-fs-idp214566496"></span>It is important to note that some animals benefit from obesity. Polar bears and seals need body fat for insulation and to keep them from losing body heat during Arctic winters. When food is scarce, stored body fat provides energy for maintaining homeostasis. Fats prevent famine in mammals, allowing them to access energy when food is not available on a daily basis; fats are stored when a large kill is made or lots of food is available.</p> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><p><span id="m44740-fs-idm81983216"></span>Animal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food. Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in fat cells. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems. ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is obtained from the metabolic pathways. Excess carbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body.</p> <div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"></div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="cnx-eoc art-exercise"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44740-fs-idp141568560" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><ol><li>Which of the following statements is not true? <ol><li class="listitem">Essential nutrients can be synthesized by the body.</li> <li class="listitem">Vitamins are required in small quantities for bodily function.</li> <li class="listitem">Some amino acids can be synthesized by the body, while others need to be obtained from diet.</li> <li class="listitem">Vitamins come in two categories: fat-soluble and water-soluble.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following is a water-soluble vitamin? <ol><li class="listitem">vitamin A</li> <li class="listitem">vitamin E</li> <li class="listitem">vitamin K</li> <li class="listitem">vitamin C</li> </ol> </li> <li>What is the primary fuel for the body? <ol><li class="listitem">carbohydrates</li> <li class="listitem">lipids</li> <li class="listitem">protein</li> <li class="listitem">glycogen</li> </ol> </li> <li>Excess glucose is stored as ________. <ol><li class="listitem">fat</li> <li class="listitem">glucagon</li> <li class="listitem">glycogen</li> <li class="listitem">it is not stored in the body</li> </ol> </li> <li>What are essential nutrients?</li> <li>What is the role of minerals in maintaining good health?</li> <li>Discuss why obesity is a growing epidemic.</li> <li>There are several nations where malnourishment is a common occurrence.

For true animals, the first step is ingestion, the act of taking in food. This is followed by digestion, absorption, and elimination. In the following sections, each of these steps will be discussed in detail.</p> <div class="section" title="Ingestion"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idp200659168"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Ingestion</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idm49698080"></span>The large molecules found in intact food cannot pass through the cell membranes. Food needs to be broken into smaller particles so that animals can harness the nutrients and organic molecules. The first step in this process is <em class="glossterm"><span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1730087"></span>ingestion</em>. Ingestion is the process of taking in food through the mouth. In vertebrates, the teeth, saliva, and tongue play important roles in mastication (preparing the food into bolus). While the food is being mechanically broken down, the enzymes in saliva begin to chemically process the food as well. The combined action of these processes modifies the food from large particles to a soft mass that can be swallowed and can travel the length of the esophagus.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Digestion and Absorption"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idp88294896"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Digestion and Absorption</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp189049008"></span> <span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1730107"></span><strong>Digestion</strong> is the mechanical and chemical break down of food into small organic fragments. It is important to break down macromolecules into smaller fragments that are of suitable size for absorption across the digestive epithelium. Large, complex molecules of proteins, polysaccharides, and lipids must be reduced to simpler particles such as simple sugar before they can be absorbed by the digestive epithelial cells. Different organs play specific roles in the digestive process. The animal diet needs carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as vitamins and inorganic components for nutritional balance. How each of these components is digested is discussed in the following sections.</p> <div class="section" title="Carbohydrates"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idp8579792"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Carbohydrates</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp58217056"></span>The digestion of carbohydrates begins in the mouth. The salivary enzyme amylase begins the breakdown of food starches into maltose, a disaccharide. As the bolus of food travels through the esophagus to the stomach, no significant digestion of carbohydrates takes place. The esophagus produces no digestive enzymes but does produce mucous for lubrication. The acidic environment in the stomach stops the action of the amylase enzyme.</p> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp146527776"></span>The next step of carbohydrate digestion takes place in the duodenum. Recall that the chyme from the stomach enters the duodenum and mixes with the digestive secretion from the pancreas, liver, and gallbladder. Pancreatic juices also contain amylase, which continues the breakdown of starch and glycogen into maltose, a disaccharide. The disaccharides are broken down into monosaccharides by enzymes called <span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1722223"></span><strong>maltases</strong></p> </div> <p>, <span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1722227"></span>sucrases, and <strong><span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1722230"></span>lactases</strong>, which are also present in the brush border of the small intestinal wall. Maltase breaks down maltose into glucose. Other disaccharides, such as sucrose and lactose are broken down by sucrase and lactase, respectively. Sucrase breaks down sucrose (or “table sugar”) into glucose and fructose, and lactase breaks down lactose (or “milk sugar”) into glucose and galactose. The monosaccharides (glucose) thus produced are absorbed and then can be used in metabolic pathways to harness energy. The monosaccharides are transported across the intestinal epithelium into the bloodstream to be transported to the different cells in the body. The steps in carbohydrate digestion are summarized in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;34.16.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1136" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-3-digestive-system-processes/#attachment_1136">Figure 15.16</a> and <a class="xref target-table" title="Table&nbsp;34.5.&nbsp;" href="#m44742-tab-ch34_03_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-3-digestive-system-processes/#m44742-tab-ch34_03_01">Table 15.5</a>.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1136" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1136" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4818" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1.jpg" alt="Figure_34_03_01" width="600" height="168" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1-300x84.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1-768x215.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1-65x18.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1-225x63.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_34_03_01-1024x286-1-350x98.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1136">Figure 15.16.&nbsp; Digestion of carbohydrates is performed by several enzymes.

The enzyme pepsin plays an important role in the digestion of proteins by breaking down the intact protein to peptides, which are short chains of four to nine amino acids. In the duodenum, other enzymes—<strong><span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1740453"></span>trypsin, <span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1740456"></span>elastase</strong>, and <strong><span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1740460"></span>chymotrypsin</strong>—act on the peptides reducing them to smaller peptides. Trypsin elastase, carboxypeptidase, and chymotrypsin are produced by the pancreas and released into the duodenum where they act on the chyme. Further breakdown of peptides to single amino acids is aided by enzymes called peptidases (those that break down peptides).

However, the bulk of lipid digestion occurs in the small intestine due to pancreatic lipase. When chyme enters the duodenum, the hormonal responses trigger the release of bile, which is produced in the liver and stored in the gallbladder. Bile aids in the digestion of lipids, primarily triglycerides by emulsification. Emulsification is a process in which large lipid globules are broken down into several small lipid globules. These small globules are more widely distributed in the chyme rather than forming large aggregates. Lipids are hydrophobic substances: in the presence of water, they will aggregate to form globules to minimize exposure to water. Bile contains bile salts, which are amphipathic, meaning they contain hydrophobic and hydrophilic parts. Thus, the bile salts hydrophilic side can interface with water on one side and the hydrophobic side interfaces with lipids on the other. By doing so, bile salts emulsify large lipid globules into small lipid globules.</p> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp49872272"></span>Why is emulsification important for digestion of lipids? Pancreatic juices contain enzymes called lipases (enzymes that break down lipids). If the lipid in the chyme aggregates into large globules, very little surface area of the lipids is available for the lipases to act on, leaving lipid digestion incomplete. By forming an emulsion, bile salts increase the available surface area of the lipids many fold. The pancreatic lipases can then act on the lipids more efficiently and digest them, as detailed in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;34.18.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1138" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/15-3-digestive-system-processes/#attachment_1138">Figure 15.18</a>. Lipases break down the lipids into fatty acids and glycerides. These molecules can pass through the plasma membrane of the cell and enter the epithelial cells of the intestinal lining. The bile salts surround long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides forming tiny spheres called micelles. The micelles move into the brush border of the small intestine absorptive cells where the long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides diffuse out of the micelles into the absorptive cells leaving the micelles behind in the chyme. The long-chain fatty acids and monoglycerides recombine in the absorptive cells to form triglycerides, which aggregate into globules and become coated with proteins. These large spheres are called <span id="m44742-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1708747"></span><strong>chylomicrons</strong>. Chylomicrons contain triglycerides, cholesterol, and other lipids and have proteins on their surface. The surface is also composed of the hydrophilic phosphate “heads” of phospholipids. Together, they enable the chylomicron to move in an aqueous environment without exposing the lipids to water. Chylomicrons leave the absorptive cells via exocytosis. Chylomicrons enter the lymphatic vessels, and then enter the blood in the subclavian vein.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1138" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1138" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_34_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4820" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;34.18.&nbsp; Lipids are digested and absorbed in the small intestine." width="500" height="410" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1-300x246.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1-768x631.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1-65x53.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1-225x185.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_34_03_03-1024x841-1-350x287.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1138">Figure 15.18.&nbsp;<br />Lipids are digested and absorbed in the small intestine.</div></div> <div id="m44742-fig-ch34_03_03" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;34.18.&nbsp;"><div class="title"></div> </div> <div class="section" title="Vitamins"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idp73324368"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Vitamins</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idm9315360"></span>Vitamins can be either water-soluble or lipid-soluble.

The undigested food material enters the colon, where most of the water is reabsorbed. Recall that the colon is also home to the microflora called “intestinal flora” that aid in the digestion process. The semi-solid waste is moved through the colon by peristaltic movements of the muscle and is stored in the rectum. As the rectum expands in response to storage of fecal matter, it triggers the neural signals required to set up the urge to eliminate. The solid waste is eliminated through the anus using peristaltic movements of the rectum.</p> <div class="section" title="Common Problems with Elimination"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idm30796400"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Common Problems with Elimination</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp90908560"></span>Diarrhea and constipation are some of the most common health concerns that affect digestion. Constipation is a condition where the feces are hardened because of excess water removal in the colon. In contrast, if enough water is not removed from the feces, it results in diarrhea. Many bacteria, including the ones that cause cholera, affect the proteins involved in water reabsorption in the colon and result in excessive diarrhea.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Emesis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44742-fs-idp29667520"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Emesis</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44742-fs-idp41958016"></span>Emesis, or vomiting, is elimination of food by forceful expulsion through the mouth. It is often in response to an irritant that affects the digestive tract, including but not limited to viruses, bacteria, emotions, sights, and food poisoning. This forceful expulsion of the food is due to the strong contractions produced by the stomach muscles. The process of emesis is regulated by the medulla.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Animal diet should be balanced and meet the needs of the body. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the primary components of food. Some essential nutrients are required for cellular function but cannot be produced by the animal body. These include vitamins, minerals, some fatty acids, and some amino acids. Food intake in more than necessary amounts is stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle cells, and in fat cells. Excess adipose storage can lead to obesity and serious health problems. ATP is the energy currency of the cell and is obtained from the metabolic pathways. Excess carbohydrates and energy are stored as glycogen in the body.</p> <div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44742-fs-idm42106064" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><ol><li>Where does the majority of protein digestion take place? <ol><li>stomach</li> <li>duodenum</li> <li>mouth</li> <li>jejunum</li> </ol> </li> <li>Lipases are enzymes that break down ________. <ol><li>disaccharides</li> <li>lipids</li> <li>proteins</li> <li>cellulose</li> </ol> </li> <li>Explain why some dietary lipid is a necessary part of a balanced diet.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc free-response"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44742-fs-idp167427680" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div id="m44742-fs-idp16666992" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>Lipids add flavor to food and promote a sense of satiety or fullness.

The first phase of ingestion, called the <span id="m44744-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720163"></span><strong>cephalic phas</strong>, is controlled by the neural response to the stimulus provided by food. All aspects—such as sight, sense, and smell—trigger the neural responses resulting in salivation and secretion of gastric juices. The gastric and salivary secretion in the cephalic phase can also take place due to the thought of food. Right now, if you think about a piece of chocolate or a crispy potato chip, the increase in salivation is a cephalic phase response to the thought. The central nervous system prepares the stomach to receive food.</p> <p><span id="m44744-fs-idp71992480"></span>The <span id="m44744-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1696872"></span><strong>gastric phase</strong><a id="id771151" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> begins once the food arrives in the stomach. It builds on the stimulation provided during the cephalic phase. Gastric acids and enzymes process the ingested materials. The gastric phase is stimulated by (1) distension of the stomach, (2) a decrease in the pH of the gastric contents, and (3) the presence of undigested material. This phase consists of local, hormonal, and neural responses.

The visual system is processing what is seen on the page; the motor system controls the turn of the pages (or click of the mouse); the prefrontal cortex maintains attention. Even fundamental functions, like breathing and regulation of body temperature, are controlled by the nervous system. A nervous system is an organism’s control center: it processes sensory information from outside (and inside) the body and controls all behaviors—from eating to sleeping to finding a mate.</p><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Some organisms, like sea sponges, lack a true nervous system. Others, like jellyfish, lack a true brain and instead have a system of separate but connected nerve cells (neurons) called a “nerve net.” Echinoderms such as sea stars have nerve cells that are bundled into fibers called nerves. Flatworms of the phylum Platyhelminthes have both a central nervous system (CNS), made up of a small “brain” and two nerve cords, and a peripheral nervous system (PNS) containing a system of nerves that extend throughout the body. The insect nervous system is more complex but also fairly decentralized. It contains a brain, ventral nerve cord, and ganglia (clusters of connected neurons). These ganglia can control movements and behaviors without input from the brain. Octopi may have the most complicated of invertebrate nervous systems—they have neurons that are organized in specialized lobes and eyes that are structurally similar to vertebrate species.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1145" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4832" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_01_01" width="500" height="470" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1-300x282.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1-768x722.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1-65x61.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1-225x212.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_35_01_01-1024x963-1-350x329.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1145">Figure 16.2.&nbsp; Nervous systems vary in structure and complexity.

In addition to a brain, (d) arthropods have clusters of nerve cell bodies, called peripheral ganglia, located along the ventral nerve cord.

While there is great diversity among different vertebrate nervous systems, they all share a basic structure: a CNS that contains a brain and spinal cord and a PNS made up of peripheral sensory and motor nerves. One interesting difference between the nervous systems of invertebrates and vertebrates is that the nerve cords of many invertebrates are located ventrally whereas the vertebrate spinal cords are located dorsally. There is debate among evolutionary biologists as to whether these different nervous system plans evolved separately or whether the invertebrate body plan arrangement somehow “flipped” during the evolution of vertebrates.</p> <div id="m44747-fs-idm51063712" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44747-fs-idp31101408"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/vertebrate_evol.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idp57227664"></span>Watch <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vertebrate_evol" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/vertebrate_evol">this video</a> of biologist Mark Kirschner discussing the “flipping” phenomenon of vertebrate evolution.</p> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idm2940400"></span>The nervous system is made up of <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1382818"></span><strong>neurons</strong>, specialized cells that can receive and transmit chemical or electrical signals, and <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1382822"></span><strong>glia</strong>, cells that provide support functions for the neurons by playing an information processing role that is complementary to neurons.

This number compares to 75 million in the mouse and 300 million in the octopus. A human brain contains around 86 billion neurons. Despite these very different numbers, the nervous systems of these animals control many of the same behaviors—from basic reflexes to more complicated behaviors like finding food and courting mates. The ability of neurons to communicate with each other as well as with other types of cells underlies all of these behaviors.</p> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idp80925296"></span>Most neurons share the same cellular components.

Neurons also contain unique structures, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1147" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-1-neurons-and-glial-cells/#attachment_1147">Figure 16.3</a> for receiving and sending the electrical signals that make neuronal communication possible. <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1453731"></span><strong>Dendrites</strong> are tree-like structures that extend away from the cell body to receive messages from other neurons at specialized junctions called <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1453736"></span><strong>synapses</strong>. Although some neurons do not have any dendrites, some types of neurons have multiple dendrites. Dendrites can have small protrusions called dendritic spines, which further increase surface area for possible synaptic connections.</p> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idm14255728"></span>Once a signal is received by the dendrite, it then travels passively to the cell body. The cell body contains a specialized structure, the <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1482174"></span><strong>axon hillock</strong> that integrates signals from multiple synapses and serves as a junction between the cell body and an <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1482178"></span><strong>axon</strong>. An axon is a tube-like structure that propagates the integrated signal to specialized endings called <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1482183"></span><strong>axon terminals</strong>. These terminals in turn synapse on other neurons, muscle, or target organs. Chemicals released at axon terminals allow signals to be communicated to these other cells. Neurons usually have one or two axons, but some neurons, like amacrine cells in the retina, do not contain any axons. Some axons are covered with <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1482189"></span><strong>myelin</strong>, which acts as an insulator to minimize dissipation of the electrical signal as it travels down the axon, greatly increasing the speed on conduction. This insulation is important as the axon from a human motor neuron can be as long as a meter—from the base of the spine to the toes. The myelin sheath is not actually part of the neuron. Myelin is produced by glial cells. Along the axon there are periodic gaps in the myelin sheath. These gaps are called <span id="m44747-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1482197"></span><strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong> and are sites where the signal is “recharged” as it travels along the axon.</p> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idp114206336"></span>It is important to note that a single neuron does not act alone—neuronal communication depends on the connections that neurons make with one another (as well as with other cells, like muscle cells). Dendrites from a single neuron may receive synaptic contact from many other neurons. For example, dendrites from a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum are thought to receive contact from as many as 200,000 other neurons.</p> <div id="m44747-fs-idp48683952" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1147" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4834" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1.png" alt="Figure_35_01_02" width="500" height="336" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1-300x201.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1-768x515.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1-65x44.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1-225x151.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_02-1024x687-1-350x235.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1147">Figure 16.3.&nbsp; Neurons contain organelles common to many other cells, such as a nucleus and mitochondria.

Unipolar neurons have only one structure that extends away from the soma. These neurons are not found in vertebrates but are found in insects where they stimulate muscles or glands. A bipolar neuron has one axon and one dendrite extending from the soma. An example of a bipolar neuron is a retinal bipolar cell, which receives signals from photoreceptor cells that are sensitive to light and transmits these signals to ganglion cells that carry the signal to the brain. Multipolar neurons are the most common type of neuron. Each multipolar neuron contains one axon and multiple dendrites. Multipolar neurons can be found in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). An example of a multipolar neuron is a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum, which has many branching dendrites but only one axon. Pseudounipolar cells share characteristics with both unipolar and bipolar cells. A pseudounipolar cell has a single process that extends from the soma, like a unipolar cell, but this process later branches into two distinct structures, like a bipolar cell. Most sensory neurons are pseudounipolar and have an axon that branches into two extensions: one connected to dendrites that receive sensory information and another that transmits this information to the spinal cord.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1149" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4836" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_01_04" width="600" height="322" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1-300x161.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1-768x413.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1-65x35.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1-225x121.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_04-1024x550-1-350x188.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1149">Figure 16.5.&nbsp; Neurons are broadly divided into four main types based on the number and placement of axons: (1) unipolar, (2) bipolar, (3) multipolar, and (4) pseudounipolar.</div></div> <div id="m44747-fs-idp128114784" class="note everyday"><div class="title"><div class="body"><h2 class="title">Neurogenesis</h2> <p>At one time, scientists believed that people were born with all the neurons they would ever have. Research performed during the last few decades indicates that neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons, continues into adulthood. Neurogenesis was first discovered in songbirds that produce new neurons while learning songs. For mammals, new neurons also play an important role in learning: about 1000 new neurons develop in the hippocampus (a brain structure involved in learning and memory) each day. While most of the new neurons will die, researchers found that an increase in the number of surviving new neurons in the hippocampus correlated with how well rats learned a new task. Interestingly, both exercise and some antidepressant medications also promote neurogenesis in the hippocampus. Stress has the opposite effect. While neurogenesis is quite limited compared to regeneration in other tissues, research in this area may lead to new treatments for disorders such as Alzheimer’s, stroke, and epilepsy.</p> <p><span id="m44747-fs-idp144832192"></span>How do scientists identify new neurons? A researcher can inject a compound called bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) into the brain of an animal. While all cells will be exposed to BrdU, BrdU will only be incorporated into the DNA of newly generated cells that are in S phase. A technique called immunohistochemistry can be used to attach a fluorescent label to the incorporated BrdU, and a researcher can use fluorescent microscopy to visualize the presence of BrdU, and thus new neurons, in brain tissue. Figure 16.6 is a micrograph which shows fluorescently labeled neurons in the hippocampus of a rat.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1150" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_01_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4837" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05.jpg" alt="Figure_35_01_05" width="450" height="357" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05-300x238.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05-65x51.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05-225x178.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_01_05-350x277.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1150">Figure 16.6.&nbsp; This micrograph shows fluorescently labeled new neurons in a rat hippocampus.

While humans use words and body language to communicate, neurons use electrical and chemical signals. Just like a person in a committee, one neuron usually receives and synthesizes messages from multiple other neurons before “making the decision” to send the message on to other neurons.</p> <div class="section" title="Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44748-fs-idm306684336"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm42661904"></span>For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge.</p> <div class="section" title="Neuronal Charged Membranes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44748-fs-idm92021888"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Neuronal Charged Membranes</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm247384272"></span>The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 16.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell.

This voltage is called the resting membrane potential; it is caused by differences in the concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. If the membrane were equally permeable to all ions, each type of ion would flow across the membrane and the system would reach equilibrium. Because ions cannot simply cross the membrane at will, there are different concentrations of several ions inside and outside the cell, as shown in <a class="xref target-table" title="Table&nbsp;35.1.&nbsp;The resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell." href="#m44748-tab-ch35_02_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#m44748-tab-ch35_02_01">Table 16.1</a>. The difference in the number of positively charged potassium ions (K<sup>+</sup>) inside and outside the cell dominates the resting membrane potential (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.10.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1156" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1156">Figure 16.10</a>). When the membrane is at rest, K<sup>+</sup> ions accumulate inside the cell due to a net movement with the concentration gradient. The negative resting membrane potential is created and maintained by increasing the concentration of cations outside the cell (in the extracellular fluid) relative to inside the cell (in the cytoplasm). The negative charge within the cell is created by the cell membrane being more permeable to potassium ion movement than sodium ion movement. In neurons, potassium ions are maintained at high concentrations within the cell while sodium ions are maintained at high concentrations outside of the cell. The cell possesses potassium and sodium leakage channels that allow the two cations to diffuse down their concentration gradient. However, the neurons have far more potassium leakage channels than sodium leakage channels. Therefore, potassium diffuses out of the cell at a much faster rate than sodium leaks in. Because more cations are leaving the cell than are entering, this causes the interior of the cell to be negatively charged relative to the outside of the cell. The actions of the sodium potassium pump help to maintain the resting potential, once established. Recall that sodium potassium pumps brings two K<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell while removing three Na<sup>+</sup> ions per ATP consumed. As more cations are expelled from the cell than taken in, the inside of the cell remains negatively charged relative to the extracellular fluid. It should be noted that calcium ions (Cl<sup>–</sup>) tend to accumulate outside of the cell because they are repelled by negatively-charged proteins within the cytoplasm.</p> <div id="m44748-tab-ch35_02_01" class="table"><table cellpadding="0" style="border-spacing: 0px;"><caption><span class="cnx-gentext-caption cnx-gentext-t">Table 16</span><span class="cnx-gentext-caption cnx-gentext-n">.1. </span><span class="table-caption caption">The resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations inside and outside the cell.</span></caption> <thead valign="bottom"><tr><th colspan="4">Ion Concentration Inside and Outside Neurons</th> </tr> <tr><th>Ion</th> <th>Extracellular concentration (mM)</th> <th>Intracellular concentration (mM)</th> <th>Ratio outside/inside</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody valign="top"><tr><td>Na<sup>+</sup></td> <td>145</td> <td>12</td> <td>12</td> </tr> <tr><td>K+</td> <td>4</td> <td>155</td> <td>0.026</td> </tr> <tr><td>Cl<sup>−</sup></td> <td>120</td> <td>4</td> <td>30</td> </tr> <tr><td>Organic anions (A−)</td> <td>—</td> <td>100</td> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <div id="m44748-fig-ch35_02_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.10.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1156" style="width: 423px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4845" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_02-723x1024-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;35.10.&nbsp; The (a) resting membrane potential is a result of different concentrations of Na+ and K+ ions inside and outside the cell.

Transmission of a signal between neurons is generally carried by a chemical called a neurotransmitter. Transmission of a signal within a neuron (from dendrite to axon terminal) is carried by a brief reversal of the resting membrane potential called an <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1709141"></span><strong>action potential</strong>. When neurotransmitter molecules bind to receptors located on a neuron’s dendrites, ion channels open. At excitatory synapses, this opening allows positive ions to enter the neuron and results in <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1709146"></span><strong>depolarization</strong> of the membrane—a decrease in the difference in voltage between the inside and outside of the neuron. A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron depolarizes the target neuron to its threshold potential (-55 mV). Na<sup>+</sup> channels in the axon hillock open, allowing positive ions to enter the cell (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.10.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1156" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1156">Figure 16.10</a> and <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.11.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1157" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1157">Figure 16.11</a>). Once the sodium channels open, the neuron completely depolarizes to a membrane potential of about +40 mV. Action potentials are considered an “all-or nothing” event, in that, once the threshold potential is reached, the neuron always completely depolarizes. Once depolarization is complete, the cell must now “reset” its membrane voltage back to the resting potential. To accomplish this, the Na<sup>+</sup> channels close and cannot be opened. This begins the neuron’s <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1709176"></span><strong>refractory period</strong>, in which it cannot produce another action potential because its sodium channels will not open. At the same time, voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels open, allowing K<sup>+</sup> to leave the cell. As K<sup>+</sup> ions leave the cell, the membrane potential once again becomes negative. The diffusion of K<sup>+</sup> out of the cell actually <strong><span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1709196"></span>hyperpolarizes</strong> the cell, in that the membrane potential becomes more negative than the cell’s normal resting potential. At this point, the sodium channels will return to their resting state, meaning they are ready to open again if the membrane potential again exceeds the threshold potential. Eventually the extra K<sup>+</sup> ions diffuse out of the cell through the potassium leakage channels, bringing the cell from its hyperpolarized state, back to its resting membrane potential.</p> <div id="m44748-fs-idm183942256" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1157" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1157" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_03.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_03.png"><img class="wp-image-4846" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03.png" alt="Figure_35_02_03" width="400" height="299" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03.png 469w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03-300x225.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03-65x49.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03-225x168.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_03-350x262.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1157">Figure 16.11.&nbsp; The formation of an action potential can be divided into five steps: (1) A stimulus from a sensory cell or another neuron causes the target cell to depolarize toward the threshold potential.

The speed of conduction of an action potential along an axon is influenced by both the diameter of the axon and the axon’s resistance to current leak. Myelin acts as an insulator that prevents current from leaving the axon; this increases the speed of action potential conduction. In demyelinating diseases like multiple sclerosis, action potential conduction slows because current leaks from previously insulated axon areas. The nodes of Ranvier, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.13.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1160" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1160">Figure 16.13</a> are gaps in the myelin sheath along the axon. These unmyelinated spaces are about one micrometer long and contain voltage gated Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels. Flow of ions through these channels, particularly the Na<sup>+</sup> channels, regenerates the action potential over and over again along the axon.

The neuron transmitting the signal is called the presynaptic neuron, and the neuron receiving the signal is called the postsynaptic neuron.

For example, when acetylcholine is released at the synapse between a nerve and muscle (called the neuromuscular junction) by a presynaptic neuron, it causes postsynaptic Na<sup>+</sup> channels to open. Na<sup>+</sup> enters the postsynaptic cell and causes the postsynaptic membrane to depolarize. This depolarization is called an <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1734638"></span><strong>excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)</strong> and makes the postsynaptic neuron more likely to fire an action potential. Release of neurotransmitter at inhibitory synapses causes <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1734643"></span><strong>inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs)</strong>, a hyperpolarization of the presynaptic membrane. For example, when the neurotransmitter GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released from a presynaptic neuron, it binds to and opens Cl<sup>–</sup> channels.

This can be accomplished in three ways: the neurotransmitter can diffuse away from the synaptic cleft, it can be degraded by enzymes in the synaptic cleft, or it can be recycled (sometimes called reuptake) by the presynaptic neuron. Several drugs act at this step of neurotransmission. For example, some drugs that are given to Alzheimer’s patients work by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, the enzyme that degrades acetylcholine. This inhibition of the enzyme essentially increases neurotransmission at synapses that release acetylcholine. Once released, the acetylcholine stays in the cleft and can continually bind and unbind to postsynaptic receptors.</p> <div id="m44748-tab-ch35_02_02" class="table"><table cellpadding="0" style="border-spacing: 0px;"><caption><span class="cnx-gentext-caption cnx-gentext-t">Table </span><span class="cnx-gentext-caption cnx-gentext-n">16.2.Neurotransmitter Function and Location </span></caption> <thead valign="bottom"><tr><th>Neurotransmitter</th> <th>Example</th> <th>Location</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody valign="top"><tr><td>Acetylcholine</td> <td>—</td> <td>CNS and/or PNS</td> </tr> <tr><td>Biogenic amine</td> <td>Dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine</td> <td>CNS and/or PNS</td> </tr> <tr><td>Amino acid</td> <td>Glycine, glutamate, aspartate, gamma aminobutyric acid</td> <td>CNS</td> </tr> <tr><td>Neuropeptide</td> <td>Substance P, endorphins</td> <td>CNS and/or PNS</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Electrical Synapse"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44748-fs-idm148735952"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Electrical Synapse</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm110780000"></span>While electrical synapses are fewer in number than chemical synapses, they are found in all nervous systems and play important and unique roles. The mode of neurotransmission in electrical synapses is quite different from that in chemical synapses. In an electrical synapse, the presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes are very close together and are actually physically connected by channel proteins forming gap junctions. Gap junctions allow current to pass directly from one cell to the next. In addition to the ions that carry this current, other molecules, such as ATP, can diffuse through the large gap junction pores.</p> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm19383344"></span>There are key differences between chemical and electrical synapses. Because chemical synapses depend on the release of neurotransmitter molecules from synaptic vesicles to pass on their signal, there is an approximately one millisecond delay between when the axon potential reaches the presynaptic terminal and when the neurotransmitter leads to opening of postsynaptic ion channels. Additionally, this signaling is unidirectional. Signaling in electrical synapses, in contrast, is virtually instantaneous (which is important for synapses involved in key reflexes), and some electrical synapses are bidirectional. Electrical synapses are also more reliable as they are less likely to be blocked, and they are important for synchronizing the electrical activity of a group of neurons. For example, electrical synapses in the thalamus are thought to regulate slow-wave sleep, and disruption of these synapses can cause seizures.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Signal Summation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44748-fs-idm245743248"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Signal Summation</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm98199488"></span>Sometimes a single EPSP is strong enough to induce an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron, but often multiple presynaptic inputs must create EPSPs around the same time for the postsynaptic neuron to be sufficiently depolarized to fire an action potential.

Additionally, one neuron often has inputs from many presynaptic neurons—some excitatory and some inhibitory—so IPSPs can cancel out EPSPs and vice versa. It is the net change in postsynaptic membrane voltage that determines whether the postsynaptic cell has reached its threshold of excitation needed to fire an action potential. Together, synaptic summation and the threshold for excitation act as a filter so that random “noise” in the system is not transmitted as important information.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1163" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_08.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_08.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4852" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08.jpg" alt="Figure_35_02_08" width="450" height="299" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08-300x200.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08-225x150.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_08-350x233.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1163">Figure 16.16.&nbsp; A single neuron can receive both excitatory and inhibitory inputs from multiple neurons, resulting in local membrane depolarization (EPSP input) and hyperpolarization (IPSP input).

The disease begins with muscle weakening and lack of coordination and eventually destroys the neurons that control speech, breathing, and swallowing; in the end, the disease can lead to paralysis. At that point, patients require assistance from machines to be able to breathe and to communicate. Several special technologies have been developed to allow “locked-in” patients to communicate with the rest of the world. One technology, for example, allows patients to type out sentences by twitching their cheek. These sentences can then be read aloud by a computer.</p> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm8955264"></span>A relatively new line of research for helping paralyzed patients, including those with ALS, to communicate and retain a degree of self-sufficiency is called brain-computer interface (BCI) technology and is illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.17.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1164" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1164">Figure 16.17</a>. This technology sounds like something out of science fiction: it allows paralyzed patients to control a computer using only their thoughts. There are several forms of BCI. Some forms use EEG recordings from electrodes taped onto the skull. These recordings contain information from large populations of neurons that can be decoded by a computer. Other forms of BCI require the implantation of an array of electrodes smaller than a postage stamp in the arm and hand area of the motor cortex. This form of BCI, while more invasive, is very powerful as each electrode can record actual action potentials from one or more neurons. These signals are then sent to a computer, which has been trained to decode the signal and feed it to a tool—such as a cursor on a computer screen. This means that a patient with ALS can use e-mail, read the Internet, and communicate with others by thinking of moving his or her hand or arm (even though the paralyzed patient cannot make that bodily movement). Recent advances have allowed a paralyzed locked-in patient who suffered a stroke 15 years ago to control a robotic arm and even to feed herself coffee using BCI technology.</p> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm206604448"></span>Despite the amazing advancements in BCI technology, it also has limitations.

They can be weakened or strengthened. They can be broken, and new synapses can be made. Synaptic plasticity allows for these changes, which are all needed for a functioning nervous system. In fact, synaptic plasticity is the basis of learning and memory. Two processes in particular, long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) are important forms of synaptic plasticity that occur in synapses in the hippocampus, a brain region that is involved in storing memories.</p> <div class="section" title="Long-term Potentiation (LTP)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44748-fs-idm255135008"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Long-term Potentiation (LTP)</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44748-fs-idm118440240"></span> <span id="m44748-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1716939"></span><strong>Long-term potentiation (LTP)</strong> is a persistent strengthening of a synaptic connection. LTP is based on the Hebbian principle: cells that fire together wire together. There are various mechanisms, none fully understood, behind the synaptic strengthening seen with LTP. One known mechanism involves a type of postsynaptic glutamate receptor, called NMDA (N-Methyl-D-aspartate) receptors, shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.18.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1166" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1166">Figure 16.18</a>. These receptors are normally blocked by magnesium ions; however, when the postsynaptic neuron is depolarized by multiple presynaptic inputs in quick succession (either from one neuron or multiple neurons), the magnesium ions are forced out allowing Ca ions to pass into the postsynaptic cell. Next, Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions entering the cell initiate a signaling cascade that causes a different type of glutamate receptor, called AMPA (α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors, to be inserted into the postsynaptic membrane, since activated AMPA receptors allow positive ions to enter the cell. So, the next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic membrane, it will have a larger excitatory effect (EPSP) on the postsynaptic cell because the binding of glutamate to these AMPA receptors will allow more positive ions into the cell. The insertion of additional AMPA receptors strengthens the synapse and means that the postsynaptic neuron is more likely to fire in response to presynaptic neurotransmitter release.

In this situation, calcium that enters through NMDA receptors initiates a different signaling cascade, which results in the removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic membrane, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.18.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1166" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-2-how-neurons-communicate/#attachment_1166">Figure 16.18</a>. The decrease in AMPA receptors in the membrane makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron. While it may seem counterintuitive, LTD may be just as important for learning and memory as LTP. The weakening and pruning of unused synapses allows for unimportant connections to be lost and makes the synapses that have undergone LTP that much stronger by comparison.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1166" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_10.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_02_10.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4855" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_02_10" width="600" height="516" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1-300x258.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1-768x660.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1-65x56.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1-225x193.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_02_10-1024x880-1-350x301.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1166">Figure 16.18.&nbsp; Calcium entry through postsynaptic NMDA receptors can initiate two different forms of synaptic plasticity: long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). LTP arises when a single synapse is repeatedly stimulated. This stimulation causes a calcium- and CaMKII-dependent cellular cascade, which results in the insertion of more AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. The next time glutamate is released from the presynaptic cell, it will bind to both NMDA and the newly inserted AMPA receptors, thus depolarizing the membrane more efficiently. LTD occurs when few glutamate molecules bind to NMDA receptors at a synapse (due to a low firing rate of the presynaptic neuron). The calcium that does flow through NMDA receptors initiates a different calcineurin and protein phosphatase 1-dependent cascade, which results in the endocytosis of AMPA receptors. This makes the postsynaptic neuron less responsive to glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron.</div></div> <div id="m44748-fig-ch35_02_10" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.18.&nbsp;"><div class="title"><div class="section module" title="35.5.&nbsp;Nervous System Disorders" xml:lang="en"><div class="section" title="Other Neurological Disorders"><h2 class="section" title="Stroke">Summary</h2> <p>Neurons have charged membranes because there are different concentrations of ions inside and outside of the cell. Voltage-gated ion channels control the movement of ions into and out of a neuron. When a neuronal membrane is depolarized to at least the threshold of excitation, an action potential is fired. The action potential is then propagated along a myelinated axon to the axon terminals. In a chemical synapse, the action potential causes release of neurotransmitter molecules into the synaptic cleft. Through binding to postsynaptic receptors, the neurotransmitter can cause excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic potentials by depolarizing or hyperpolarizing, respectively, the postsynaptic membrane. In electrical synapses, the action potential is directly communicated to the postsynaptic cell through gap junctions—large channel proteins that connect the pre-and postsynaptic membranes. Synapses are not static structures and can be strengthened and weakened. Two mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are long-term potentiation and long-term depression.</p> <div class="section" title="Stroke"><div class="section empty"><div class="section" title="Stroke"><div class="section" title="Stroke"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Potassium channel blockers, such as amiodarone and procainamide, which are used to treat abnormal electrical activity in the heart, called cardiac dysrhythmia, impede the movement of K+ through voltage-gated K+ channels.

The outermost layer is the <span id="m44749-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1721567"></span><strong>dura mater</strong> (Latin for “hard mother”). As the Latin suggests, the primary function for this thick layer is to protect the brain and spinal cord.

Although there are some brain functions that are localized more to one hemisphere than the other, the functions of the two hemispheres are largely redundant. In fact, sometimes (very rarely) an entire hemisphere is removed to treat severe epilepsy. While patients do suffer some deficits following the surgery, they can have surprisingly few problems, especially when the surgery is performed on children who have very immature nervous systems.</p> <div id="m44749-fig-ch35_03_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.20.&nbsp;"><table class="cnx-figure-horizontal"><tbody><tr><td><div class="informalfigure"><p><span id="m44749-fs-idm64447504"></span><span class="inlinemediaobject"><span id="m44749-fs-idm92701104"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_02a.jpg" alt="Illustration shows coronal (front) and sagittal (side) sections of a human brain.

This causes a condition called split-brain, which gives insights into unique functions of the two hemispheres. For example, when an object is presented to patients’ left visual field, they may be unable to verbally name the object (and may claim to not have seen an object at all). This is because the visual input from the left visual field crosses and enters the right hemisphere and cannot then signal to the speech center, which generally is found in the left side of the brain. Remarkably, if a split-brain patient is asked to pick up a specific object out of a group of objects with the left hand, the patient will be able to do so but will still be unable to vocally identify it.</p> <div id="m44749-fs-idm242368336" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44749-fs-idm100971488"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/split-brain.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44749-fs-idm88033600"></span>See <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/split-brain">this website</a> to learn more about split-brain patients and to play a game where you can model the split-brain experiments yourself.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44749-fs-idp4869840"></span>Each cortical hemisphere contains regions called lobes that are involved in different functions. Scientists use various techniques to determine what brain areas are involved in different functions: they examine patients who have had injuries or diseases that affect specific areas and see how those areas are related to functional deficits. They also conduct animal studies where they stimulate brain areas and see if there are any behavioral changes. They use a technique called transmagnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily deactivate specific parts of the cortex using strong magnets placed outside the head; and they use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at changes in oxygenated blood flow in particular brain regions that correlate with specific behavioral tasks. These techniques, and others, have given great insight into the functions of different brain regions but have also showed that any given brain area can be involved in more than one behavior or process, and any given behavior or process generally involves neurons in multiple brain areas. That being said, each hemisphere of the mammalian cerebral cortex can be broken down into four functionally and spatially defined lobes: frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital. Figure 16.21 illustrates these four lobes of the human cerebral cortex.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1171" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_03.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_03.png"><img class="wp-image-4862" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03.png" alt="Figure_35_03_03" width="450" height="355" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03.png 469w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03-300x237.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03-65x51.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03-225x178.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_03-350x276.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1171">Figure 16.21.&nbsp; The human cerebral cortex includes the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes.</div></div> <div id="m44749-fig-ch35_03_03" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.21.&nbsp;"><div class="title"></div> <p><span id="m44749-fs-idm71945584"></span>The <span id="m44749-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1715443"></span><strong>frontal lobe</strong> is located at the front of the brain, over the eyes.

Areas within the motor cortex map to different muscle groups, and there is some organization to this map, as shown in Figure 16.22. For example, the neurons that control movement of the fingers are next to the neurons that control movement of the hand.

An entire alligator’s brain, for example, would fill about one and a half teaspoons. This increase in brain to body size ratio is especially pronounced in apes, whales, and dolphins. While this increase in overall brain size doubtlessly played a role in the evolution of complex behaviors unique to mammals, it does not tell the whole story. Scientists have found a relationship between the relatively high surface area of the cortex and the intelligence and complex social behaviors exhibited by some mammals. This increased surface area is due, in part, to increased folding of the cortical sheet (more sulci and gyri). For example, a rat cortex is very smooth with very few sulci and gyri. Cat and sheep cortices have more sulci and gyri. Chimps, humans, and dolphins have even more.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1173" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1173" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4864" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_03_05" width="600" height="252" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1-300x126.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1-768x323.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1-65x27.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1-225x94.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_05-1024x430-1-350x147.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1173">Figure 16.23.&nbsp; Mammals have larger brain-to-body ratios than other vertebrates.

Damage to the basal ganglia, as in Parkinson’s disease, leads to motor impairments like a shuffling gait when walking. The basal ganglia also regulate motivation.

The spinal cord is a thick bundle of nerve tissue that carries information about the body to the brain and from the brain to the body. The spinal cord is contained within the bones of the vertebrate column but is able to communicate signals to and from the body through its connections with spinal nerves (part of the peripheral nervous system). A cross-section of the spinal cord looks like a white oval containing a gray butterfly-shape, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.25.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1175" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-3-the-central-nervous-system/#attachment_1175">Figure 16.25</a>. Myelinated axons make up the “white matter” and neuron and glial cell bodies make up the “gray matter.” Gray matter is also composed of interneurons, which connect two neurons each located in different parts of the body. Axons and cell bodies in the dorsal (facing the back of the animal) spinal cord convey mostly sensory information from the body to the brain. Axons and cell bodies in the ventral (facing the front of the animal) spinal cord primarily transmit signals controlling movement from the brain to the body.</p> <p><span id="m44749-fs-idm268132256"></span>The spinal cord also controls motor reflexes. These reflexes are quick, unconscious movements—like automatically removing a hand from a hot object. Reflexes are so fast because they involve local synaptic connections. For example, the knee reflex that a doctor tests during a routine physical is controlled by a single synapse between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron. While a reflex may only require the involvement of one or two synapses, synapses with interneurons in the spinal column transmit information to the brain to convey what happened (the knee jerked, or the hand was hot).</p> <p><span id="m44749-fs-idm39157584"></span>In the United States, there around 10,000 spinal cord injuries each year. Because the spinal cord is the information superhighway connecting the brain with the body, damage to the spinal cord can lead to paralysis. The extent of the paralysis depends on the location of the injury along the spinal cord and whether the spinal cord was completely severed. For example, if the spinal cord is damaged at the level of the neck, it can cause paralysis from the neck down, whereas damage to the spinal column further down may limit paralysis to the legs. Spinal cord injuries are notoriously difficult to treat because spinal nerves do not regenerate, although ongoing research suggests that stem cell transplants may be able to act as a bridge to reconnect severed nerves. Researchers are also looking at ways to prevent the inflammation that worsens nerve damage after injury. One such treatment is to pump the body with cold saline to induce hypothermia. This cooling can prevent swelling and other processes that are thought to worsen spinal cord injuries.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1175" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1175" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_03_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4866" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07.jpg" alt="Figure_35_03_07" width="400" height="225" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07-300x169.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07-65x37.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07-225x127.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_03_07-350x197.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1175">Figure 16.25.&nbsp; A cross-section of the spinal cord shows gray matter (containing cell bodies and interneurons) and white matter (containing axons).</div></div> <div id="m44749-fig-ch35_03_07" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.25.&nbsp;"><div class="title"><div class="section module" title="35.5.&nbsp;Nervous System Disorders" xml:lang="en"><div class="section" title="Other Neurological Disorders"><h2 class="section" title="Stroke">Summary</h2> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><p><span id="m44749-fs-idm78292048"></span>The vertebrate central nervous system contains the brain and the spinal cord, which are covered and protected by three meninges.

The autonomic nervous system controls these organs largely without conscious control; it can continuously monitor the conditions of these different systems and implement changes as needed. Signaling to the target tissue usually involves two synapses: a preganglionic neuron (originating in the CNS) synapses to a neuron in a ganglion that, in turn, synapses on the target organ, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.26.&nbsp;" href="#m44751-fig-ch35_04_01" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-4-the-peripheral-nervous-system/#m44751-fig-ch35_04_01">Figure 16.26</a>.

As anyone who has ever felt a rush before a big test, speech, or athletic event can attest, the effects of the sympathetic nervous system are quite pervasive. This is both because one preganglionic neuron synapses on multiple postganglionic neurons, amplifying the effect of the original synapse, and because the adrenal gland also releases norepinephrine (and the closely related hormone epinephrine) into the blood stream. The physiological effects of this norepinephrine release include dilating the trachea and bronchi (making it easier for the animal to breathe), increasing heart rate, and moving blood from the skin to the heart, muscles, and brain (so the animal can think and run). The strength and speed of the sympathetic response helps an organism avoid danger, and scientists have found evidence that it may also increase LTP—allowing the animal to remember the dangerous situation and avoid it in the future.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Parasympathetic Nervous System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44751-fs-idp38567296"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Parasympathetic Nervous System</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44751-fs-idp17004208"></span>While the sympathetic nervous system is activated in stressful situations, the <span id="m44751-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1716368"></span><strong>parasympathetic nervous system</strong> allows an animal to “rest and digest.” One way to remember this is to think that during a restful situation like a picnic, the parasympathetic nervous system is in control (“picnic” and “parasympathetic” both start with “p”).

Motor neurons transmit messages about desired movement from the CNS to the muscles to make them contract. Without its sensory-somatic nervous system, an animal would be unable to process any information about its environment (what it sees, feels, hears, and so on) and could not control motor movements. Unlike the autonomic nervous system, which has two synapses between the CNS and the target organ, sensory and motor neurons have only one synapse—one ending of the neuron is at the organ and the other directly contacts a CNS neuron. Acetylcholine is the main neurotransmitter released at these synapses.</p> <p><span id="m44751-fs-idp36837024"></span>Humans have 12 <span id="m44751-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1797510"></span><strong>cranial nerves</strong>, nerves that emerge from or enter the skull (cranium), as opposed to the spinal nerves, which emerge from the vertebral column. Each cranial nerve is accorded a name, which are detailed in Figure 16.28. Some cranial nerves transmit only sensory information. For example, the olfactory nerve transmits information about smells from the nose to the brainstem. Other cranial nerves transmit almost solely motor information. For example, the oculomotor nerve controls the opening and closing of the eyelid and some eye movements. Other cranial nerves contain a mix of sensory and motor fibers.

Unfortunately, each year millions of people in the United States deal with some sort of nervous system disorder.

These diseases generally worsen over time as more and more neurons die. The symptoms of a particular neurodegenerative disease are related to where in the nervous system the death of neurons occurs. Spinocerebellar ataxia, for example, leads to neuronal death in the cerebellum. The death of these neurons causes problems in balance and walking. Neurodegenerative disorders include Huntington’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia disorders, and Parkinson’s disease. Here, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease will be discussed in more depth.</p> <div class="section" title="Alzheimer’s Disease"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idp100124336"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Alzheimer’s Disease</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm210079184"></span> <span id="m44752-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1753050"></span><strong>Alzheimer’s disease</strong> is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly. In 2012, an estimated 5.4 million Americans suffered from Alzheimer’s disease, and payments for their care are estimated at $200 billion. Roughly one in every eight people age 65 or older has the disease. Due to the aging of the baby-boomer generation, there are projected to be as many as 13 million Alzheimer’s patients in the United States in the year 2050.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm8814176"></span>Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulty planning or executing tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes. Problems smelling certain scents can also be indicative of Alzheimer’s disease and may serve as an early warning sign. Many of these symptoms are also common in people who are aging normally, so it is the severity and longevity of the symptoms that determine whether a person is suffering from Alzheimer’s.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm166963136"></span>Alzheimer’s disease was named for Alois Alzheimer, a German psychiatrist who published a report in 1911 about a woman who showed severe dementia symptoms. Along with his colleagues, he examined the woman’s brain following her death and reported the presence of abnormal clumps, which are now called amyloid plaques, along with tangled brain fibers called neurofibrillary tangles. Amyloid plaques, neurofibrillary tangles, and an overall shrinking of brain volume are commonly seen in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Loss of neurons in the hippocampus is especially severe in advanced Alzheimer’s patients. <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.30.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1181" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-5-nervous-system-disorders/#attachment_1181">Figure 16.30</a> compares a normal brain to the brain of an Alzheimer’s patient. Many research groups are examining the causes of these hallmarks of the disease.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idp12047536"></span>One form of the disease is usually caused by mutations in one of three known genes. This rare form of early onset Alzheimer’s disease affects fewer than five percent of patients with the disease and causes dementia beginning between the ages of 30 and 60. The more prevalent, late-onset form of the disease likely also has a genetic component. One particular gene, apolipoprotein E (APOE) has a variant (E4) that increases a carrier’s likelihood of getting the disease. Many other genes have been identified that might be involved in the pathology.</p> <h2>Concept in Action</h2> <div id="m44752-fs-idm81647280" class="note interactive"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44752-fs-idp36697952"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/alzheimers.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm163486320"></span>Visit <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/alzheimers" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/alzheimers">this website</a> for video links discussing genetics and Alzheimer’s disease.</p> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm92831824"></span>Unfortunately, there is no cure for Alzheimer’s disease. Current treatments focus on managing the symptoms of the disease. Because decrease in the activity of cholinergic neurons (neurons that use the neurotransmitter acetylcholine) is common in Alzheimer’s disease, several drugs used to treat the disease work by increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission, often by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft. Other clinical interventions focus on behavioral therapies like psychotherapy, sensory therapy, and cognitive exercises. Since Alzheimer’s disease appears to hijack the normal aging process, research into prevention is prevalent. Smoking, obesity, and cardiovascular problems may be risk factors for the disease, so treatments for those may also help to prevent Alzheimer’s disease. Some studies have shown that people who remain intellectually active by playing games, reading, playing musical instruments, and being socially active in later life have a reduced risk of developing the disease.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1181" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1181" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4876" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_05_01" width="500" height="223" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1-300x134.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1-768x343.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1-65x29.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1-225x100.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_01-1024x457-1-350x156.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1181">Figure 16.30.&nbsp; Compared to a normal brain (left), the brain from a patient with Alzheimer’s disease (right) shows a dramatic neurodegeneration, particularly within the ventricles and hippocampus.

It was first characterized by James Parkinson in 1817. Each year, 50,000-60,000 people in the United States are diagnosed with the disease. Parkinson’s disease causes the loss of dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra, a midbrain structure that regulates movement. Loss of these neurons causes many symptoms including tremor (shaking of fingers or a limb), slowed movement, speech changes, balance and posture problems, and rigid muscles. The combination of these symptoms often causes a characteristic slow hunched shuffling walk, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.31.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1182" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-5-nervous-system-disorders/#attachment_1182">Figure 16.31</a>. Patients with Parkinson’s disease can also exhibit psychological symptoms, such as dementia or emotional problems.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idp12408960"></span>Although some patients have a form of the disease known to be caused by a single mutation, for most patients the exact causes of Parkinson’s disease remain unknown: the disease likely results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors (similar to Alzheimer’s disease). Post-mortem analysis of brains from Parkinson’s patients shows the presence of Lewy bodies—abnormal protein clumps—in dopaminergic neurons. The prevalence of these Lewy bodies often correlates with the severity of the disease.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm180615088"></span>There is no cure for Parkinson’s disease, and treatment is focused on easing symptoms. One of the most commonly prescribed drugs for Parkinson’s is L-DOPA, which is a chemical that is converted into dopamine by neurons in the brain. This conversion increases the overall level of dopamine neurotransmission and can help compensate for the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. Other drugs work by inhibiting the enzyme that breaks down dopamine.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1182" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4877" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02.jpg" alt="Figure_35_05_02" width="450" height="474" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02-285x300.jpg 285w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02-65x68.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02-225x237.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_02-350x369.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1182">Figure 16.31.&nbsp; Parkinson’s patients often have a characteristic hunched walk.</div></div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Neurodevelopmental Disorders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm152488816"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Neurodevelopmental Disorders</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm108649040"></span>Neurodevelopmental disorders occur when the development of the nervous system is disturbed. There are several different classes of neurodevelopmental disorders. Some, like Down Syndrome, cause intellectual deficits. Others specifically affect communication, learning, or the motor system. Some disorders like autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder have complex symptoms.</p> <div class="section" title="Autism"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm182712080"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Autism</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm111060144"></span> <span id="m44752-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1760340"></span><strong>Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)</strong> is a neurodevelopmental disorder. Its severity differs from person to person. Estimates for the prevalence of the disorder have changed rapidly in the past few decades. Current estimates suggest that one in 88 children will develop the disorder. ASD is four times more prevalent in males than females.</p> <div id="m44752-fs-idm182662720" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44752-fs-idm235636464"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/autism.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm14239728"></span><a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/autism" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/autism">This video</a> discusses possible reasons why there has been a recent increase in the number of people diagnosed with autism.</p> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm209092320"></span>A characteristic symptom of ASD is impaired social skills. Children with autism may have difficulty making and maintaining eye contact and reading social cues. They also may have problems feeling empathy for others. Other symptoms of ASD include repetitive motor behaviors (such as rocking back and forth), preoccupation with specific subjects, strict adherence to certain rituals, and unusual language use. Up to 30 percent of patients with ASD develop epilepsy, and patients with some forms of the disorder (like Fragile X) also have intellectual disability. Because it is a spectrum disorder, other ASD patients are very functional and have good-to-excellent language skills. Many of these patients do not feel that they suffer from a disorder and instead think that their brains just process information differently.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm141062096"></span>Except for some well-characterized, clearly genetic forms of autism (like Fragile X and Rett’s Syndrome), the causes of ASD are largely unknown. Variants of several genes correlate with the presence of ASD, but for any given patient, many different mutations in different genes may be required for the disease to develop. At a general level, ASD is thought to be a disease of “incorrect” wiring. Accordingly, brains of some ASD patients lack the same level of synaptic pruning that occurs in non-affected people. In the 1990s, a research paper linked autism to a common vaccine given to children. This paper was retracted when it was discovered that the author falsified data, and follow-up studies showed no connection between vaccines and autism.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idp34789392"></span>Treatment for autism usually combines behavioral therapies and interventions, along with medications to treat other disorders common to people with autism (depression, anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder). Although early interventions can help mitigate the effects of the disease, there is currently no cure for ASD.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idp17558352"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm75028000"></span>Approximately three to five percent of children and adults are affected by <span id="m44752-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1713578"></span><strong>attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)</strong>. Like ASD, ADHD is more prevalent in males than females. Symptoms of the disorder include inattention (lack of focus), executive functioning difficulties, impulsivity, and hyperactivity beyond what is characteristic of the normal developmental stage. Some patients do not have the hyperactive component of symptoms and are diagnosed with a subtype of ADHD: attention deficit disorder (ADD). Many people with ADHD also show comorbitity, in that they develop secondary disorders in addition to ADHD. Examples include depression or obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;35.32.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1184" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/16-5-nervous-system-disorders/#attachment_1184">Figure 16.32</a> provides some statistics concerning comorbidity with ADHD.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm91984784"></span>The cause of ADHD is unknown, although research points to a delay and dysfunction in the development of the prefrontal cortex and disturbances in neurotransmission. According to studies of twins, the disorder has a strong genetic component. There are several candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder, but no definitive links have been discovered. Environmental factors, including exposure to certain pesticides, may also contribute to the development of ADHD in some patients. Treatment for ADHD often involves behavioral therapies and the prescription of stimulant medications, which paradoxically cause a calming effect in these patients.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1184" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_35_05_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4879" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1.jpg" alt="Figure_35_05_03" width="600" height="212" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1-300x106.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1-768x272.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1-65x23.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1-225x80.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_35_05_03-1024x362-1-350x124.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1184">Figure 16.32.&nbsp; Many people with ADHD have one or more other neurological disorders.

They diagnose and treat disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, dementia, nervous system injuries, Parkinson’s disease, sleep disorders, and multiple sclerosis. Neurologists are medical doctors who have attended college, medical school, and completed three to four years of neurology residency.</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm140554784"></span>When examining a new patient, a neurologist takes a full medical history and performs a complete physical exam. The physical exam contains specific tasks that are used to determine what areas of the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nervous system may be damaged. For example, to check whether the hypoglossal nerve is functioning correctly, the neurologist will ask the patient to move his or her tongue in different ways. If the patient does not have full control over tongue movements, then the hypoglossal nerve may be damaged or there may be a lesion in the brainstem where the cell bodies of these neurons reside (or there could be damage to the tongue muscle itself).</p> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm136195504"></span>Neurologists have other tools besides a physical exam they can use to diagnose particular problems in the nervous system. If the patient has had a seizure, for example, the neurologist can use electroencephalography (EEG), which involves taping electrodes to the scalp to record brain activity, to try to determine which brain regions are involved in the seizure. In suspected stroke patients, a neurologist can use a computerized tomography (CT) scan, which is a type of X-ray, to look for bleeding in the brain or a possible brain tumor. To treat patients with neurological problems, neurologists can prescribe medications or refer the patient to a neurosurgeon for surgery.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="m44752-fs-idm228143216" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44752-fs-idm46042928"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/neurologic_exam.png" alt="QR Code reprsenting a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm87243920"></span><a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neurologic_exam" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/neurologic_exam">This website</a> allows you to see the different tests a neurologist might use to see what regions of the nervous system may be damaged in a patient.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Mental Illnesses"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm365552"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Mental Illnesses</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm177055824"></span>Mental illnesses are nervous system disorders that result in problems with thinking, mood, or relating with other people. These disorders are severe enough to affect a person’s quality of life and often make it difficult for people to perform the routine tasks of daily living. Debilitating mental disorders plague approximately 12.5 million Americans (about 1 in 17 people) at an annual cost of more than $300 billion. There are several types of mental disorders including schizophrenia, major depression, bipolar disorder, anxiety disorders and phobias, post-traumatic stress disorders, and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), among others. The American Psychiatric Association publishes the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or DSM), which describes the symptoms required for a patient to be diagnosed with a particular mental disorder. Each newly released version of the DSM contains different symptoms and classifications as scientists learn more about these disorders, their causes, and how they relate to each other. A more detailed discussion of two mental illnesses—schizophrenia and major depression—is given below.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Schizophrenia"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm129495904"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Schizophrenia</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm220211264"></span> <span id="m44752-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1750028"></span><strong>Schizophrenia</strong> is a serious and often debilitating mental illness affecting one percent of people in the United States. Symptoms of the disease include the inability to differentiate between reality and imagination, inappropriate and unregulated emotional responses, difficulty thinking, and problems with social situations. People with schizophrenia can suffer from hallucinations and hear voices; they may also suffer from delusions. Patients also have so-called “negative” symptoms like a flattened emotional state, loss of pleasure, and loss of basic drives. Many schizophrenic patients are diagnosed in their late adolescence or early 20s. The development of schizophrenia is thought to involve malfunctioning dopaminergic neurons and may also involve problems with glutamate signaling. Treatment for the disease usually requires antipsychotic medications that work by blocking dopamine receptors and decreasing dopamine neurotransmission in the brain. This decrease in dopamine can cause Parkinson’s disease-like symptoms in some patients. While some classes of antipsychotics can be quite effective at treating the disease, they are not a cure, and most patients must remain medicated for the rest of their lives.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Depression"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm234712016"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Depression</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm21686752"></span> <span id="m44752-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1750056"></span><strong>Major depression</strong> affects approximately 6.7 percent of the adults in the United States each year and is one of the most common mental disorders. To be diagnosed with major depressive disorder, a person must have experienced a severely depressed mood lasting longer than two weeks along with other symptoms including a loss of enjoyment in activities that were previously enjoyed, changes in appetite and sleep schedules, difficulty concentrating, feelings of worthlessness, and suicidal thoughts. The exact causes of major depression are unknown and likely include both genetic and environmental risk factors. Some research supports the “classic monoamine hypothesis,” which suggests that depression is caused by a decrease in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmission. One argument against this hypothesis is the fact that some antidepressant medications cause an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin release within a few hours of beginning treatment—but clinical results of these medications are not seen until weeks later. This has led to alternative hypotheses: for example, dopamine may also be decreased in depressed patients, or it may actually be an increase in norepinephrine and serotonin that causes the disease, and antidepressants force a feedback loop that decreases this release. Treatments for depression include psychotherapy, electroconvulsive therapy, deep-brain stimulation, and prescription medications. There are several classes of antidepressant medications that work through different mechanisms. For example, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO inhibitors) block the enzyme that degrades many neurotransmitters (including dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine), resulting in increased neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) block the reuptake of serotonin into the presynaptic neuron. This blockage results in an increase in serotonin in the synaptic cleft. Other types of drugs such as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors and norepinephrine-serotonin reuptake inhibitors are also used to treat depression.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Other Neurological Disorders"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idm95986640"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Other Neurological Disorders</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm112859200"></span>There are several other neurological disorders that cannot be easily placed in the above categories.

While there are several different types of epilepsy, all are characterized by recurrent seizures. Epilepsy itself can be a symptom of a brain injury, disease, or other illness. For example, people who have intellectual disability or ASD can experience seizures, presumably because the developmental wiring malfunctions that caused their disorders also put them at risk for epilepsy. For many patients, however, the cause of their epilepsy is never identified and is likely to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Often, seizures can be controlled with anticonvulsant medications. However, for very severe cases, patients may undergo brain surgery to remove the brain area where seizures originate.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Stroke"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44752-fs-idp3211984"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Stroke</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44752-fs-idm175084336"></span>A stroke results when blood fails to reach a portion of the brain for a long enough time to cause damage. Without the oxygen supplied by blood flow, neurons in this brain region die. This neuronal death can cause many different symptoms—depending on the brain area affected— including headache, muscle weakness or paralysis, speech disturbances, sensory problems, memory loss, and confusion. Stroke is often caused by blood clots and can also be caused by the bursting of a weak blood vessel. Strokes are extremely common and are the third most common cause of death in the United States. On average one person experiences a stroke every 40 seconds in the United States. Approximately 75 percent of strokes occur in people older than 65. Risk factors for stroke include high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, and a family history of stroke. Smoking doubles the risk of stroke. Because a stroke is a medical emergency, patients with symptoms of a stroke should immediately go to the emergency room, where they can receive drugs that will dissolve any clot that may have formed. These drugs will not work if the stroke was caused by a burst blood vessel or if the stroke occurred more than three hours before arriving at the hospital. Treatment following a stroke can include blood pressure medication (to prevent future strokes) and (sometimes intense) physical therapy.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Some general themes emerge from the sampling of nervous system disorders presented above. The causes for most disorders are not fully understood—at least not for all patients—and likely involve a combination of nature (genetic mutations that become risk factors) and nurture (emotional trauma, stress, hazardous chemical exposure). Because the causes have yet to be fully determined, treatment options are often lacking and only address symptoms.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Parkinson’s disease is a caused by the degeneration of neurons that release ________. <ol><li>serotonin</li> <li>dopamine</li> <li>glutamate</li> <li>norepinephrine</li> </ol> </li> <li>________ medications are often used to treat patients with ADHD. <ol><li>Tranquilizer</li> <li>Antibiotic</li> <li>Stimulant</li> <li>Anti-seizure</li> </ol> </li> <li>Strokes are often caused by _______. <ol><li>neurodegeneration</li> <li>blood clots or burst blood vessels</li> <li>seizures</li> <li>viruses</li> </ol> </li> <li>What are the main symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease?</li> <li>What are possible treatments for patients with major depression?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>B</li> <li>Symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease include disruptive memory loss, confusion about time or place, difficulties planning or executing tasks, poor judgment, and personality changes.</li> <li>Possible treatments for patients with major depression include psychotherapy and prescription medications.

All bilaterally symmetric animals have a sensory system, and the development of any species’ sensory system has been driven by natural selection; thus, sensory systems differ among species according to the demands of their environments. The shark, unlike most fish predators, is electrosensitive—that is, sensitive to electrical fields produced by other animals in its environment.

Humans have five special senses: olfaction (smell), gustation (taste), equilibrium (balance and body position), vision, and hearing. Additionally, we possess general senses, also called somatosensation, which respond to stimuli like temperature, pain, pressure, and vibration. <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280082"></span><strong>Vestibular sensation</strong>, which is an organism’s sense of spatial orientation and balance, <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280085"></span><strong>proprioception</strong> (position of bones, joints, and muscles), and the sense of limb position that is used to track <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280090"></span><strong>kinesthesia</strong> (limb movement) are part of somatosensation. Although the sensory systems associated with these senses are very different, all share a common function: to convert a stimulus (such as light, or sound, or the position of the body) into an electrical signal in the nervous system. This process is called <strong><span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280096"></span>sensory transduction</strong>.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp111589088"></span>There are two broad types of cellular systems that perform sensory transduction. In one, a neuron works with a <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280106"></span><strong>sensory receptor</strong>, a cell, or cell process that is specialized to engage with and detect a specific stimulus. Stimulation of the sensory receptor activates the associated afferent neuron, which carries information about the stimulus to the central nervous system. In the second type of sensory transduction, a sensory nerve ending responds to a stimulus in the internal or external environment: this neuron constitutes the sensory receptor. Free nerve endings can be stimulated by several different stimuli, thus showing little receptor specificity. For example, pain receptors in your gums and teeth may be stimulated by temperature changes, chemical stimulation, or pressure.</p> <div class="section" title="Reception"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44754-fs-idp93566032" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Reception</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp166398320"></span>The first step in sensation is <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1280129"></span><strong>reception</strong></p> </div> <p>, which is the activation of sensory receptors by stimuli such as mechanical stimuli (being bent or squished, for example), chemicals, or temperature. The receptor can then respond to the stimuli. The region in space in which a given sensory receptor can respond to a stimulus, be it far away or in contact with the body, is that receptor’s <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1247278"></span><strong>receptive</strong> <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1247280"></span>field. Think for a moment about the differences in receptive fields for the different senses. For the sense of touch, a stimulus must come into contact with body. For the sense of hearing, a stimulus can be a moderate distance away (some baleen whale sounds can propagate for many kilometers). For vision, a stimulus can be very far away; for example, the visual system perceives light from stars at enormous distances.</p> <div class="section" title="Transduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44754-fs-idp44066992" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Transduction</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idm23928880"></span>The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system. This takes place at the sensory receptor, and the change in electrical potential that is produced is called the <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1247305"></span><strong>receptor potential</strong>. How is sensory input, such as pressure on the skin, changed to a receptor potential? In this example, a type of receptor called a <span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1247310"></span><strong>mechanoreceptor</strong> (as shown in</p> </div> <p><a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1188" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-1-sensory-processes/#attachment_1188">Figure 17.2</a>) possesses specialized membranes that respond to pressure. Disturbance of these dendrites by compressing them or bending them opens gated ion channels in the plasma membrane of the sensory neuron, changing its electrical potential. Recall that in the nervous system, a positive change of a neuron’s electrical potential (also called the membrane potential), depolarizes the neuron. Receptor potentials are graded potentials: the magnitude of these graded (receptor) potentials varies with the strength of the stimulus. If the magnitude of depolarization is sufficient (that is, if membrane potential reaches a threshold), the neuron will fire an action potential. In most cases, the correct stimulus impinging on a sensory receptor will drive membrane potential in a positive direction, although for some receptors, such as those in the visual system, this is not always the case.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1188" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1188" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_01_01f.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_01_01f.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4886" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1.jpg" alt="Figure_36_01_01f" width="500" height="441" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1-300x265.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1-768x677.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1-65x57.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1-225x198.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_36_01_01f-1024x903-1-350x309.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1188">Figure 17.2.&nbsp; (a) Mechanosensitive ion channels are gated ion channels that respond to mechanical deformation of the plasma membrane.

For example, touch receptors, light receptors, and sound receptors are each activated by different stimuli. Touch receptors are not sensitive to light or sound; they are sensitive only to touch or pressure. However, stimuli may be combined at higher levels in the brain, as happens with olfaction, contributing to our sense of taste.</p> <div class="section" title="Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44754-fs-idp69084640" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Encoding and Transmission of Sensory Information</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp78590960"></span>Four aspects of sensory information are encoded by sensory systems: the type of stimulus, the location of the stimulus in the receptive field, the duration of the stimulus, and the relative intensity of the stimulus. Thus, action potentials transmitted over a sensory receptor’s afferent axons encode one type of stimulus, and this segregation of the senses is preserved in other sensory circuits. For example, auditory receptors transmit signals over their own dedicated system, and electrical activity in the axons of the auditory receptors will be interpreted by the brain as an auditory stimulus—a sound.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp171530400"></span>The intensity of a stimulus is often encoded in the rate of action potentials produced by the sensory receptor. Thus, an intense stimulus will produce a more rapid train of action potentials, and reducing the stimulus will likewise slow the rate of production of action potentials. A second way in which intensity is encoded is by the number of receptors activated. An intense stimulus might initiate action potentials in a large number of adjacent receptors, while a less intense stimulus might stimulate fewer receptors. Integration of sensory information begins as soon as the information is received in the CNS, and the brain will further process incoming signals.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Perception"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44754-fs-idp99711392" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Perception</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44754-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1247414"></span><strong>Perception</strong> is an individual’s interpretation of a sensation. Although perception relies on the activation of sensory receptors, perception happens not at the level of the sensory receptor, but at higher levels in the nervous system, in the brain. The brain distinguishes sensory stimuli through a sensory pathway: action potentials from sensory receptors travel along neurons that are dedicated to a particular stimulus. These neurons are dedicated to that particular stimulus and synapse with particular neurons in the brain or spinal cord.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp103757536"></span>All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, are transmitted though the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus and to the appropriate region of the cortex. Recall that the thalamus is a structure in the forebrain that serves as a clearinghouse and relay station for sensory (as well as motor) signals. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1189" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-1-sensory-processes/#attachment_1189">Figure 17.3</a>) dedicated to processing that particular sense.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp40037520"></span>How are neural signals interpreted? Interpretation of sensory signals between individuals of the same species is largely similar, owing to the inherited similarity of their nervous systems; however, there are some individual differences. A good example of this is individual tolerances to a painful stimulus, such as dental pain, which certainly differ.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1189" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1189" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4887" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1.jpg" alt="Figure_36_01_02" width="600" height="251" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1-300x126.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1-768x322.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1-65x27.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1-225x94.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_01_02-1024x429-1-350x147.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1189">Figure 17.3.&nbsp; In humans, with the exception of olfaction, all sensory signals are routed from the (a) thalamus to (b) final processing regions in the cortex of the brain.

Apply the same principle to the 20-pound group (20 to 40, 20 to 38, and so on, and 20 to 22, 20 to 24, and so on). Given the large difference between 20 and 40 pounds, you may wish to use 30 pounds as your larger weight.

Perception is an individual interpretation of a sensation and is a brain function. Humans have special senses: olfaction, gustation, equilibrium, and hearing, plus the general senses of somatosensation.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp45026640"></span>Sensory receptors are either specialized cells associated with sensory neurons or the specialized ends of sensory neurons that are a part of the peripheral nervous system, and they are used to receive information about the environment (internal or external). Each sensory receptor is modified for the type of stimulus it detects. For example, neither gustatory receptors nor auditory receptors are sensitive to light. Each sensory receptor is responsive to stimuli within a specific region in space, which is known as that receptor’s receptive field. The most fundamental function of a sensory system is the translation of a sensory signal to an electrical signal in the nervous system.</p> <p><span id="m44754-fs-idp160588160"></span>All sensory signals, except those from the olfactory system, enter the central nervous system and are routed to the thalamus. When the sensory signal exits the thalamus, it is conducted to the specific area of the cortex dedicated to processing that particular sense.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is false? <ol><li>Pacini corpuscles are found in both glabrous and hairy skin.</li> <li>Merkel’s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.</li> <li>Ruffini endings are encapsulated mechanoreceptors.</li> <li>Meissner’s corpuscles extend into the lower dermis.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Where does perception occur? <ol><li>spinal cord</li> <li>cerebral cortex</li> <li>receptors</li> <li>thalamus</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44754-fs-idp38470112">If a person’s cold receptors no longer convert cold stimuli into sensory signals, that person has a problem with the process of ________.</span> <ol><li>reception</li> <li>transmission</li> <li>perception</li> <li>transduction</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44754-fs-idm24552512"><span id="m44754-fs-idp208362224"></span>After somatosensory transduction, the sensory signal travels through the brain as a(n) _____ signal.</span> <ol><li>electrical</li> <li>pressure</li> <li>optical</li> <li>thermal</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>D</li> <li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>A</li> </ol> </div> <div id="id790893" class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="section" title="Higher Processing"><div id="m44761-fs-idp51526480" class="note interactive"><div class="body"></div> </div> <div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <dl><dt><strong>kinesthesia</strong></dt> <dd>sense of body movement</dd> <dt><strong>mechanoreceptor</strong></dt> <dd>sensory receptor modified to respond to mechanical disturbance such as being bent, touch, pressure, motion, and sound</dd> <dt><strong>perception</strong></dt> <dd>individual interpretation of a sensation; a brain function</dd> <dt><strong>proprioception</strong></dt> <dd>sense of limb position; used to track kinesthesia</dd> <dt><strong>reception</strong></dt> <dd>receipt of a signal (such as light or sound) by sensory receptors</dd> <dt><strong>receptive field</strong></dt> <dd>region in space in which a stimulus can activate a given sensory receptor</dd> <dt><strong>receptor potential</strong></dt> <dd>membrane potential in a sensory receptor in response to detection of a stimulus</dd> <dt><strong>sensory receptor</strong></dt> <dd>specialized neuron or other cells associated with a neuron that is modified to receive specific sensory input</dd> <dt><strong>sensory transduction</strong></dt> <dd>conversion of a sensory stimulus into electrical energy in the nervous system by a change in the membrane potential</dd> <dt><strong>vestibular sense</strong></dt> <dd>sense of spatial orientation and balance</dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>

Somatosensation is also known as tactile sense, or more familiarly, as the sense of touch. Somatosensation occurs all over the exterior of the body and at some interior locations as well. A variety of receptor types—embedded in the skin, mucous membranes, muscles, joints, internal organs, and cardiovascular system—play a role.</p> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm94876192"></span>Recall that the epidermis is the outermost layer of skin in mammals. It is relatively thin, is composed of keratin-filled cells, and has no blood supply. The epidermis serves as a barrier to water and to invasion by pathogens. Below this, the much thicker dermis contains blood vessels, sweat glands, hair follicles, lymph vessels, and lipid-secreting sebaceous glands (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1190" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-2-somatosensation/#attachment_1190">Figure 17.4</a>). Below the epidermis and dermis is the subcutaneous tissue, or hypodermis, the fatty layer that contains blood vessels, connective tissue, and the axons of sensory neurons. The hypodermis, which holds about 50 percent of the body’s fat, attaches the dermis to the bone and muscle, and supplies nerves and blood vessels to the dermis.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1190" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4890" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure_36_02_01" width="400" height="361" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01-300x271.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01-65x59.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01-225x203.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_02_01-350x316.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1190">Figure 17.4.&nbsp; Mammalian skin has three layers: an epidermis, a dermis, and a hypodermis.

These categories are based on the nature of stimuli each receptor class transduces. What is commonly referred to as “touch” involves more than one kind of stimulus and more than one kind of receptor. Mechanoreceptors in the skin are described as encapsulated (that is, surrounded by a capsule) or unencapsulated (a group that includes free nerve endings). A <span id="m44757-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1784726"></span><strong>free nerve ending</strong>, as its name implies, is an unencapsulated dendrite of a sensory neuron. Free nerve endings are the most common nerve endings in skin, and they extend into the middle of the epidermis. Free nerve endings are sensitive to painful stimuli, to hot and cold, and to light touch. They are slow to adjust to a stimulus and so are less sensitive to abrupt changes in stimulation.</p> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm10056800"></span>There are three classes of mechanoreceptors: tactile, proprioceptors, and baroreceptors. Mechanoreceptors sense stimuli due to physical deformation of their plasma membranes. They contain mechanically gated ion channels whose gates open or close in response to pressure, touch, stretching, and sound.” There are four primary tactile mechanoreceptors in human skin: Merkel’s disks, Meissner’s corpuscles, Ruffini endings, and Pacinian corpuscle; two are located toward the surface of the skin and two are located deeper. A fifth type of mechanoreceptor, Krause end bulbs, are found only in specialized regions. <span id="m44757-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1784742"></span><strong>Merkel’s disks</strong> (shown in Figure 17.5) are found in the upper layers of skin near the base of the epidermis, both in skin that has hair and on <span id="m44757-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1711965"></span><strong>glabrous</strong> skin, that is, the hairless skin found on the palms and fingers, the soles of the feet, and the lips of humans and other primates. Merkel’s disks are densely distributed in the fingertips and lips. They are slow-adapting, unencapsulated nerve endings, and they respond to light touch. Light touch, also known as discriminative touch, is a light pressure that allows the location of a stimulus to be pinpointed. The receptive fields of Merkel’s disks are small with well-defined borders. That makes them finely sensitive to edges and they come into use in tasks such as typing on a keyboard.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1191" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_02_02.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_02_02.png"><img class="wp-image-4891" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02.png" alt="Figure_36_02_02" width="400" height="208" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02.png 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02-300x156.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02-65x34.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02-225x117.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_02_02-350x182.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1191">Figure 17.5.&nbsp; Four of the primary mechanoreceptors in human skin are shown.

Proprioceptive and kinesthetic signals come from limbs. Unconscious proprioceptive signals run from the spinal cord to the cerebellum, the brain region that coordinates muscle contraction, rather than to the thalamus, like most other sensory information.</p> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm140157936"></span>Barorecptors detect pressure changes in an organ.

The nociceptive receptors—those that detect pain—are located near the surface. Small, finely calibrated mechanoreceptors—Merkel’s disks and Meissner’s corpuscles—are located in the upper layers and can precisely localize even gentle touch. The large mechanoreceptors—Pacinian corpuscles and Ruffini endings—are located in the lower layers and respond to deeper touch. (Consider that the deep pressure that reaches those deeper receptors would not need to be finely localized.) Both the upper and lower layers of the skin hold rapidly and slowly adapting receptors. Both primary somatosensory cortex and secondary cortical areas are responsible for processing the complex picture of stimuli transmitted from the interplay of mechanoreceptors.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Density of Mechanoreceptors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44757-fs-idm147853312" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Density of Mechanoreceptors</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idp4306848"></span>The distribution of touch receptors in human skin is not consistent over the body.

Touch receptors are denser in glabrous skin (the type found on human fingertips and lips, for example), which is typically more sensitive and is thicker than hairy skin (4 to 5 mm versus 2 to 3 mm).</p> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idp12283952"></span>How is receptor density estimated in a human subject? The relative density of pressure receptors in different locations on the body can be demonstrated experimentally using a two-point discrimination test. In this demonstration, two sharp points, such as two thumbtacks, are brought into contact with the subject’s skin (though not hard enough to cause pain or break the skin). The subject reports if he or she feels one point or two points. If the two points are felt as one point, it can be inferred that the two points are both in the receptive field of a single sensory receptor. If two points are felt as two separate points, each is in the receptive field of two separate sensory receptors. The points could then be moved closer and re-tested until the subject reports feeling only one point, and the size of the receptive field of a single receptor could be estimated from that distance.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Thermoreception"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44757-fs-idm211054720" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Thermoreception</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm160095024"></span>In addition to Krause end bulbs that detect cold and Ruffini endings that detect warmth, there are different types of cold receptors on some free nerve endings: thermoreceptors, located in the dermis, skeletal muscles, liver, and hypothalamus, that are activated by different temperatures.

Warmth and cold information from the face travels through one of the cranial nerves to the brain. You know from experience that a tolerably cold or hot stimulus can quickly progress to a much more intense stimulus that is no longer tolerable. Any stimulus that is too intense can be perceived as pain because temperature sensations are conducted along the same pathways that carry pain sensations</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Pain"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44757-fs-idm214352368" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Pain</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Pain is the name given to <strong><span id="m44757-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1768143"></span>nociception</strong>, which is the neural processing of injurious stimuli in response to tissue damage. Pain is caused by true sources of injury, such as contact with a heat source that causes a thermal burn or contact with a corrosive chemical. But pain also can be caused by harmless stimuli that mimic the action of damaging stimuli, such as contact with capsaicins, the compounds that cause peppers to taste hot and which are used in self-defense pepper sprays and certain topical medications. Peppers taste “hot” because the protein receptors that bind capsaicin open the same calcium channels that are activated by warm receptors.</p> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm132414512"></span>Nociception starts at the sensory receptors, but pain, inasmuch as it is the perception of nociception, does not start until it is communicated to the brain. There are several nociceptive pathways to and through the brain. Most axons carrying nociceptive information into the brain from the spinal cord project to the thalamus (as do other sensory neurons) and the neural signal undergoes final processing in the primary somatosensory cortex. Interestingly, one nociceptive pathway projects not to the thalamus but directly to the hypothalamus in the forebrain, which modulates the cardiovascular and neuroendocrine functions of the autonomic nervous system. Recall that threatening—or painful—stimuli stimulate the sympathetic branch of the visceral sensory system, readying a fight-or-flight response.</p> <h2>Concept in Action</h2> <div id="m44757-fs-idm50149456" class="note interactive"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44757-fs-idm160186608"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/nociceptive.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44757-fs-idm87424368"></span>View this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nociceptive" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/nociceptive">video</a> that animates the five phases of nociceptive pain.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Somatosensation includes all sensation received from the skin and mucous membranes, as well as from the limbs and joints.

Meissner’s corpuscles, found in glabrous skin, are rapidly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect touch, low-frequency vibration, and flutter. Ruffini endings are slowly adapting, encapsulated receptors that detect skin stretch, joint activity, and warmth. Hair receptors are rapidly adapting nerve endings wrapped around the base of hair follicles that detect hair movement and skin deflection.

Smell lets an animal sense the presence of food or other animals—whether potential mates, predators, or prey—or other chemicals in the environment that can impact their survival. Similarly, the sense of taste allows animals to discriminate between types of foods. While the value of a sense of smell is obvious, what is the value of a sense of taste? Different tasting foods have different attributes, both helpful and harmful. For example, sweet-tasting substances tend to be highly caloric, which could be necessary for survival in lean times. Bitterness is associated with toxicity, and sourness is associated with spoiled food. Salty foods are valuable in maintaining homeostasis by helping the body retain water and by providing ions necessary for cells to function.</p> <div class="section" title="Tastes and Odors"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44764-fs-idp117278560" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Tastes and Odors</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp155682448"></span>Both taste and odor stimuli are molecules taken in from the environment. The primary tastes detected by humans are sweet, sour, bitter, salty and umami. The first four tastes need little explanation. The identification of <span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1839996"></span><strong>umami</strong> as a fundamental taste occurred fairly recently—it was identified in 1908 by Japanese scientist Kikunae Ikeda while he worked with seaweed broth, but it was not widely accepted as a taste that could be physiologically distinguished until many years later. The taste of umami, also known as savoriness, is attributable to the taste of the amino acid L-glutamate. In fact, monosodium glutamate, or MSG, is often used in cooking to enhance the savory taste of certain foods. What is the adaptive value of being able to distinguish umami? Savory substances tend to be high in protein.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp247695328"></span>All odors that we perceive are molecules in the air we breathe. If a substance does not release molecules into the air from its surface, it has no smell. And if a human or other animal does not have a receptor that recognizes a specific molecule, then that molecule has no smell. Humans have about 350 olfactory receptor subtypes that work in various combinations to allow us to sense about 10,000 different odors. Compare that to mice, for example, which have about 1,300 olfactory receptor types, and therefore probably sense more odors. Both odors and tastes involve molecules that stimulate specific chemoreceptors. Although humans commonly distinguish taste as one sense and smell as another, they work together to create the perception of flavor. A person’s perception of flavor is reduced if he or she has congested nasal passages.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Reception and Transduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44764-fs-idp10916192" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Reception and Transduction</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp174530608"></span> <span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1834540"></span><strong>Odorants</strong> (odor molecules) enter the nose and dissolve in the olfactory epithelium, the mucosa at the back of the nasal cavity (as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1195" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-3-taste-and-smell/#attachment_1195">Figure 17.8</a>). The <strong><span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1834552"></span>olfactory epithelium</strong> is a collection of specialized olfactory receptors in the back of the nasal cavity that spans an area about 5 cm<sup>2</sup> in humans. Recall that sensory cells are neurons. An <strong><span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1834560"></span>olfactory receptor</strong>, which is a dendrite of a specialized neuron, responds when it binds certain molecules inhaled from the environment by sending impulses directly to the olfactory bulb of the brain. Humans have about 12 million olfactory receptors, distributed among hundreds of different receptor types that respond to different odors. Twelve million seems like a large number of receptors, but compare that to other animals: rabbits have about 100 million, most dogs have about 1 billion, and bloodhounds—dogs selectively bred for their sense of smell—have about 4 billion. The overall size of the olfactory epithelium also differs between species, with that of bloodhounds, for example, being many times larger than that of humans.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp93385696"></span>Olfactory neurons are <span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1827615"></span><strong>bipolar neurons</strong> (neurons with two processes from the cell body). Each neuron has a single dendrite buried in the olfactory epithelium, and extending from this dendrite are 5 to 20 receptor-laden, hair-like cilia that trap odorant molecules. The sensory receptors on the cilia are proteins, and it is the variations in their amino acid chains that make the receptors sensitive to different odorants. Each olfactory sensory neuron has only one type of receptor on its cilia, and the receptors are specialized to detect specific odorants, so the bipolar neurons themselves are specialized. When an odorant binds with a receptor that recognizes it, the sensory neuron associated with the receptor is stimulated. Olfactory stimulation is the only sensory information that directly reaches the cerebral cortex, whereas other sensations are relayed through the thalamus.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1195" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4897" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01.jpg" alt="Figure_36_03_01" width="400" height="278" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01-300x208.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01-768x533.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01-225x156.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_03_01-350x243.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1195">Figure 17.8.&nbsp; In the human olfactory system, (a) bipolar olfactory neurons extend from (b) the olfactory epithelium, where olfactory receptors are located, to the olfactory bulb.

Pheromonal signals can have profound effects on animals that inhale them, but pheromones apparently are not consciously perceived in the same way as other odors. There are several different types of pheromones, which are released in urine or as glandular secretions. Certain pheromones are attractants to potential mates, others are repellants to potential competitors of the same sex, and still others play roles in mother-infant attachment. Some pheromones can also influence the timing of puberty, modify reproductive cycles, and even prevent embryonic implantation. While the roles of pheromones in many nonhuman species are important, pheromones have become less important in human behavior over evolutionary time compared to their importance to organisms with more limited behavioral repertoires.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp259638128"></span>The vomeronasal organ (VNO, or Jacobson’s organ) is a tubular, fluid-filled, olfactory organ present in many vertebrate animals that sits adjacent to the nasal cavity. It is very sensitive to pheromones and is connected to the nasal cavity by a duct. When molecules dissolve in the mucosa of the nasal cavity, they then enter the VNO where the pheromone molecules among them bind with specialized pheromone receptors. Upon exposure to pheromones from their own species or others, many animals, including cats, may display the flehmen response (shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.9.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1196" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-3-taste-and-smell/#attachment_1196">Figure 17.9</a>), a curling of the upper lip that helps pheromone molecules enter the VNO.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp48589024"></span>Pheromonal signals are sent, not to the main olfactory bulb, but to a different neural structure that projects directly to the amygdala (recall that the amygdala is a brain center important in emotional reactions, such as fear). The pheromonal signal then continues to areas of the hypothalamus that are key to reproductive physiology and behavior. While some scientists assert that the VNO is apparently functionally vestigial in humans, even though there is a similar structure located near human nasal cavities, others are researching it as a possible functional system that may, for example, contribute to synchronization of menstrual cycles in women living in close proximity.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1196" style="width: 544px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_03_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_03_02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4898" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_03_02.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;36.9.&nbsp; The flehmen response in this tiger results in the curling of the upper lip and helps airborne pheromone molecules enter the vomeronasal organ.

Thus, like olfaction, each receptor is specific to its stimulus (tastant). Transduction of the five tastes happens through different mechanisms that reflect the molecular composition of the tastant. A salty tastant (containing NaCl) provides the sodium ions (Na<sup>+</sup>) that enter the taste neurons and excite them directly. Sour tastants are acids and belong to the thermoreceptor protein family. Binding of an acid or other sour-tasting molecule triggers a change in the ion channel and these increase hydrogen ion (H<sup>+</sup>) concentrations in the taste neurons, thus depolarizing them. Sweet, bitter, and umami tastants require a G-protein coupled receptor. These tastants bind to their respective receptors, thereby exciting the specialized neurons associated with them.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp67938160"></span>Both tasting abilities and sense of smell change with age. In humans, the senses decline dramatically by age 50 and continue to decline. A child may find a food to be too spicy, whereas an elderly person may find the same food to be bland and unappetizing.</p> <div id="m44764-fs-idp33174096" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44764-fs-idp261625104"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/taste.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp128664496"></span>View this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/taste" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/taste">animation</a> that shows how the sense of taste works.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Smell and Taste in the Brain"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44764-fs-idp19236672" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Smell and Taste in the Brain</span></span><span id="m44764-fs-idp79944432"></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Olfactory neurons project from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb as thin, unmyelinated axons. The <span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1831547"></span><strong>olfactory bulb</strong> is composed of neural clusters called <span id="m44764-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1831550"></span><strong>glomeruli</strong>, and each glomerulus receives signals from one type of olfactory receptor, so each glomerulus is specific to one odorant. From glomeruli, olfactory signals travel directly to the olfactory cortex and then to the frontal cortex and the thalamus. Recall that this is a different path from most other sensory information, which is sent directly to the thalamus before ending up in the cortex. Olfactory signals also travel directly to the amygdala, thereafter reaching the hypothalamus, thalamus, and frontal cortex. The last structure that olfactory signals directly travel to is a cortical center in the temporal lobe structure important in spatial, autobiographical, declarative, and episodic memories. Olfaction is finally processed by areas of the brain that deal with memory, emotions, reproduction, and thought.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp93151360"></span>Taste neurons project from taste cells in the tongue, esophagus, and palate to the medulla, in the brainstem. From the medulla, taste signals travel to the thalamus and then to the primary gustatory cortex. Information from different regions of the tongue is segregated in the medulla, thalamus, and cortex.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>There are five primary tastes in humans: sweet, sour, bitter, salty, and umami. Each taste has its own receptor type that responds only to that taste. Tastants enter the body and are dissolved in saliva. Taste cells are located within taste buds, which are found on three of the four types of papillae in the mouth.</p> <p><span id="m44764-fs-idp132349712"></span>Regarding olfaction, there are many thousands of odorants, but humans detect only about 10,000. Like taste receptors, olfactory receptors are each responsive to only one odorant. Odorants dissolve in nasal mucosa, where they excite their corresponding olfactory sensory cells. When these cells detect an odorant, they send their signals to the main olfactory bulb and then to other locations in the brain, including the olfactory cortex.</p> <div class="section" title="Higher Processing"><div class="note interactive"><div class="body"><div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following has the fewest taste receptors? <ol><li>fungiform papillae</li> <li>circumvallate papillae</li> <li>foliate papillae</li> <li>filiform papillae</li> </ol> </li> <li>How many different taste molecules do taste cells each detect? <ol><li>one</li> <li>five</li> <li>ten</li> <li>It depends on the spot on the tongue</li> </ol> </li> <li>Salty foods activate the taste cells by ______. <ol><li>exciting the taste cell directly</li> <li>causing hydrogen ions to enter the cell</li> <li>causing sodium channels to close</li> <li>binding directly to the receptors</li> </ol> </li> <li>All sensory signals except _____ travel to the _____ in the brain before the cerebral cortex. <ol><li>vision; thalamus</li> <li>olfaction; thalmus</li> <li>vision; cranial nerves</li> <li>olfaction; cranial nerves</li> </ol> </li> <li>From the perspective of the recipient of the signal, in what ways do pheromones differ from other odorants?</li> <li>What might be the effect on an animal of not being able to perceive taste?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>D</li> <li>A</li> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>Pheromones may not be consciously perceived, and pheromones can have direct physiological and behavioral effects on their recipients.</li> <li>The animal might not be able to recognize the differences in food sources and thus might not be able to discriminate between spoiled food and safe food or between foods that contain necessary nutrients, such as proteins, and foods that do not.</li> </ol> </div> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="cnx-eoc art-exercise"><div class="section empty"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="cnx-eoc multiple-choice"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44764-fs-idp207279936" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><p><span id="m44764-fs-idp232916288"></span> <span id="m44764-fs-idp119624912">1. </span>Which of the following has the fewest taste receptors?</p> <div class="orderedlist"><p>A) fungiform papillae</p> <p>B) circumvallate papillae</p> <p>C) foliate papillae</p> <p>D) filiform papillae</p> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idp136791536" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><span id="m44764-fs-idp17900400">Answer: </span>D</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idp12473408" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><p><span id="m44764-fs-idm47740544"></span> <span id="m44764-fs-idp52059728">2. </span>How many different taste molecules do taste cells each detect?</p> <div class="orderedlist"><p>A) one</p> <p>B) five</p> <p>C) ten</p> <p>D) It depends on the spot on the tongue</p> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idm2197616" class="solution labeled"><div class="title"><span id="m44764-fs-idp54308944">Answer: </span>A</div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idp54312992" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><p><span id="m44764-fs-idp141071216"></span> <span id="m44764-fs-idp136286976">3. </span>Salty foods activate the taste cells by _____.</p> <div class="orderedlist"><p>A) exciting the taste cell directly</p> <p>B) causing hydrogen ions to enter the cell</p> <p>C) causing sodium channels to close</p> <p>D) binding directly to the receptors</p> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idp170039696" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><span id="m44764-fs-idp93500800">Answer: </span>A</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id="m44764-fs-idp166670496" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><p>4.

It enables an organism to detect and receive information about danger, such as an approaching predator, and to participate in communal exchanges like those concerning territories or mating. On the other hand, although it is physically linked to the auditory system, the vestibular system is not involved in hearing. Instead, an animal’s vestibular system detects its own movement, both linear and angular acceleration and deceleration, and balance.</p> <div class="section" title="Sound"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44760-fs-idm533680" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Sound</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp188300560"></span>Auditory stimuli are sound waves, which are mechanical, pressure waves that move through a medium, such as air or water. There are no sound waves in a vacuum since there are no air molecules to move in waves. The speed of sound waves differs, based on altitude, temperature, and medium, but at sea level and a temperature of 20º C (68º F), sound waves travel in the air at about 343 meters per second.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp57187056"></span>As is true for all waves, there are four main characteristics of a sound wave: frequency, wavelength, period, and amplitude. Frequency is the number of waves per unit of time, and in sound is heard as pitch. High-frequency (≥15.000Hz) sounds are higher-pitched (short wavelength) than low-frequency (long wavelengths; ≤100Hz) sounds. Frequency is measured in cycles per second, and for sound, the most commonly used unit is hertz (Hz), or cycles per second. Most humans can perceive sounds with frequencies between 30 and 20,000 Hz. Women are typically better at hearing high frequencies, but everyone’s ability to hear high frequencies decreases with age. Dogs detect up to about 40,000 Hz; cats, 60,000 Hz; bats, 100,000 Hz; and dolphins 150,000 Hz, and American shad (<strong><span class="emphasis">Alosa sapidissima</span></strong>), a fish, can hear 180,000 Hz. Those frequencies above the human range are called <strong><span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1801881"></span>ultrasound</strong>.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp211681184"></span>Amplitude, or the dimension of a wave from peak to trough, in sound is heard as volume and is illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.12.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1200" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-4-hearing-and-vestibular-sensation/#attachment_1200">Figure 17.12</a>.

Interior to the tympanum is the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1829889"></span><strong>middle ear</strong>. The middle ear holds three small bones called the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1829892"></span><strong>ossicles,</strong> which transfer energy from the moving tympanum to the inner ear.

The aptly named stapes looks very much like a stirrup. The three ossicles are unique to mammals, and each plays a role in hearing. The malleus attaches at three points to the interior surface of the tympanic membrane. The incus attaches the malleus to the stapes. In humans, the stapes is not long enough to reach the tympanum. If we did not have the malleus and the incus, then the vibrations of the tympanum would never reach the inner ear. These bones also function to collect force and amplify sounds. The ear ossicles are homologous to bones in a fish mouth: the bones that support gills in fish are thought to be adapted for use in the vertebrate ear over evolutionary time. Many animals (frogs, reptiles, and birds, for example) use the stapes of the middle ear to transmit vibrations to the middle ear.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1201" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4905" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1.jpg" alt="Figure_36_04_02" width="600" height="393" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1-300x196.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1-768x503.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1-225x147.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_02-1024x670-1-350x229.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1201">Figure 17.13.&nbsp; Sound travels through the outer ear to the middle ear, which is bounded on its exterior by the tympanic membrane.

When these pressure waves reach the ear, the ear transduces this mechanical stimulus (pressure wave) into a nerve impulse (electrical signal) that the brain perceives as sound. The pressure waves strike the tympanum, causing it to vibrate. The mechanical energy from the moving tympanum transmits the vibrations to the three bones of the middle ear. The stapes transmits the vibrations to a thin diaphragm called the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1822762"></span><strong>oval window</strong>, which is the outermost structure of the <strong><span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1822766"></span>inner ear</strong>. The structures of the inner ear are found in the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1822769"></span><strong>labyrinth</strong>, a bony, hollow structure that is the most interior portion of the ear. Here, the energy from the sound wave is transferred from the stapes through the flexible oval window and to the fluid of the cochlea. The vibrations of the oval window create pressure waves in the fluid (perilymph) inside the cochlea. The <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1822775"></span><strong>cochlea</strong> is a whorled structure, like the shell of a snail, and it contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal (as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.14.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1202" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-4-hearing-and-vestibular-sensation/#attachment_1202">Figure 17.14</a>). Inside the cochlea, the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1823003"></span><strong>basilar membrane</strong> is a mechanical analyzer that runs the length of the cochlea, curling toward the cochlea’s center.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idm20995904"></span>The mechanical properties of the basilar membrane change along its length, such that it is thicker, tauter, and narrower at the outside of the whorl (where the cochlea is largest), and thinner, floppier, and broader toward the apex, or center, of the whorl (where the cochlea is smallest). Different regions of the basilar membrane vibrate according to the frequency of the sound wave conducted through the fluid in the cochlea. For these reasons, the fluid-filled cochlea detects different wave frequencies (pitches) at different regions of the membrane. When the sound waves in the cochlear fluid contact the basilar membrane, it flexes back and forth in a wave-like fashion. Above the basilar membrane is the <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1823017"></span><strong>tectorial membrane</strong>.</p> <div id="m44760-fs-idp206707392" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44760-fig-ch36_04_03" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.14.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1202" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf.png"><img class="wp-image-4906" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf.png" alt="Figure_36_04_03abcf" width="450" height="432" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf.png 1018w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf-300x288.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf-768x738.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf-65x62.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf-225x216.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_03abcf-350x336.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1202">Figure 17.14.&nbsp; In the human ear, sound waves cause the stapes to press against the oval window. Vibrations travel up the fluid-filled interior of the cochlea. The basilar membrane that lines the cochlea gets continuously thinner toward the apex of the cochlea. Different thicknesses of membrane vibrate in response to different frequencies of sound. Sound waves then exit through the round window. In the cross section of the cochlea (top right figure), note that in addition to the upper canal and lower canal, the cochlea also has a middle canal.

It is composed of hair cells held in place above the basilar membrane like flowers projecting up from soil, with their exposed short, hair-like <span id="m44760-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1826294"></span><strong>stereocilia</strong> contacting or embedded in the tectorial membrane above them. The inner hair cells are the primary auditory receptors and exist in a single row, numbering approximately 3,500. The stereocilia from inner hair cells extend into small dimples on the tectorial membrane’s lower surface. The outer hair cells are arranged in three or four rows. They number approximately 12,000, and they function to fine tune incoming sound waves. The longer stereocilia that project from the outer hair cells actually attach to the tectorial membrane. All of the stereocilia are mechanoreceptors, and when bent by vibrations they respond by opening a gated ion channel (refer to <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.2.&nbsp;" href="#chapter-17-1-sensory-processes" data-url="/chapter/17-1-sensory-processes/">Figure 17.2</a>). As a result, the hair cell membrane is depolarized, and a signal is transmitted to the chochlear nerve. Intensity (volume) of sound is determined by how many hair cells at a particular location are stimulated.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp10940352"></span>The hair cells are arranged on the basilar membrane in an orderly way. The basilar membrane vibrates in different regions, according to the frequency of the sound waves impinging on it. Likewise, the hair cells that lay above it are most sensitive to a specific frequency of sound waves. Hair cells can respond to a small range of similar frequencies, but they require stimulation of greater intensity to fire at frequencies outside of their optimal range. The difference in response frequency between adjacent inner hair cells is about 0.2 percent. Compare that to adjacent piano strings, which are about six percent different. Place theory, which is the model for how biologists think pitch detection works in the human ear, states that high frequency sounds selectively vibrate the basilar membrane of the inner ear near the entrance port (the oval window). Lower frequencies travel farther along the membrane before causing appreciable excitation of the membrane. The basic pitch-determining mechanism is based on the location along the membrane where the hair cells are stimulated. The place theory is the first step toward an understanding of pitch perception. Considering the extreme pitch sensitivity of the human ear, it is thought that there must be some auditory “sharpening” mechanism to enhance the pitch resolution.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp97579312"></span>When sound waves produce fluid waves inside the cochlea, the basilar membrane flexes, bending the stereocilia that attach to the tectorial membrane. Their bending results in action potentials in the hair cells, and auditory information travels along the neural endings of the bipolar neurons of the hair cells (collectively, the auditory nerve) to the brain. When the hairs bend, they release an excitatory neurotransmitter at a synapse with a sensory neuron, which then conducts action potentials to the central nervous system. The cochlear branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve sends information on hearing. The auditory system is very refined, and there is some modulation or “sharpening” built in. The brain can send signals back to the cochlea, resulting in a change of length in the outer hair cells, sharpening or dampening the hair cells’ response to certain frequencies.</p> <div id="m44760-fs-idp66837200" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44760-fs-idp98735632"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/hearing.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp141612608"></span>Watch an <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hearing" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/hearing">animation</a> of sound entering the outer ear, moving through the ear structure, stimulating cochlear nerve impulses, and eventually sending signals to the temporal lobe.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Higher Processing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44760-fs-idp191611472" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Higher Processing</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp100118384"></span>The inner hair cells are most important for conveying auditory information to the brain. About 90 percent of the afferent neurons carry information from inner hair cells, with each hair cell synapsing with 10 or so neurons. Outer hair cells connect to only 10 percent of the afferent neurons, and each afferent neuron innervates many hair cells. The afferent, bipolar neurons that convey auditory information travel from the cochlea to the medulla, through the pons and midbrain in the brainstem, finally reaching the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Vestibular Information"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44760-fs-idp307938928" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Vestibular Information</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp8576816"></span>The stimuli associated with the vestibular system are linear acceleration (gravity) and angular acceleration and deceleration. Gravity, acceleration, and deceleration are detected by evaluating the inertia on receptive cells in the vestibular system. Gravity is detected through head position. Angular acceleration and deceleration are expressed through turning or tilting of the head.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp68969664"></span>The vestibular system has some similarities with the auditory system. It utilizes hair cells just like the auditory system, but it excites them in different ways. There are five vestibular receptor organs in the inner ear: the utricle, the saccule, and three semicircular canals. Together, they make up what’s known as the vestibular labyrinth that is shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.15.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1204" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-4-hearing-and-vestibular-sensation/#attachment_1204">Figure 17.15</a>. The utricle and saccule respond to acceleration in a straight line, such as gravity. The roughly 30,000 hair cells in the utricle and 16,000 hair cells in the saccule lie below a gelatinous layer, with their stereocilia projecting into the gelatin. Embedded in this gelatin are calcium carbonate crystals—like tiny rocks. When the head is tilted, the crystals continue to be pulled straight down by gravity, but the new angle of the head causes the gelatin to shift, thereby bending the stereocilia. The bending of the stereocilia stimulates the neurons, and they signal to the brain that the head is tilted, allowing the maintenance of balance. It is the vestibular branch of the vestibulocochlear cranial nerve that deals with balance.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1204" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_04_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4908" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04.jpg" alt="Figure_36_04_04" width="450" height="357" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04-300x238.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04-65x52.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04-225x179.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_04_04-350x278.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1204">Figure 17.15.&nbsp; The structure of the vestibular labyrinth is shown.

They are arranged in three spatial planes. The base of each canal has a swelling that contains a cluster of hair cells. The hairs project into a gelatinous cap called the cupula and monitor angular acceleration and deceleration from rotation. They would be stimulated by driving your car around a corner, turning your head, or falling forward. One canal lies horizontally, while the other two lie at about 45 degree angles to the horizontal axis, as illustrated in Figure 17.15. When the brain processes input from all three canals together, it can detect angular acceleration or deceleration in three dimensions. When the head turns, the fluid in the canals shifts, thereby bending stereocilia and sending signals to the brain. Upon cessation accelerating or decelerating—or just moving—the movement of the fluid within the canals slows or stops. For example, imagine holding a glass of water. When moving forward, water may splash backwards onto the hand, and when motion has stopped, water may splash forward onto the fingers. While in motion, the water settles in the glass and does not splash. Note that the canals are not sensitive to velocity itself, but to changes in velocity, so moving forward at 60mph with your eyes closed would not give the sensation of movement, but suddenly accelerating or braking would stimulate the receptors.</p> <div class="section" title="Higher Processing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44760-fs-idm22416304" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Higher Processing</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp71338672"></span>Hair cells from the utricle, saccule, and semicircular canals also communicate through bipolar neurons to the cochlear nucleus in the medulla. Cochlear neurons send descending projections to the spinal cord and ascending projections to the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum. Connections to the cerebellum are important for coordinated movements. There are also projections to the temporal cortex, which account for feelings of dizziness; projections to autonomic nervous system areas in the brainstem, which account for motion sickness; and projections to the primary somatosensory cortex, which monitors subjective measurements of the external world and self-movement. People with lesions in the vestibular area of the somatosensory cortex see vertical objects in the world as being tilted. Finally, the vestibular signals project to certain optic muscles to coordinate eye and head movements.</p> <h2>Concept in Action</h2> <div id="m44760-fs-idm15641344" class="note interactive"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44760-fs-idp180165168"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/ear_anatomy.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp49670576"></span>Click through this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear_anatomy" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/ear_anatomy">interactive tutorial</a> to review the parts of the ear and how they function to process sound.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Audition is important for territory defense, predation, predator defense, and communal exchanges. The vestibular system, which is not auditory, detects linear acceleration and angular acceleration and deceleration. Both the auditory system and vestibular system use hair cells as their receptors.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idp195014624"></span>Auditory stimuli are sound waves. The sound wave energy reaches the outer ear (pinna, canal, tympanum), and vibrations of the tympanum send the energy to the middle ear. The middle ear bones shift and the stapes transfers mechanical energy to the oval window of the fluid-filled inner ear cochlea. Once in the cochlea, the energy causes the basilar membrane to flex, thereby bending the stereocilia on receptor hair cells. This activates the receptors, which send their auditory neural signals to the brain.</p> <p><span id="m44760-fs-idm15535872"></span>The vestibular system has five parts that work together to provide the sense of direction, thus helping to maintain balance. The utricle and saccule measure head orientation: their calcium carbonate crystals shift when the head is tilted, thereby activating hair cells. The semicircular canals work similarly, such that when the head is turned, the fluid in the canals bends stereocilia on hair cells. The vestibular hair cells also send signals to the thalamus and to somatosensory cortex, but also to the cerebellum, the structure above the brainstem that plays a large role in timing and coordination of movement.</p> <div class="section"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following types of hearing loss would not be restored by a cochlear implant? <ol><li>Hearing loss resulting from absence or loss of hair cells in the organ of Corti.</li> <li>Hearing loss resulting from an abnormal auditory nerve.</li> <li>Hearing loss resulting from fracture of the cochlea.</li> <li>Hearing loss resulting from damage to bones of the middle ear.</li> </ol> </li> <li>In sound, pitch is measured in _____, and volume is measured in _____. <ol><li>nanometers (nm); decibels (dB)</li> <li>decibels (dB); nanometers (nm)</li> <li>decibels (dB); hertz (Hz)</li> <li>hertz (Hz); decibels (dB)</li> </ol> </li> <li>Auditory hair cells are indirectly anchored to the _____. <ol><li>basilar membrane</li> <li>oval window</li> <li>tectorial membrane</li> <li>ossicles</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following are found both in the auditory system and the vestibular system? <ol><li>basilar membrane</li> <li>hair cells</li> <li>semicircular canals</li> <li>ossicles</li> </ol> </li> <li>How would a rise in altitude likely affect the speed of a sound transmitted through air?</li> <li>How might being in a place with less gravity than Earth has (such as Earth’s moon) affect vestibular sensation, and why?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>The sound would slow down, because it is transmitted through the particles (gas) and there are fewer particles (lower density) at higher altitudes.</li> <li>Because vestibular sensation relies on gravity’s effects on tiny crystals in the inner ear, a situation of reduced gravity would likely impair vestibular sensation.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class="title"><div class="section" title="Higher Processing"><div class="note interactive"></div> <div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <dl><dt><strong>audition</strong></dt> <dd>sense of hearing</dd> <dt><strong>basilar membrane</strong></dt> <dd>stiff structure in the cochlea that indirectly anchors auditory receptors</dd> <dt><strong>cochlea</strong></dt> <dd>whorled structure that contains receptors for transduction of the mechanical wave into an electrical signal</dd> <dd>s a specialized structure for detection of sensory stimuli; some respond to touch, pain, or temperature</dd> <dt><strong>incus</strong></dt> <dd>(also, anvil) second of the three bones of the middle ear</dd> <dt><strong>inner ear</strong></dt> <dd>innermost part of the ear; consists of the cochlea and the vestibular system</dd> <dt><strong>labyrinth</strong></dt> <dd>bony, hollow structure that is the most internal part of the ear; contains the sites of transduction of auditory and vestibular information</dd> <dt><strong>malleus</strong></dt> <dd>(also, hammer) first of the three bones of the middle ear</dd> <dt><strong>middle ear</strong></dt> <dd>part of the hearing apparatus that functions to transfer energy from the tympanum to the oval window of the inner ear</dd> <dt><strong>organ of Corti</strong></dt> <dd>in the basilar membrane, the site of the transduction of sound, a mechanical wave, to a neural signal</dd> <dt><strong>outer ear</strong></dt> <dd>part of the ear that consists of the pinna, ear canal, and tympanum and which conducts sound waves into the middle ear</dd> <dt><strong>oval window</strong></dt> <dd>thin diaphragm between the middle and inner ears that receives sound waves from contact with the stapes bone of the middle ear</dd> <dt><strong>pinna</strong></dt> <dd>cartilaginous outer ear</dd> <dt><strong>semicircular canal</strong></dt> <dd>one of three half-circular, fluid-filled tubes in the vestibular labyrinth that monitors angular acceleration and deceleration</dd> <dt><strong>stapes</strong></dt> <dd>(also, stirrup) third of the three bones of the middle ear</dd> <dt><strong>tectorial membrane</strong></dt> <dd>cochlear structure that lies above the hair cells and participates in the transduction of sound at the hair cells</dd> <dt><strong>tympanum</strong></dt> <dd>(also, tympanic membrane or ear drum) thin diaphragm between the outer and middle ears</dd> <dt><strong>ultrasound</strong></dt> <dd>sound frequencies above the human detectable ceiling of approximately 20,000 Hz</dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="exercise"></div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>

Animals are bombarded with sensory information, and the sheer volume of visual information can be problematic. Fortunately, the visual systems of species have evolved to attend to the most-important stimuli. The importance of vision to humans is further substantiated by the fact that about one-third of the human cerebral cortex is dedicated to analyzing and perceiving visual information.</p> <div class="section" title="Light"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44761-fs-idp118381680" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Light</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp48440384"></span>As with auditory stimuli, light travels in waves. The compression waves that compose sound must travel in a medium—a gas, a liquid, or a solid. In contrast, light is composed of electromagnetic waves and needs no medium; light can travel in a vacuum (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.16.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1206" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-5-vision/#attachment_1206">Figure 17.16</a>). The behavior of light can be discussed in terms of the behavior of waves and also in terms of the behavior of the fundamental unit of light—a packet of electromagnetic radiation called a photon. A glance at the electromagnetic spectrum shows that visible light for humans is just a small slice of the entire spectrum, which includes radiation that we cannot see as light because it is below the frequency of visible red light and above the frequency of visible violet light.</p> </div> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp165729760"></span>Certain variables are important when discussing perception of light. Wavelength (which varies inversely with frequency) manifests itself as hue. Light at the red end of the visible spectrum has longer wavelengths (and is lower frequency), while light at the violet end has shorter wavelengths (and is higher frequency). The wavelength of light is expressed in nanometers (nm); one nanometer is one billionth of a meter. Humans perceive light that ranges between approximately 380 nm and 740 nm. Some other animals, though, can detect wavelengths outside of the human range. For example, bees see near-ultraviolet light in order to locate nectar guides on flowers, and some non-avian reptiles sense infrared light (heat that prey gives off).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1206" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_05_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_05_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4912" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1.jpg" alt="Figure_36_05_01" width="600" height="254" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1-300x127.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1-768x325.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1-65x27.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1-225x95.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_36_05_01-1024x433-1-350x148.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1206">Figure 17.16.&nbsp; In the electromagnetic spectrum, visible light lies between 380 nm and 740 nm.

A large degree of processing of visual information occurs in the retina itself, before visual information is sent to the brain.</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp51630656"></span>Photoreceptors in the retina continuously undergo <span id="m44761-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1816308"></span><strong>tonic activity</strong>. That is, they are always slightly active even when not stimulated by light. In neurons that exhibit tonic activity, the absence of stimuli maintains a firing rate at a baseline; while some stimuli increase firing rate from the baseline, and other stimuli decrease firing rate. In the absence of light, the bipolar neurons that connect rods and cones to ganglion cells are continuously and actively inhibited by the rods and cones. Exposure of the retina to light hyperpolarizes the rods and cones and removes their inhibition of bipolar cells. The now active bipolar cells in turn stimulate the ganglion cells, which send action potentials along their axons (which leave the eye as the optic nerve). Thus, the visual system relies on change in retinal activity, rather than the absence or presence of activity, to encode visual signals for the brain. Sometimes horizontal cells carry signals from one rod or cone to other photoreceptors and to several bipolar cells. When a rod or cone stimulates a horizontal cell, the horizontal cell inhibits more distant photoreceptors and bipolar cells, creating lateral inhibition. This inhibition sharpens edges and enhances contrast in the images by making regions receiving light appear lighter and dark surroundings appear darker. Amacrine cells can distribute information from one bipolar cell to many ganglion cells.</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idm24639296"></span>You can demonstrate this using an easy demonstration to “trick” your retina and brain about the colors you are observing in your visual field. Look fixedly at <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;36.22.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1213" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/17-5-vision/#attachment_1213">Figure 17.22</a> for about 45 seconds. Then quickly shift your gaze to a sheet of blank white paper or a white wall. You should see an afterimage of the Norwegian flag in its correct colors. At this point, close your eyes for a moment, then reopen them, looking again at the white paper or wall; the afterimage of the flag should continue to appear as red, white, and blue. What causes this? According to an explanation called opponent process theory, as you gazed fixedly at the green, black, and yellow flag, your retinal ganglion cells that respond positively to green, black, and yellow increased their firing dramatically. When you shifted your gaze to the neutral white ground, these ganglion cells abruptly decreased their activity and the brain interpreted this abrupt downshift as if the ganglion cells were responding now to their “opponent” colors: red, white, and blue, respectively, in the visual field. Once the ganglion cells return to their baseline activity state, the false perception of color will disappear.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1213" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1213" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_05_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_36_05_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4919" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07.jpg" alt="Figure_36_05_07" width="450" height="325" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07-300x217.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07-65x47.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07-225x163.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_36_05_07-350x253.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1213">Figure 17.22.&nbsp; View this flag to understand how retinal processing works.

Within the nerves, different axons carry different qualities of the visual signal. Some axons constitute the magnocellular (big cell) pathway, which carries information about form, movement, depth, and differences in brightness. Other axons constitute the parvocellular (small cell) pathway, which carries information on color and fine detail. Some visual information projects directly back into the brain, while other information crosses to the opposite side of the brain. This crossing of optical pathways produces the distinctive optic chiasma (Greek, for “crossing”) found at the base of the brain and allows us to coordinate information from both eyes.</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp164837360"></span>Once in the brain, visual information is processed in several places, and its routes reflect the complexity and importance of visual information to humans and other animals. One route takes the signals to the thalamus, which serves as the routing station for all incoming sensory impulses except olfaction. In the thalamus, the magnocellular and parvocellular distinctions remain intact, and there are different layers of the thalamus dedicated to each. When visual signals leave the thalamus, they travel to the primary visual cortex at the rear of the brain. From the visual cortex, the visual signals travel in two directions. One stream that projects to the parietal lobe, in the side of the brain, carries magnocellular (“where”) information. A second stream projects to the temporal lobe and carries both magnocellular (“where”) and parvocellular (“what”) information.</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp5649760"></span>Another important visual route is a pathway from the retina to the <span id="m44761-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1831512"></span><strong>superior colliculus</strong> in the midbrain, where eye movements are coordinated and integrated with auditory information. Finally, there is the pathway from the retina to the <span id="m44761-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1831517"></span><strong>suprachiasmatic nucleus</strong> (SCN) of the hypothalamus. The SCN is a cluster of cells that is considered to be the body’s internal clock, which controls our <strong><span id="m44761-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1831522"></span>circadian</strong> (day-long) cycle.

Light waves differ based on their frequency (wavelength = hue) and amplitude (intensity = brightness).</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp30108000"></span>In the vertebrate retina, there are two types of light receptors (photoreceptors): cones and rods. Cones, which are the source of color vision, exist in three forms—L, M, and S—and they are differentially sensitive to different wavelengths. Cones are located in the retina, along with the dim-light, achromatic receptors (rods). Cones are found in the fovea, the central region of the retina, whereas rods are found in the peripheral regions of the retina.</p> <p><span id="m44761-fs-idp69177296"></span>Visual signals travel from the eye over the axons of retinal ganglion cells, which make up the optic nerves. Ganglion cells come in several versions. Some ganglion cell axons carry information on form, movement, depth, and brightness, while other axons carry information on color and fine detail. Visual information is sent to the superior colliculi in the midbrain, where coordination of eye movements and integration of auditory information takes place. Visual information is also sent to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which plays a role in the circadian cycle.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about mechanoreceptors is false? <ol><li>Pacini corpuscles are found in both glabrous and hairy skin.</li> <li>Merkel’s disks are abundant on the fingertips and lips.</li> <li>Ruffini endings are encapsulated mechanoreceptors.</li> <li>Meissner’s corpuscles extend into the lower dermis.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44761-fs-idp4420208">Why do people over 55 often need reading glasses?</span> <ol><li>Their cornea no longer focuses correctly.</li> <li>Their lens no longer focuses correctly.</li> <li>Their eyeball has elongated with age, causing images to focus in front of their retina.</li> <li>Their retina has thinned with age, making vision more difficult.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44761-fs-idp47635056">Why is it easier to see images at night using peripheral, rather than the central, vision?</span> <ol><li>Cones are denser in the periphery of the retina.</li> <li>Bipolar cells are denser in the periphery of the retina.</li> <li>Rods are denser in the periphery of the retina.</li> <li>The optic nerve exits at the periphery of the retina.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44761-fs-idm100375248"><span id="m44761-fs-idp25394608"></span>A person catching a ball must coordinate her head and eyes.

The endocrine system plays a role in growth, metabolism, and sexual development. In humans, common endocrine system diseases include thyroid disease and diabetes mellitus. In organisms that undergo metamorphosis, the process is controlled by the endocrine system. The transformation from tadpole to frog, for example, is complex and nuanced to adapt to specific environments and ecological circumstances.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Communication between neighboring cells, and between cells and tissues in distant parts of the body, occurs through the release of chemicals called hormones. Hormones are released into body fluids (usually blood) that carry these chemicals to their target cells. At the target cells, which are cells that have a receptor for a signal or ligand from a signal cell, the hormones elicit a response. The cells, tissues, and organs that secrete hormones make up the endocrine system. Examples of glands of the endocrine system include the adrenal glands, which produce hormones such as epinephrine and norepinephrine that regulate responses to stress, and the thyroid gland, which produces thyroid hormones that regulate metabolic rates.</p> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp213417824"></span>Although there are many different hormones in the human body, they can be divided into three classes based on their chemical structure: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide (peptide and proteins) hormones. One of the key distinguishing features of lipid-derived hormones is that they can diffuse across plasma membranes whereas the amino acid-derived and peptide hormones cannot.</p> <div class="section" title="Lipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44766-fs-idp127604400"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Lipid-Derived Hormones (or Lipid-soluble Hormones)</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp278651712"></span>Most <span id="m44766-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1834521"></span><strong>lipid hormones</strong> are derived from cholesterol and thus are structurally similar to it, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;37.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1217" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/18-1-types-of-hormones/#attachment_1217">Figure 18.2</a>. The primary class of lipid hormones in humans is the steroid hormones. Chemically, these hormones are usually ketones or alcohols; their chemical names will end in “-ol” for alcohols or “-one” for ketones. Examples of steroid hormones include estradiol, which is an <span id="m44766-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1834535"></span><strong>estrogen</strong>, or female sex hormone, and testosterone, which is an androgen, or male sex hormone. These two hormones are released by the female and male reproductive organs, respectively. Other steroid hormones include aldosterone and cortisol, which are released by the adrenal glands along with some other types of androgens. Steroid hormones are insoluble in water, and they are transported by transport proteins in blood. As a result, they remain in circulation longer than peptide hormones. For example, cortisol has a half-life of 60 to 90 minutes, while epinephrine, an amino acid derived-hormone, has a half-life of approximately one minute.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1217" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1217" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_01_01abc.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_01_01abc.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4926" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc.jpg" alt="Figure_37_01_01abc" width="500" height="387" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc.jpg 757w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc-300x232.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc-65x50.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc-225x174.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_37_01_01abc-350x271.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1217">Figure 18.2.&nbsp; The structures shown here represent (a) cholesterol, plus the steroid hormones (b) testosterone and (c) estradiol.</div></div> <div class="section" title="Amino Acid-Derived Hormones"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44766-fs-idm49172336"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Amino Acid-Derived Hormones</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp229009568"></span>The <span id="m44766-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1827628"></span><strong>amino acid-derived hormones </strong>are relatively small molecules that are derived from the amino acids tyrosine and tryptophan, shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;37.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1218" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/18-1-types-of-hormones/#attachment_1218">Figure 18.3</a>.

Some of the diseases that are managed by endocrinologists: disorders of the pancreas (diabetes mellitus), disorders of the pituitary (gigantism, acromegaly, and pituitary dwarfism), disorders of the thyroid gland (goiter and Graves’ disease), and disorders of the adrenal glands (Cushing’s disease and Addison’s disease).</p> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp212309904"></span>Endocrinologists are required to assess patients and diagnose endocrine disorders through extensive use of laboratory tests. Many endocrine diseases are diagnosed using tests that stimulate or suppress endocrine organ functioning. Blood samples are then drawn to determine the effect of stimulating or suppressing an endocrine organ on the production of hormones. For example, to diagnose diabetes mellitus, patients are required to fast for 12 to 24 hours. They are then given a sugary drink, which stimulates the pancreas to produce insulin to decrease blood glucose levels. A blood sample is taken one to two hours after the sugar drink is consumed. If the pancreas is functioning properly, the blood glucose level will be within a normal range. Another example is the A1C test, which can be performed during blood screening. The A1C test measures average blood glucose levels over the past two to three months by examining how well the blood glucose is being managed over a long time.</p> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp15296112"></span>Once a disease has been diagnosed, endocrinologists can prescribe lifestyle changes and/or medications to treat the disease. Some cases of diabetes mellitus can be managed by exercise, weight loss, and a healthy diet; in other cases, medications may be required to enhance insulin release. If the disease cannot be controlled by these means, the endocrinologist may prescribe insulin injections.</p> <p><span id="m44766-fs-idp229970096"></span>In addition to clinical practice, endocrinologists may also be involved in primary research and development activities. For example, ongoing islet transplant research is investigating how healthy pancreas islet cells may be transplanted into diabetic patients. Successful islet transplants may allow patients to stop taking insulin injections.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>There are three basic types of hormones: lipid-derived, amino acid-derived, and peptide. Lipid-derived hormones are structurally similar to cholesterol and include steroid hormones such as estradiol and testosterone. Amino acid-derived hormones are relatively small molecules and include the adrenal hormones epinephrine and norepinephrine. Peptide hormones are polypeptide chains or proteins and include the pituitary hormones, antidiuretic hormone (vasopressin), and oxytocin.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li><span id="m44766-fs-idp27103808">A newly discovered hormone contains four amino acids linked together.

In this way, even though hormones circulate throughout the body and come into contact with many different cell types, they only affect cells that possess the necessary receptors. Receptors for a specific hormone may be found on many different cells or may be limited to a small number of specialized cells. For example, thyroid hormones act on many different tissue types, stimulating metabolic activity throughout the body. Cells can have many receptors for the same hormone but often also possess receptors for different types of hormones. The number of receptors that respond to a hormone determines the cell’s sensitivity to that hormone, and the resulting cellular response. Additionally, the number of receptors that respond to a hormone can change over time, resulting in increased or decreased cell sensitivity. In <span id="m44768-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1829914"></span><strong>up-regulation</strong>, the number of receptors increases in response to rising hormone levels, making the cell more sensitive to the hormone and allowing for more cellular activity.

Once outside the cell, they bind to transport proteins that keep them soluble in the bloodstream. At the target cell, the hormones are released from the carrier protein and diffuse across the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane of cells. The steroid hormones pass through the plasma membrane of a target cell and adhere to intracellular receptors residing in the cytoplasm or in the nucleus. The cell signaling pathways induced by the steroid hormones regulate specific genes on the cell’s DNA. The hormones and receptor complex act as transcription regulators by increasing or decreasing the synthesis of mRNA molecules of specific genes. This, in turn, determines the amount of corresponding protein that is synthesized by altering gene expression. This protein can be used either to change the structure of the cell or to produce enzymes that catalyze chemical reactions. In this way, the steroid hormone regulates specific cell processes as illustrated in Figure 18.5.</p> </div> <div id="m44768-fs-idp99897760" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1220" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1220" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_02_01.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_02_01.png"><img class="wp-image-4931" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1.png" alt="Figure_37_02_01" width="500" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1-300x180.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1-768x461.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1-65x39.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1-225x135.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_02_01-1024x615-1-350x210.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1220">Figure 18.5.&nbsp; An intracellular nuclear receptor (NR) is located in the cytoplasm bound to a heat shock protein (HSP).

When a hormone is not bound to the receptor, the G-protein is inactive and is bound to guanosine diphosphate, or GDP. When a hormone binds to the receptor, the G-protein is activated by binding guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, in place of GDP. After binding, GTP is hydrolysed by the G-protein into GDP and becomes inactive.</p> <p><span id="m44768-fs-idp260294208"></span>The activated G-protein in turn activates a membrane-bound enzyme called <strong><span id="m44768-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1823018"></span>adenylyl cyclase</strong>. Adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. cAMP, in turn, activates a group of proteins called protein kinases, which transfer a phosphate group from ATP to a substrate molecule in a process called phosphorylation.

These activated molecules can then mediate changes in cellular processes.</p> <p><span id="m44768-fs-idp54512752"></span>The effect of a hormone is amplified as the signaling pathway progresses. The binding of a hormone at a single receptor causes the activation of many G-proteins, which activates adenylyl cyclase. Each molecule of adenylyl cyclase then triggers the formation of many molecules of cAMP. Further amplification occurs as protein kinases, once activated by cAMP, can catalyze many reactions. In this way, a small amount of hormone can trigger the formation of a large amount of cellular product. To stop hormone activity, cAMP is deactivated by the cytoplasmic enzyme <span id="m44768-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1823036"></span><strong>phosphodiesterase</strong>, or PDE.

The water concentration of the body is monitored by <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295480"></span><strong>osmoreceptors</strong> in the hypothalamus, which detect the concentration of electrolytes in the extracellular fluid. The concentration of electrolytes in the blood rises when there is water loss caused by excessive perspiration, inadequate water intake, or low blood volume due to blood loss. An increase in blood electrolyte levels results in a neuronal signal being sent from the osmoreceptors in hypothalamic nuclei. The pituitary gland has two components: anterior and posterior. The anterior pituitary is composed of glandular cells that secrete protein hormones. The posterior pituitary is an extension of the hypothalamus. It is composed largely of neurons that are continuous with the hypothalamus.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idm523184"></span>The hypothalamus produces a polypeptide hormone known as <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295495"></span><strong>antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</strong>, which is transported to and released from the posterior pituitary gland. The principal action of ADH is to regulate the amount of water excreted by the kidneys. As ADH (which is also known as vasopressin) causes direct water reabsorption from the kidney tubules, salts and wastes are concentrated in what will eventually be excreted as urine. The hypothalamus controls the mechanisms of ADH secretion, either by regulating blood volume or the concentration of water in the blood. Dehydration or physiological stress can cause an increase of osmolarity above 300 mOsm/L, which in turn, raises ADH secretion and water will be retained, causing an increase in blood pressure. ADH travels in the bloodstream to the kidneys. Once at the kidneys, ADH changes the kidneys to become more permeable to water by temporarily inserting water channels, aquaporins, into the kidney tubules. Water moves out of the kidney tubules through the aquaporins, reducing urine volume. The water is reabsorbed into the capillaries lowering blood osmolarity back toward normal. As blood osmolarity decreases, a negative feedback mechanism reduces osmoreceptor activity in the hypothalamus, and ADH secretion is reduced. ADH release can be reduced by certain substances, including alcohol, which can cause increased urine production and dehydration.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp89776"></span>Chronic underproduction of ADH or a mutation in the ADH receptor results in <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295515"></span><strong>diabetes insipidus</strong>. If the posterior pituitary does not release enough ADH, water cannot be retained by the kidneys and is lost as urine. This causes increased thirst, but water taken in is lost again and must be continually consumed. If the condition is not severe, dehydration may not occur, but severe cases can lead to electrolyte imbalances due to dehydration.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp8080016"></span>Another hormone responsible for maintaining electrolyte concentrations in extracellular fluids is <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295530"></span><strong>aldosterone</strong>, a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex. In contrast to ADH, which promotes the reabsorption of water to maintain proper water balance, aldosterone maintains proper water balance by enhancing Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption and K<sup>+</sup> secretion from extracellular fluid of the cells in kidney tubules. Because it is produced in the cortex of the adrenal gland and affects the concentrations of minerals Na<sup>+ </sup>and K<sup>+</sup>, aldosterone is referred to as a <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295551"></span><strong>mineralocorticoid</strong>, a corticosteroid that affects ion and water balance. Aldosterone release is stimulated by a decrease in blood sodium levels, blood volume, or blood pressure, or an increase in blood potassium levels. It also prevents the loss of Na<sup>+</sup> from sweat, saliva, and gastric juice.

Renin, an enzyme, circulates in the blood and reacts with a plasma protein produced by the liver called angiotensinogen. When angiotensinogen is cleaved by renin, it produces angiotensin I, which is then converted into angiotensin II in the lungs. Angiotensin II functions as a hormone and then causes the release of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal cortex, resulting in increased Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption, water retention, and an increase in blood pressure. Angiotensin II in addition to being a potent vasoconstrictor also causes an increase in ADH and increased thirst, both of which help to raise blood pressure.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1222" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1222" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_03_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_03_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4935" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_37_03_01-1024x554-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;37.7.&nbsp; ADH and aldosterone increase blood pressure and volume.

During puberty in both males and females, the hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which stimulates the production and release of <strong><span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377428"></span>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</strong> and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland. These hormones regulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) and therefore are called <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377434"></span><strong>gonadotropins</strong>. In both males and females, FSH stimulates gamete production and LH stimulates production of hormones by the gonads.

Anabolic steroids, a form of the male sex hormone testosterone, are one of the most widely known performance-enhancing drugs. Steroids are used to help build muscle mass. Other hormones that are used to enhance athletic performance include erythropoietin, which triggers the production of red blood cells, and human growth hormone, which can help in building muscle mass. Most performance enhancing drugs are illegal for non-medical purposes. They are also banned by national and international governing bodies including the International Olympic Committee, the U.S. Olympic Committee, the National Collegiate Athletic Association, the Major League Baseball, and the National Football League.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7859120"></span>The side effects of synthetic hormones are often significant and non-reversible, and in some cases, fatal. Androgens produce several complications such as liver dysfunctions and liver tumors, prostate gland enlargement, difficulty urinating, premature closure of epiphyseal cartilages, testicular atrophy, infertility, and immune system depression. The physiological strain caused by these substances is often greater than what the body can handle, leading to unpredictable and dangerous effects and linking their use to heart attacks, strokes, and impaired cardiac function.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Regulation of the Female Reproductive System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44777-fs-idp393904"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Regulation of the Female Reproductive System</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idm212464"></span>In females, FSH stimulates development of egg cells, called ova, which develop in structures called follicles.

Oxytocin also stimulates the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the milk-producing mammary glands. As these cells contract, milk is forced from the secretory alveoli into milk ducts and is ejected from the breasts in milk ejection (“let-down”) reflex.

In order to manage nutrient intake, storing excess intake and utilizing reserves when necessary, the body uses hormones to moderate energy stores. <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377661"></span><strong>Insulin</strong> is produced by the beta cells of the pancreas, which are stimulated to release insulin as blood glucose levels rise (for example, after a meal is consumed). Insulin lowers blood glucose levels by enhancing the rate of glucose uptake and utilization by target cells, which use glucose for ATP production. It also stimulates the liver to convert glucose to glycogen, which is then stored by cells for later use. Insulin also increases glucose transport into certain cells, such as muscle cells and the liver. This results from an insulin-mediated increase in the number of glucose transporter proteins in cell membranes, which remove glucose from circulation by facilitated diffusion. As insulin binds to its target cell via insulin receptors and signal transduction, it triggers the cell to incorporate glucose transport proteins into its membrane. This allows glucose to enter the cell, where it can be used as an energy source. However, this does not occur in all cells: some cells, including those in the kidneys and brain, can access glucose without the use of insulin. Insulin also stimulates the conversion of glucose to fat in adipocytes and the synthesis of proteins. These actions mediated by insulin cause blood glucose concentrations to fall, called a hypoglycemic “low sugar” effect, which inhibits further insulin release from beta cells through a negative feedback loop.</p> <div id="m44777-fs-idp8228160" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44777-fs-idp382880"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/insulin.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idm212016"></span>This <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/insulin" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/insulin">animation</a> describe the role of insulin and the pancreas in diabetes.</p> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp8236880"></span>Impaired insulin function can lead to a condition called <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377724"></span><strong>diabetes mellitus</strong>, the main symptoms of which are illustrated in Figure 18.10. This can be caused by low levels of insulin production by the beta cells of the pancreas, or by reduced sensitivity of tissue cells to insulin. This prevents glucose from being absorbed by cells, causing high levels of blood glucose, or <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377737"></span><strong>hyperglycemia</strong> (high sugar). High blood glucose levels make it difficult for the kidneys to recover all the glucose from nascent urine, resulting in glucose being lost in urine. High glucose levels also result in less water being reabsorbed by the kidneys, causing high amounts of urine to be produced; this may result in dehydration. Over time, high blood glucose levels can cause nerve damage to the eyes and peripheral body tissues, as well as damage to the kidneys and cardiovascular system. Oversecretion of insulin can cause <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377745"></span><strong>hypoglycemia</strong>, low blood glucose levels. This causes insufficient glucose availability to cells, often leading to muscle weakness, and can sometimes cause unconsciousness or death if left untreated.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1226" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1226" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_37_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4939" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_37_03_04.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;37.10.&nbsp; The main symptoms of diabetes are shown.

These hormones affect nearly every cell in the body except for the adult brain, uterus, testes, blood cells, and spleen. They are transported across the plasma membrane of target cells and bind to receptors on the mitochondria resulting in increased ATP production. In the nucleus, T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>activate genes involved in energy production and glucose oxidation. This results in increased rates of metabolism and body heat production, which is known as the hormone’s calorigenic effect.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp10565344"></span>T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>release from the thyroid gland is stimulated by <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377949"></span><strong>thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)</strong>, which is produced by the anterior pituitary. TSH binding at the receptors of the follicle of the thyroid triggers the production of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> from a glycoprotein called <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1377961"></span><strong>thyroglobulin</strong>. Thyroglobulin is present in the follicles of the thyroid, and is converted into thyroid hormones with the addition of iodine. Iodine is formed from iodide ions that are actively transported into the thyroid follicle from the bloodstream. A peroxidase enzyme then attaches the iodine to the tyrosine amino acid found in thyroglobulin. T<sub>3</sub> has three iodine ions attached, while T<sub>4</sub> has four iodine ions attached. T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> are then released into the bloodstream, with T<sub>4</sub> being released in much greater amounts than T<sub>3</sub>. As T<sub>3</sub> is more active than T<sub>4</sub> and is responsible for most of the effects of thyroid hormones, tissues of the body convert T<sub>4</sub> to T<sub>3</sub> by the removal of an iodine ion. Most of the released T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>becomes attached to transport proteins in the bloodstream and is unable to cross the plasma membrane of cells. These protein-bound molecules are only released when blood levels of the unattached hormone begin to decline. In this way, a week’s worth of reserve hormone is maintained in the blood. Increased T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>levels in the blood inhibit the release of TSH, which results in lower T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>release from the thyroid.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7990160"></span>The follicular cells of the thyroid require iodides (anions of iodine) in order to synthesize T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4</sub>. Iodides obtained from the diet are actively transported into follicle cells resulting in a concentration that is approximately 30 times higher than in blood. The typical diet in North America provides more iodine than required due to the addition of iodide to table salt. Inadequate iodine intake, which occurs in many developing countries, results in an inability to synthesize T<sub>3 </sub>and T<sub>4 </sub>hormones. The thyroid gland enlarges in a condition called <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295874"></span><strong>goiter</strong>, which is caused by overproduction of TSH without the formation of thyroid hormone. Thyroglobulin is contained in a fluid called colloid, and TSH stimulation results in higher levels of colloid accumulation in the thyroid. In the absence of iodine, this is not converted to thyroid hormone, and colloid begins to accumulate more and more in the thyroid gland, leading to goiter.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp372656"></span>Disorders can arise from both the underproduction and overproduction of thyroid hormones. <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295886"></span><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong>, underproduction of the thyroid hormones, can cause a low metabolic rate leading to weight gain, sensitivity to cold, and reduced mental activity, among other symptoms. In children, hypothyroidism can cause cretinism, which can lead to mental retardation and growth defects. <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1295892"></span><strong>Hyperthyroidism</strong>, the overproduction of thyroid hormones, can lead to an increased metabolic rate and its effects: weight loss, excess heat production, sweating, and an increased heart rate.

Stressors are stimuli that disrupt homeostasis. The sympathetic division of the vertebrate autonomic nervous system has evolved the fight-or-flight response to counter stress-induced disruptions of homeostasis. In the initial alarm phase, the sympathetic nervous system stimulates an increase in energy levels through increased blood glucose levels. This prepares the body for physical activity that may be required to respond to stress: to either fight for survival or to flee from danger.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7979328"></span>However, some stresses, such as illness or injury, can last for a long time. Glycogen reserves, which provide energy in the short-term response to stress, are exhausted after several hours and cannot meet long-term energy needs. If glycogen reserves were the only energy source available, neural functioning could not be maintained once the reserves became depleted due to the nervous system’s high requirement for glucose. In this situation, the body has evolved a response to counter long-term stress through the actions of the glucocorticoids, which ensure that long-term energy requirements can be met. The glucocorticoids mobilize lipid and protein reserves, stimulate gluconeogenesis, conserve glucose for use by neural tissue, and stimulate the conservation of salts and water. The mechanisms to maintain homeostasis that are described here are those observed in the human body. However, the fight-or-flight response exists in some form in all vertebrates.</p> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7979840"></span>The sympathetic nervous system regulates the stress response via the hypothalamus. Stressful stimuli cause the hypothalamus to signal the adrenal medulla (which mediates short-term stress responses) via nerve impulses, and the adrenal cortex, which mediates long-term stress responses, via the hormone <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296191"></span><strong>adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</strong>, which is produced by the anterior pituitary.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Short-term Stress Response"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44777-fs-idp7983616"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Short-term Stress Response</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7984256"></span>When presented with a stressful situation, the body responds by calling for the release of hormones that provide a burst of energy. The hormones <strong><span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296209"></span>epinephrine</strong> (also known as adrenaline) and <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296212"></span><strong>norepinephrine</strong> (also known as noradrenaline) are released by the adrenal medulla. How do these hormones provide a burst of energy? Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase blood glucose levels by stimulating the liver and skeletal muscles to break down glycogen and by stimulating glucose release by liver cells. Additionally, these hormones increase oxygen availability to cells by increasing the heart rate and dilating the bronchioles. The hormones also prioritize body function by increasing blood supply to essential organs such as the heart, brain, and skeletal muscles, while restricting blood flow to organs not in immediate need, such as the skin, digestive system, and kidneys. Epinephrine and norepinephrine are collectively called catecholamines.</p> <div id="m44777-fs-idp1816672" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44777-fs-idp365648"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/adrenaline.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp11954800"></span>Watch this</p> </div> </div> <p><a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenaline" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/adrenaline">Discovery Channel animation</a> describing the flight-or-flight response.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Long-term Stress Response"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44777-fs-idp7868032"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Long-term Stress Response</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7868720"></span>Long-term stress response differs from short-term stress response. The body cannot sustain the bursts of energy mediated by epinephrine and norepinephrine for long times. Instead, other hormones come into play. In a long-term stress response, the hypothalamus triggers the release of ACTH from the anterior pituitary gland. The adrenal cortex is stimulated by ACTH to release steroid hormones called <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296282"></span><strong>corticosteroids</strong>. Corticosteroids turn on transcription of certain genes in the nuclei of target cells. They change enzyme concentrations in the cytoplasm and affect cellular metabolism. There are two main corticosteroids: glucocorticoids such as <strong><span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296288"></span>cortisol</strong>, and mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone. These hormones target the breakdown of fat into fatty acids in the adipose tissue. The fatty acids are released into the bloodstream for other tissues to use for ATP production. The <span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296293"></span><strong>glucocorticoids</strong> primarily affect glucose metabolism by stimulating glucose synthesis. Glucocorticoids also have anti-inflammatory properties through inhibition of the immune system. For example, cortisone is used as an anti-inflammatory medication; however, it cannot be used long term as it increases susceptibility to disease due to its immune-suppressing effects.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp7866256"></span>Mineralocorticoids function to regulate ion and water balance of the body. The hormone aldosterone stimulates the reabsorption of water and sodium ions in the kidney, which results in increased blood pressure and volume.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp11949600"></span>Hypersecretion of glucocorticoids can cause a condition known as <strong><span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296313"></span>Cushing’s disease</strong>, characterized by a shifting of fat storage areas of the body. This can cause the accumulation of adipose tissue in the face and neck, and excessive glucose in the blood.

Underproduction of ADH can cause diabetes insipidus. Aldosterone, a hormone produced by the adrenal cortex of the kidneys, enhances Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption from the extracellular fluids and subsequent water reabsorption by diffusion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system is one way that aldosterone release is controlled.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp374576"></span>The reproductive system is controlled by the gonadotropins follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH), which are produced by the pituitary gland. Gonadotropin release is controlled by the hypothalamic hormone gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH).

FSH stimulates egg maturation in females, while LH stimulates the production of estrogens and progesterone. <em class="glossterm"><span id="m44777-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1296359"></span>Estrogens</em> are a group of steroid hormones produced by the ovaries that trigger the development of secondary sex characteristics in females as well as control the maturation of the ova. In females, the pituitary also produces prolactin, which stimulates milk production after childbirth, and oxytocin, which stimulates uterine contraction during childbirth and milk let-down during suckling.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp379472"></span>Insulin is produced by the pancreas in response to rising blood glucose levels and allows cells to utilize blood glucose and store excess glucose for later use. Diabetes mellitus is caused by reduced insulin activity and causes high blood glucose levels, or hyperglycemia. Glucagon is released by the pancreas in response to low blood glucose levels and stimulates the breakdown of glycogen into glucose, which can be used by the body. The body’s basal metabolic rate is controlled by the thyroid hormones thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub>) and triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub>). The anterior pituitary produces thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), which controls the release of T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> from the thyroid gland. Iodine is necessary in the production of thyroid hormone, and the lack of iodine can lead to a condition called goiter.</p> <p><span id="m44777-fs-idp377520"></span>Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is produced by the parathyroid glands in response to low blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.

Short-term stress causes the hypothalamus to trigger the adrenal medulla to release epinephrine and norepinephrine, which trigger the fight or flight response.

Prolactin stimulates the production of milk by the mammary glands following childbirth. Prolactin levels are regulated by the hypothalamic hormones prolactin-releasing hormone (PRH) and prolactin-inhibiting hormone (PIH) which is now known to be dopamine. PRH stimulates the release of prolactin and PIH inhibits it. The posterior pituitary releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates contractions during childbirth. The uterine smooth muscles are not very sensitive to oxytocin until late in pregnancy when the number of oxytocin receptors in the uterus peaks. Stretching of tissues in the uterus and vagina stimulates oxytocin release in childbirth. Contractions increase in intensity as blood levels of oxytocin rise until the birth is complete.</li> <li>Hormonal regulation is required for the growth and replication of most cells in the body.

The GH mediated increase in blood glucose levels is called a diabetogenic effect because it is similar to the high blood glucose levels seen in diabetes mellitus.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section module" title="37.5.&nbsp;Endocrine Glands" xml:lang="en"><div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <dl><dt><strong>Addison’s disease</strong></dt> <dd>disorder caused by the hyposecretion of corticosteroids</dd> <dt><strong>acromegaly</strong></dt> <dd>condition caused by overproduction of GH in adults</dd> <dt><strong>adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)</strong></dt> <dd>hormone released by the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the adrenal cortex to release corticosteroids during the long-term stress response</dd> <dt><strong>aldosterone</strong></dt> <dd>steroid hormone produced by the adrenal cortex that stimulates the reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> from extracellular fluids and secretion of K<sup>+</sup>.</dd> <dt><strong>androgen</strong></dt> <dd>male sex hormone such as testosterone</dd> <dt><strong>antidiuretic hormone (ADH)</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the hypothalamus and released by the posterior pituitary that increases water reabsorption by the kidneys</dd> <dt><strong>calcitonin</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland that functions to lower blood Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and promote bone growth</dd> <dt><strong>corticosteroid</strong></dt> <dd>hormone released by the adrenal cortex in response to long-term stress</dd> <dt><strong>cortisol</strong></dt> <dd>glucocorticoid produced in response to stress</dd> <dt><strong>Cushing’s disease</strong></dt> <dd>disorder caused by the hypersecretion of glucocorticoids</dd> <dt><strong>diabetes insipidus</strong></dt> <dd>disorder caused by underproduction of ADH</dd> <dt><strong>diabetes mellitus</strong></dt> <dd>disorder caused by low levels of insulin activity</dd> <dt><strong>diabetogenic effect</strong></dt> <dd>effect of GH that causes blood glucose levels to rise similar to diabetes mellitus</dd> <dt><strong>epinephrine</strong></dt> <dd>hormone released by the adrenal medulla in response to a short term stress</dd> <dt><strong>follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the anterior pituitary that stimulates gamete production</dd> <dt><strong>gigantism</strong></dt> <dd>condition caused by overproduction of GH in children</dd> <dt><strong>glucagon</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the alpha cells of the pancreas in response to low blood sugar;

The hypothalamus is an endocrine organ located in the diencephalon of the brain. It receives input from the body and other brain areas and initiates endocrine responses to environmental changes. The hypothalamus acts as an endocrine organ, synthesizing hormones and transporting them along axons to the posterior pituitary gland. It synthesizes and secretes regulatory hormones that control the endocrine cells in the anterior pituitary gland.

The anterior portion of the pituitary gland is regulated by releasing or release-inhibiting hormones produced by the hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary receives signals via neurosecretory cells to release hormones produced by the hypothalamus. The pituitary has two distinct regions—the anterior pituitary and the posterior pituitary—which between them secrete nine different peptide or protein hormones.

Anterior pituitary hormones are sometimes referred to as tropic hormones, because they control the functioning of other organs. While these hormones are produced by the anterior pituitary, their production is controlled by regulatory hormones produced by the hypothalamus. These regulatory hormones can be releasing hormones or inhibiting hormones, causing more or less of the anterior pituitary hormones to be secreted. These travel from the hypothalamus through the hypophyseal portal system to the anterior pituitary where they exert their effect.

These include the heart, kidneys, intestines, thymus, gonads, and adipose tissue.</p> <p><span id="m44775-fs-idm38972832"></span>The heart possesses endocrine cells in the walls of the atria that are specialized cardiac muscle cells. These cells release the hormone <span id="m44775-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1389982"></span><strong>atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)</strong><a id="id799338" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> in response to increased blood volume. High blood volume causes the cells to be stretched, resulting in hormone release. ANP acts on the kidneys to reduce the reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup>, causing Na<sup>+</sup> and water to be excreted in the urine. ANP also reduces the amounts of renin released by the kidneys and aldosterone released by the adrenal cortex, further preventing the retention of water. In this way, ANP causes a reduction in blood volume and blood pressure, and reduces the concentration of Na<sup>+</sup> in the blood.</p> <p><span id="m44775-fs-idp8486624"></span>The gastrointestinal tract produces several hormones that aid in digestion. The endocrine cells are located in the mucosa of the GI tract throughout the stomach and small intestine. Some of the hormones produced include gastrin, secretin, and cholecystokinin, which are secreted in the presence of food, and some of which act on other organs such as the pancreas, gallbladder, and liver. They trigger the release of gastric juices, which help to break down and digest food in the GI tract.</p> <p><span id="m44775-fs-idp117388800"></span>While the adrenal glands associated with the kidneys are major <span id="m44775-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1390016"></span><strong>endocrine glands</strong><a id="id799385" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, the kidneys themselves also possess endocrine function. Renin is released in response to decreased blood volume or pressure and is part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that leads to the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone then causes the retention of Na<sup>+</sup> and water, raising blood volume. The kidneys also release calcitriol, which aids in the absorption of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and phosphate ions. <span id="m44775-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1390031"></span><strong>Erythropoietin (EPO)</strong><a id="id799409" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is a protein hormone that triggers the formation of red blood cells in the bone marrow. EPO is released in response to low oxygen levels. Because red blood cells are oxygen carriers, increased production results in greater oxygen delivery throughout the body. EPO has been used by athletes to improve performance, as greater oxygen delivery to muscle cells allows for greater endurance. Because red blood cells increase the viscosity of blood, artificially high levels of EPO can cause severe health risks.</p> <p><span id="m44775-fs-idp52508320"></span>The <span id="m44775-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1390043"></span><strong>thymus</strong><a id="id799432" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is found behind the sternum; it is most prominent in infants, becoming smaller in size through adulthood.

It produces the hormone <span id="m44775-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1390056"></span><strong>leptin</strong><a id="id799456" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> in response to food intake. Leptin increases the activity of anorexigenic neurons and decreases that of orexigenic neurons, producing a feeling of satiety after eating, thus affecting appetite and reducing the urge for further eating. Leptin is also associated with reproduction. It must be present for GnRH and gonadotropin synthesis to occur. Extremely thin females may enter puberty late; however, if adipose levels increase, more leptin will be produced, improving fertility.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <div class="cnx-eoc summary"><div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><p><span id="m44775-fs-idm44954272"></span>The pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain and is attached to the hypothalamus by the infundibulum.

Epinephrine is the primary adrenal medulla hormone accounting for 75–80 percent of its secretions. Epinephrine and norepinephrine increase heart rate, breathing rate, cardiac muscle contractions, and blood glucose levels. They also accelerate the breakdown of glucose in skeletal muscles and stored fats in adipose tissue. The release of epinephrine and norepinephrine is stimulated by neural impulses from the sympathetic nervous system. These neural impulses originate from the hypothalamus in response to stress to prepare the body for the fight-or-flight response.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <dl><dt><strong>adrenal cortex</strong></dt> <dd>outer portion of adrenal glands that produces corticosteroids</dd> <dt><strong>adrenal gland</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine glands associated with the kidneys</dd> <dt><strong>adrenal medulla</strong></dt> <dd>inner portion of adrenal glands that produces epinephrine and norepinephrine</dd> <dt><strong>alpha cell</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone glucagon</dd> <dt><strong>anterior pituitary</strong></dt> <dd>portion of the pituitary gland that produces six hormones; also called adenohypophysis</dd> <dt><strong>atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP)</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the heart to reduce blood volume, pressure, and Na<sup>+</sup> concentration</dd> <dt><strong>beta cell</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine cell of the pancreatic islets that produces the hormone insulin</dd> <dt><strong>colloid</strong></dt> <dd>fluid inside the thyroid gland that contains the glycoprotein thyroglobulin</dd> <dt><strong>endocrine gland</strong></dt> <dd>gland that secretes hormones into the surrounding interstitial fluid, which then diffuse into blood and are carried to various organs and tissues within the body</dd> <dt><strong>erythropoietin (EPO)</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by the kidneys to stimulate red blood cell production in the bone marrow</dd> <dt><strong>hypophyseal portal system</strong></dt> <dd>system of blood vessels that carries hormones from the hypothalamus to the anterior pituitary</dd> <dt><strong>islets of Langerhans (pancreatic islets)</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine cells of the pancreas</dd> <dt><strong>isthmus</strong></dt> <dd>tissue mass that connects the two lobes of the thyroid gland</dd> <dt><strong>leptin</strong></dt> <dd>hormone produced by adipose tissue that promotes feelings of satiety and reduces hunger</dd> <dt><strong>pancreas</strong></dt> <dd>organ located between the stomach and the small intestine that contains exocrine and endocrine cells</dd> <dt><strong>parafollicular cell</strong></dt> <dd>thyroid cell that produces the hormone calcitonin</dd> <dt><strong>parathyroid gland</strong></dt> <dd>gland located on the surface of the thyroid that produces parathyroid hormone</dd> <dt><strong>pituitary gland</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine gland located at the base of the brain composed of an anterior and posterior region; also called hypophysis</dd> <dt><strong>pituitary stalk</strong></dt> <dd>(also, infundibulum) stalk that connects the pituitary gland to the hypothalamus</dd> <dt><strong>posterior pituitary</strong></dt> <dd>extension of the brain that releases hormones produced by the hypothalamus; along with the infundibulum, it is also referred to as the neurohypophysis</dd> <dt><strong>thymus</strong></dt> <dd>gland located behind the sternum that produces thymosin hormones that contribute to the development of the immune system</dd> <dt><strong>thyroid gland</strong></dt> <dd>endocrine gland located in the neck that produces thyroid hormones thyroxine and triiodothyronine</dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div> </div></div>

The bones of the skeletal system protect the body’s internal organs and support the weight of the body. The muscles of the muscular system contract and pull on the bones, allowing for movements as diverse as standing, walking, running, and grasping items.</p> <p><span id="m44783-fs-idm26054656"></span>Injury or disease affecting the musculoskeletal system can be very debilitating. In humans, the most common musculoskeletal diseases worldwide are caused by malnutrition. Ailments that affect the joints are also widespread, such as arthritis, which can make movement difficult and—in advanced cases—completely impair mobility. In severe cases in which the joint has suffered extensive damage, joint replacement surgery may be needed.</p> <p><span id="m44783-fs-idm144496720"></span>Progress in the science of prosthesis design has resulted in the development of artificial joints, with joint replacement surgery in the hips and knees being the most common. Replacement joints for shoulders, elbows, and fingers are also available. Even with this progress, there is still room for improvement in the design of prostheses. The state-of-the-art prostheses have limited durability and therefore wear out quickly, particularly in young or active individuals. Current research is focused on the use of new materials, such as carbon fiber, that may make prostheses more durable.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

The organs of the coelom are supported by the aqueous fluid, which also resists external compression. This compartment is under hydrostatic pressure because of the fluid and supports the other organs of the organism. This type of skeletal system is found in soft-bodied animals such as sea anemones, earthworms, Cnidaria, and other invertebrates (Figure 19.2).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1240" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1240" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4960" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_38_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.2.&nbsp; The skeleton of the red-knobbed sea star (Protoreaster linckii) is an example of a hydrostatic skeleton.

The muscles in a hydrostatic skeleton contract to change the shape of the coelom; the pressure of the fluid in the coelom produces movement. For example, earthworms move by waves of muscular contractions of the skeletal muscle of the body wall hydrostatic skeleton, called peristalsis, which alternately shorten and lengthen the body. Lengthening the body extends the anterior end of the organism. Most organisms have a mechanism to fix themselves in the substrate. Shortening the muscles then draws the posterior portion of the body forward. Although a hydrostatic skeleton is well-suited to invertebrate organisms such as earthworms and some aquatic organisms, it is not an efficient skeleton for terrestrial animals.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Exoskeleton"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44781-fs-idp14522976"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Exoskeleton</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44781-fs-idm92889856"></span>An <span id="m44781-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1448830"></span><strong>exoskeleton</strong> is an external skeleton that consists of a hard encasement on the surface of an organism. For example, the shells of crabs and insects are exoskeletons (Figure 19.3). This skeleton type provides defence against predators, supports the body, and allows for movement through the contraction of attached muscles. As with vertebrates, muscles must cross a joint inside the exoskeleton. Shortening of the muscle changes the relationship of the two segments of the exoskeleton. Arthropods such as crabs and lobsters have exoskeletons that consist of 30–50 percent chitin, a polysaccharide derivative of glucose that is a strong but flexible material. Chitin is secreted by the epidermal cells. The exoskeleton is further strengthened by the addition of calcium carbonate in organisms such as the lobster. Because the exoskeleton is acellular, arthropods must periodically shed their exoskeletons because the exoskeleton does not grow as the organism grows.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1241" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1241" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_01_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_01_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4961" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.3.&nbsp; Muscles attached to the exoskeleton of the Halloween crab (Gecarcinus quadratus) allow it to move." width="400" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_01_02-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1241">Figure 19.3.&nbsp;<br />Muscles attached to the exoskeleton of the Halloween crab (Gecarcinus quadratus) allow it to move.</div></div> <div id="m44781-fig-ch38_01_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.3.&nbsp;"><div class="title"></div> </div> <div class="section" title="Endoskeleton"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44781-fs-idp74171488"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Endoskeleton</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44781-fs-idm113306112"></span>An <strong><span id="m44781-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1448895"></span>endoskeleton</strong> is a skeleton that consists of hard, mineralized structures located within the soft tissue of organisms.

The coccyx is typically 3–4 vertebrae that fuse into one. Around the age of 70, the sacrum and the coccyx may fuse together.

There is also a notch on each side through which the spinal nerves, which serve the body at that level, can exit from the spinal cord. The vertebral column is approximately 71 cm (28 inches) in adult male humans and is curved, which can be seen from a side view. The names of the spinal curves correspond to the region of the spine in which they occur. The thoracic and sacral curves are concave (curve inwards relative to the front of the body) and the cervical and lumbar curves are convex (curve outwards relative to the front of the body). The arched curvature of the vertebral column increases its strength and flexibility, allowing it to absorb shocks like a spring (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1247" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/19-1-types-of-skeletal-systems/#attachment_1247">Figure 19.8</a>).</p> <p><span id="m44781-fs-idm11353120"></span> <span id="m44781-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1406314"></span><strong>Intervertebral discs</strong><a id="id802955" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> composed of fibrous cartilage lie between adjacent vertebral bodies from the second cervical vertebra to the sacrum.

In adults, the hip bones, or <span id="m44781-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1419028"></span><strong>coxal bones</strong><a id="id803512" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> are formed by the fusion of three pairs of bones: the ilium, ischium, and pubis.

Over generations of evolution, females with a wider pubic angle and larger diameter pelvic canal reproduced more successfully.

The buoyancy of water provides a certain amount of lift, and a common form of movement by fish is lateral undulations of the entire body. This back and forth movement pushes the body against the water, creating forward movement. In most fish, the muscles of paired fins attach to girdles within the body, allowing for some control of locomotion. As certain fish began moving onto land, they retained their lateral undulation form of locomotion (anguilliform). However, instead of pushing against water, their fins or flippers became points of contact with the ground, around which they rotated their bodies.</p> <p><span id="m44781-fs-idm116370592"></span>The effect of gravity and the lack of buoyancy on land meant that body weight was suspended on the limbs, leading to increased strengthening and ossification of the limbs. The effect of gravity also required changes to the axial skeleton. Lateral undulations of land animal vertebral columns cause torsional strain. A firmer, more ossified vertebral column became common in terrestrial tetrapods because it reduces strain while providing the strength needed to support the body’s weight. In later tetrapods, the vertebrae began allowing for vertical motion rather than lateral flexion. Another change in the axial skeleton was the loss of a direct attachment between the pectoral girdle and the head. This reduced the jarring to the head caused by the impact of the limbs on the ground. The vertebrae of the neck also evolved to allow movement of the head independently of the body.</p> <p><span id="m44781-fs-idm153070864"></span>The appendicular skeleton of land animals is also different from aquatic animals. The shoulders attach to the pectoral girdle through muscles and connective tissue, thus reducing the jarring of the skull. Because of a lateral undulating vertebral column, in early tetrapods, the limbs were splayed out to the side and movement occurred by performing “push-ups.” The vertebrae of these animals had to move side-to-side in a similar manner to fish and reptiles. This type of motion requires large muscles to move the limbs toward the midline; it was almost like walking while doing push-ups, and it is not an efficient use of energy. Later tetrapods have their limbs placed under their bodies, so that each stride requires less force to move forward. This resulted in decreased adductor muscle size and an increased range of motion of the scapulae. This also restricts movement primarily to one plane, creating forward motion rather than moving the limbs upward as well as forward. The femur and humerus were also rotated, so that the ends of the limbs and digits were pointed forward, in the direction of motion, rather than out to the side. By placement underneath the body, limbs can swing forward like a pendulum to produce a stride that is more efficient for moving over land.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <div class="section"><div class="body"><p>The three types of skeleton designs are hydrostatic skeletons, exoskeletons, and endoskeletons. A hydrostatic skeleton is formed by a fluid-filled compartment held under hydrostatic pressure; movement is created by the muscles producing pressure on the fluid. An exoskeleton is a hard external skeleton that protects the outer surface of an organism and enables movement through muscles attached on the inside. An endoskeleton is an internal skeleton composed of hard, mineralized tissue that also enables movement by attachment to muscles. The human skeleton is an endoskeleton that is composed of the axial and appendicular skeleton. The axial skeleton is composed of the bones of the skull, ossicles of the ear, hyoid bone, vertebral column, and ribcage. The skull consists of eight cranial bones and 14 facial bones. Six bones make up the ossicles of the middle ear, while the hyoid bone is located in the neck under the mandible. The vertebral column contains 26 bones, and it surrounds and protects the spinal cord. The thoracic cage consists of the sternum, ribs, thoracic vertebrae, and costal cartilages. The appendicular skeleton is made up of the limbs of the upper and lower limbs. The pectoral girdle is composed of the clavicles and the scapulae. The upper limb contains 30 bones in the arm, the forearm, and the hand. The pelvic girdle attaches the lower limbs to the axial skeleton. The lower limb includes the bones of the thigh, the leg, and the foot.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about bone tissue is false? <ol><li>Compact bone tissue is made of cylindrical osteons that are aligned such that they travel the length of the bone.</li> <li>Haversian canals contain blood vessels only.</li> <li>Haversian canals contain blood vessels and nerve fibers.</li> <li>Spongy tissue is found on the interior of the bone, and compact bone tissue is found on the exterior.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The forearm consists of the: <ol><li>radius and ulna</li> <li>radius and humerus</li> <li>ulna and humerous</li> <li>humerus and carpus</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44781-fs-idm155699952">The pectoral girdle consists of the:</span> <ol><li>clavicle and sternum</li> <li>sternum and scapula</li> <li>clavicle and scapula</li> <li>clavicle and coccyx</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44781-fs-idp78230688"></span>All of the following are groups of vertebrae except ________, which is a curvature. <ol><li>thoracic</li> <li>cervical</li> <li>lumbar</li> <li>pelvic</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44781-fs-idm38742640">Which of these is a facial bone?</span> <ol><li>frontal</li> <li>occipital</li> <li>lacrimal</li> <li>temporal</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44781-fs-idm124905632">What are the major differences between the male pelvis and female pelvis that permit childbirth in females?</span></li> <li>What are the major differences between the pelvic girdle and the pectoral girdle that allow the pelvic girdle to bear the weight of the body?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>C</li> <li>D</li> <li>C</li> <li>The female pelvis is tilted forward and is wider, lighter, and shallower than the male pelvis.

Spongy bone is prominent in areas of bones that are not heavily stressed or where stresses arrive from many directions. The epiphyses of bones, such as the neck of the femur, are subject to stress from many directions. Imagine laying a heavy framed picture flat on the floor. You could hold up one side of the picture with a toothpick if the toothpick was perpendicular to the floor and the picture. Now drill a hole and stick the toothpick into the wall to hang up the picture. In this case, the function of the toothpick is to transmit the downward pressure of the picture to the wall. The force on the picture is straight down to the floor, but the force on the toothpick is both the picture wire pulling down and the bottom of the hole in the wall pushing up. The toothpick will break off right at the wall.</p> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idp54392224"></span>The neck of the femur is horizontal like the toothpick in the wall. The weight of the body pushes it down near the joint, but the vertical diaphysis of the femur pushes it up at the other end. The neck of the femur must be strong enough to transfer the downward force of the body weight horizontally to the vertical shaft of the femur (Figure 19.20).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1259" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1259" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_02_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_02_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4981" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.20.&nbsp; Trabeculae in spongy bone are arranged such that one side of the bone bears tension and the other withstands compression." width="300" height="290" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05-300x290.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05-65x63.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05-225x217.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_02_05-350x338.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1259">Figure 19.20.&nbsp;<br />Trabeculae in spongy bone are arranged such that one side of the bone bears tension and the other withstands compression.</div></div> <div id="m44789-fig-ch38_02_05" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.20.&nbsp;"><div id="m44789-fs-idm221406720" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44789-fs-idm203119296"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/muscle_tissue.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idp21378560"></span>View <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/muscle_tissue" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/muscle_tissue">micrographs</a> of musculoskeletal tissues as you review the anatomy.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Cell Types in Bones"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44789-fs-idm176180400"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cell Types in Bones</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idm202474080"></span>Bone consists of four types of cells: osteoblasts, osteoclasts, osteocytes, and osteoprogenitor cells. <span id="m44789-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1410999"></span><strong>Osteoblasts<a id="id805265" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a></strong> are bone cells that are responsible for bone formation. Osteoblasts synthesize and secrete the organic part and inorganic part of the extracellular matrix of bone tissue, and collagen fibers. Osteoblasts become trapped in these secretions and differentiate into less active osteocytes. <span id="m44789-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1411005"></span><strong>Osteoclasts<a id="id805281" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a></strong> are large bone cells with up to 50 nuclei. They remove bone structure by releasing lysosomal enzymes and acids that dissolve the bony matrix. These minerals, released from bones into the blood, help regulate calcium concentrations in body fluids. Bone may also be resorbed for remodeling, if the applied stresses have changed. <span id="m44789-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1411011"></span><strong>Osteocytes<a id="id805297" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a></strong> are mature bone cells and are the main cells in bony connective tissue; these cells cannot divide.

Ossification is distinct from the process of calcification; whereas calcification takes place during the ossification of bones, it can also occur in other tissues. Ossification begins approximately six weeks after fertilization in an embryo. Before this time, the embryonic skeleton consists entirely of fibrous membranes and hyaline cartilage. The development of bone from fibrous membranes is called intramembranous ossification; development from hyaline cartilage is called endochondral ossification. Bone growth continues until approximately age 25. Bones can grow in thickness throughout life, but after age 25, ossification functions primarily in bone remodeling and repair.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Intramembranous Ossification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44789-fs-idm174168672"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Intramembranous Ossification</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idm94647152"></span> <span id="m44789-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1441305"></span><strong>Intramembranous ossification</strong><a id="id805384" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. It is involved in the formation of the flat bones of the skull, the mandible, and the clavicles. Ossification begins as mesenchymal cells form a template of the future bone. They then differentiate into osteoblasts at the ossification center. Osteoblasts secrete the extracellular matrix and deposit calcium, which hardens the matrix. The non-mineralized portion of the bone or osteoid continues to form around blood vessels, forming spongy bone. Connective tissue in the matrix differentiates into red bone marrow in the fetus. The spongy bone is remodeled into a thin layer of compact bone on the surface of the spongy bone.</p> <div class="section" title="Endochondral Ossification"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44789-fs-idp5890240"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Endochondral Ossification</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idm73220656"></span> <span id="m44789-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1441328"></span><strong>Endochondral ossification</strong></p> </div> <p><a id="id805417" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage.

Responding to complex developmental signals, the matrix begins to calcify. This calcification prevents diffusion of nutrients into the matrix, resulting in chondrocytes dying and the opening up of cavities in the diaphysis cartilage. Blood vessels invade the cavities, and osteoblasts and osteoclasts modify the calcified cartilage matrix into spongy bone. Osteoclasts then break down some of the spongy bone to create a marrow, or medullary, cavity in the center of the diaphysis. Dense, irregular connective tissue forms a sheath (periosteum) around the bones. The periosteum assists in attaching the bone to surrounding tissues, tendons, and ligaments. The bone continues to grow and elongate as the cartilage cells at the epiphyses divide.</p> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idp83840768"></span>In the last stage of prenatal bone development, the centers of the epiphyses begin to calcify.

It involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Normal bone growth requires vitamins D, C, and A, plus minerals such as calcium, phosphorous, and magnesium. Hormones such as parathyroid hormone, growth hormone, and calcitonin are also required for proper bone growth and maintenance.</p> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idp30486048"></span>Bone turnover rates are quite high, with five to seven percent of bone mass being recycled every week. Differences in turnover rate exist in different areas of the skeleton and in different areas of a bone. For example, the bone in the head of the femur may be fully replaced every six months, whereas the bone along the shaft is altered much more slowly.</p> <p><span id="m44789-fs-idp37830768"></span>Bone remodeling allows bones to adapt to stresses by becoming thicker and stronger when subjected to stress. Bones that are not subject to normal stress, for example when a limb is in a cast, will begin to lose mass. A fractured or broken bone undergoes repair through four stages:</p> <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">Blood vessels in the broken bone tear and hemorrhage, resulting in the formation of clotted blood, or a hematoma, at the site of the break. The severed blood vessels at the broken ends of the bone are sealed by the clotting process, and bone cells that are deprived of nutrients begin to die.</li> <li class="listitem">Within days of the fracture, capillaries grow into the hematoma, and phagocytic cells begin to clear away the dead cells. Though fragments of the blood clot may remain, fibroblasts and osteoblasts enter the area and begin to reform bone. Fibroblasts produce collagen fibers that connect the broken bone ends, and osteoblasts start to form spongy bone. The repair tissue between the broken bone ends is called the fibrocartilaginous callus, as it is composed of both hyaline and fibrocartilage (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.22.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1262" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/19-2-bone/#attachment_1262">Figure 19.22</a>).

It takes about two months for the broken bone ends to be firmly joined together after the fracture. This is similar to the endochondral formation of bone, as cartilage becomes ossified; osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and bone matrix are present.</li> <li class="listitem">The bony callus is then remodelled by osteoclasts and osteoblasts, with excess material on the exterior of the bone and within the medullary cavity being removed. Compact bone is added to create bone tissue that is similar to the original, unbroken bone.

The human skeleton can be divided into long bones, short bones, flat bones, and irregular bones. Compact bone tissue is composed of osteons and forms the external layer of all bones. Spongy bone tissue is composed of trabeculae and forms the inner part of all bones. Four types of cells compose bony tissue: osteocytes, osteoclasts, osteoprogenitor cells, and osteoblasts. Ossification is the process of bone formation by osteoblasts. Intramembranous ossification is the process of bone development from fibrous membranes. Endochondral ossification is the process of bone development from hyaline cartilage. Long bones lengthen as chondrocytes divide and secrete hyaline cartilage. Osteoblasts replace cartilage with bone. Appositional growth is the increase in the diameter of bones by the addition of bone tissue at the surface of bones. Bone remodeling involves the processes of bone deposition by osteoblasts and bone resorption by osteoclasts. Bone repair occurs in four stages and can take several months.</p> <div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>The Haversian canal: <ol><li>is arranged as rods or plates</li> <li>contains the bone’s blood vessels and nerve fibers</li> <li>is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones</li> <li>synthesizes and secretes matrix</li> </ol> </li> <li>The epiphyseal plate: <ol><li>is arranged as rods or plates</li> <li>contains the bone’s blood vessels and nerve fibers</li> <li>is responsible for the lengthwise growth of long bones</li> <li>synthesizes and secretes bone matrix</li> </ol> </li> <li>The cells responsible for bone resorption are ________. <ol><li>osteoclasts</li> <li>osteoblasts</li> <li>fibroblasts</li> <li>osteocytes</li> </ol> </li> <li>Compact bone is composed of ________. <ol><li>trabeculae</li> <li>compacted collagen</li> <li>osteons</li> <li>calcium phosphate only</li> </ol> </li> <li>What are the major differences between spongy bone and compact bone?</li> <li>What are the roles of osteoblasts, osteocytes, and osteoclasts?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>A</li> <li>C</li> <li>Compact bone tissue forms the hard external layer of all bones and consists of osteons.

This space is referred to as the synovial (or joint) cavity and is filled with synovial fluid. Synovial fluid lubricates the joint, reducing friction between the bones and allowing for greater movement. The ends of the bones are covered with articular cartilage, a hyaline cartilage, and the entire joint is surrounded by an articular capsule composed of connective tissue that allows movement of the joint while resisting dislocation. Articular capsules may also possess ligaments that hold the bones together. Synovial joints are capable of the greatest movement of the three structural joint types; however, the more mobile a joint, the weaker the joint. Knees, elbows, and shoulders are examples of synovial joints.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1265" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4989" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.25.&nbsp; Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or “synovial cavity” in the joint." width="300" height="347" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03-259x300.jpg 259w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03-65x75.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03-225x260.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_03_03-350x405.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1265">Figure 19.25.&nbsp;<br />Synovial joints are the only joints that have a space or “synovial cavity” in the joint.</div></div> <div class="body"><div class="section" title="Classification of Joints on the Basis of Function"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Classification of Joints on the Basis of Function</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>The functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. A <strong>synarthrosis</strong> is a joint that is immovable. This includes sutures, gomphoses, and synchondroses. <strong>Amphiarthroses</strong> are joints that allow slight movement, including syndesmoses and symphyses. <strong>Diarthroses</strong>are joints that allow for free movement of the joint, as in synovial joints.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Movement at Synovial Joints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Movement at Synovial Joints</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>The wide range of movement allowed by synovial joints produces different types of movements. The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement.</p> <div class="section" title="Gliding Movement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Gliding Movement</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Gliding movements</strong>occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Gliding movements produce very little rotation or angular movement of the bones. The joints of the carpal and tarsal bones are examples of joints that produce gliding movements.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Angular Movement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Angular Movement</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Angular movements</strong> are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. There are several different types of angular movements, including flexion, extension, hyperextension, abduction, adduction, and circumduction. <strong>Flexion</strong>, or bending, occurs when the angle between the bones decreases. Moving the forearm upward at the elbow or moving the wrist to move the hand toward the forearm are examples of flexion.<strong>Extension</strong> is the opposite of flexion in that the angle between the bones of a joint increases. Straightening a limb after flexion is an example of extension. Extension past the regular anatomical position is referred to as <strong>hyperextension</strong>. This includes moving the neck back to look upward, or bending the wrist so that the hand moves away from the forearm.</p> <p><strong>Abduction</strong> occurs when a bone moves away from the midline of the body. Examples of abduction are moving the arms or legs laterally to lift them straight out to the side. <strong>Adduction</strong>is the movement of a bone toward the midline of the body. Movement of the limbs inward after abduction is an example of adduction.<strong>Circumduction</strong> is the movement of a limb in a circular motion, as in moving the arm in a circular motion.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Rotational Movement"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Rotational Movement</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><strong>Rotational movement</strong> is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its longitudinal axis. Rotation can be toward the midline of the body, which is referred to as <strong>medial rotation</strong>, or away from the midline of the body, which is referred to as <strong>lateral rotation</strong>. Movement of the head from side to side is an example of rotation.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Special Movements"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Special Movements</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Some movements that cannot be classified as gliding, angular, or rotational are called special movements. <strong>Inversion</strong> involves the soles of the feet moving inward, toward the midline of the body. <strong>Eversion</strong> is the opposite of inversion, movement of the sole of the foot outward, away from the midline of the body. <strong>Protraction</strong> is the anterior movement of a bone in the horizontal plane. <strong>Retraction</strong>occurs as a joint moves back into position after protraction. Protraction and retraction can be seen in the movement of the mandible as the jaw is thrust outwards and then back inwards. <strong>Elevation</strong> is the movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae. <strong>Depression</strong> is the opposite of elevation—movement downward of a bone, such as after the shoulders are shrugged and the scapulae return to their normal position from an elevated position.<strong>Dorsiflexion</strong> is a bending at the ankle such that the toes are lifted toward the knee. <strong>Plantar flexion</strong> is a bending at the ankle when the heel is lifted, such as when standing on the toes. <strong>Supination</strong> is the movement of the radius and ulna bones of the forearm so that the palm faces forward. <strong>Pronation</strong> is the opposite movement, in which the palm faces backward. <strong>Opposition</strong> is the movement of the thumb toward the fingers of the same hand, making it possible to grasp and hold objects.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Types of Synovial Joints"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Types of Synovial Joints</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Synovial joints are further classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint.

They diagnose and treat diseases such as arthritis, musculoskeletal disorders, osteoporosis, and autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis and rheumatoid arthritis.</p> <p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disorder that primarily affects the synovial joints of the hands, feet, and cervical spine. Affected joints become swollen, stiff, and painful. Although it is known that RA is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, the cause of RA remains unknown. Immune cells from the blood enter joints and the synovium causing cartilage breakdown, swelling, and inflammation of the joint lining. Breakdown of cartilage causes bones to rub against each other causing pain. RA is more common in women than men and the age of onset is usually 40–50 years of age.</p> <p>Rheumatologists can diagnose RA on the basis of symptoms such as joint inflammation and pain, X-ray and MRI imaging, and blood tests. Arthrography is a type of medical imaging of joints that uses a contrast agent, such as a dye, that is opaque to X-rays. This allows the soft tissue structures of joints—such as cartilage, tendons, and ligaments—to be visualized. An arthrogram differs from a regular X-ray by showing the surface of soft tissues lining the joint in addition to joint bones. An arthrogram allows early degenerative changes in joint cartilage to be detected before bones become affected.</p> <p>There is currently no cure for RA; however, rheumatologists have a number of treatment options available. Early stages can be treated with rest of the affected joints by using a cane or by using joint splints that minimize inflammation. When inflammation has decreased, exercise can be used to strengthen the muscles that surround the joint and to maintain joint flexibility. If joint damage is more extensive, medications can be used to relieve pain and decrease inflammation. Anti-inflammatory drugs such as aspirin, topical pain relievers, and corticosteroid injections may be used. Surgery may be required in cases in which joint damage is severe.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The structural classification of joints divides them into bony, fibrous, cartilaginous, and synovial joints. The bones of fibrous joints are held together by fibrous connective tissue; the three types of fibrous joints are sutures, syndesomes, and gomphoses. Cartilaginous joints are joints in which the bones are connected by cartilage; the two types of cartilaginous joints are synchondroses and symphyses. Synovial joints are joints that have a space between the adjoining bones. The functional classification divides joints into three categories: synarthroses, amphiarthroses, and diarthroses. The movement of synovial joints can be classified as one of four different types: gliding, angular, rotational, or special movement. Gliding movements occur as relatively flat bone surfaces move past each other. Angular movements are produced when the angle between the bones of a joint changes. Rotational movement is the movement of a bone as it rotates around its own longitudinal axis. Special movements include inversion, eversion, protraction, retraction, elevation, depression, dorsiflexion, plantar flexion, supination, pronation, and opposition. Synovial joints are also classified into six different categories on the basis of the shape and structure of the joint: planar, hinge, pivot, condyloid, saddle, and ball-and-socket.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Synchondroses and symphyses are: <ol><li>synovial joints</li> <li>cartilaginous joints</li> <li>fibrous joints</li> <li>condyloid joints</li> </ol> </li> <li>The movement of bone away from the midline of the body is called ________. <ol><li>circumduction</li> <li>extension</li> <li>adduction</li> <li>abductino</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following is not a characteristic of the synovial fluid? <ol><li>lubrication</li> <li>shock absorption</li> <li>regulation of water balance in the joint</li> <li>protection of articular cartilage</li> </ol> </li> <li>The elbow is an example of which type of joint? <ol><li>hinge</li> <li>pivot</li> <li>saddle</li> <li>gliding</li> </ol> </li> <li>What movements occur at the hip joint and knees as you bend down to touch your toes?</li> <li>What movement(s) occur(s) at the scapulae when you shrug your shoulders?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>C</li> <li>A</li> <li>The hip joint is flexed and the knees are extended.</li> <li>Elevation is the movement of a bone upward, such as when the shoulders are shrugged, lifting the scapulae.

Thin filaments do not extend all the way into the A bands, leaving a central region of the A band that only contains thick filaments. This central region of the A band looks slightly lighter than the rest of the A band and is called the H zone. The middle of the H zone has a vertical line called the M line, at which accessory proteins hold together thick filaments. Both the Z disc and the M line hold myofilaments in place to maintain the structural arrangement and layering of the myofibril. Myofibrils are connected to each other by intermediate, or desmin, filaments that attach to the Z disc.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm138606144"></span>Thick and thin filaments are themselves composed of proteins. Thick filaments are composed of the protein myosin. The tail of a myosin molecule connects with other myosin molecules to form the central region of a thick filament near the M line, whereas the heads align on either side of the thick filament where the thin filaments overlap. The primary component of thin filaments is the actin protein. Two other components of the thin filament are tropomyosin and troponin. Actin has binding sites for myosin attachment. Strands of tropomyosin block the binding sites and prevent actin–myosin interactions when the muscles are at rest. Troponin consists of three globular subunits. One subunit binds to tropomyosin, one subunit binds to actin, and one subunit binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p> <div id="m44788-fs-idm41804992" class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><span id="m44788-fs-idm110302880"></span><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/skeletal_muscle.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm140078832"></span>View this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscle" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/skeletal_muscle">animation</a> showing the organization of muscle fibers.</p> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Sliding Filament Model of Contraction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Sliding Filament Model of Contraction</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>For a muscle cell to contract, the sarcomere must shorten. However, thick and thin filaments—the components of sarcomeres—do not shorten. Instead, they slide by one another, causing the sarcomere to shorten while the filaments remain the same length. The sliding filament theory of muscle contraction was developed to fit the differences observed in the named bands on the sarcomere at different degrees of muscle contraction and relaxation. The mechanism of contraction is the binding of myosin to actin, forming cross-bridges that generate filament movement (Figure 19.36).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1278" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4679" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_04-1024x919-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;38.36.&nbsp; When (a) a sarcomere (b) contracts, the Z lines move closer together and the I band gets smaller.

The H zone—the central region of the A zone—contains only thick filaments and is shortened during contraction. The I band contains only thin filaments and also shortens. The A band does not shorten—it remains the same length—but A bands of different sarcomeres move closer together during contraction, eventually disappearing. Thin filaments are pulled by the thick filaments toward the center of the sarcomere until the Z discs approach the thick filaments.

This action requires energy, which is provided by ATP. Myosin binds to actin at a binding site on the globular actin protein. Myosin has another binding site for ATP at which enzymatic activity hydrolyzes ATP to ADP, releasing an inorganic phosphate molecule and energy.</p> <p>ATP binding causes myosin to release actin, allowing actin and myosin to detach from each other. After this happens, the newly bound ATP is converted to ADP and inorganic phosphate, P<sub>i</sub>. The enzyme at the binding site on myosin is called ATPase. The energy released during ATP hydrolysis changes the angle of the myosin head into a “cocked” position. The myosin head is then in a position for further movement, possessing potential energy, but ADP and P<sub>i</sub> are still attached. If actin binding sites are covered and unavailable, the myosin will remain in the high energy configuration with ATP hydrolyzed, but still attached.</p> <p>If the actin binding sites are uncovered, a cross-bridge will form; that is, the myosin head spans the distance between the actin and myosin molecules. P<sub>i</sub> is then released, allowing myosin to expend the stored energy as a conformational change. The myosin head moves toward the M line, pulling the actin along with it. As the actin is pulled, the filaments move approximately 10 nm toward the M line. This movement is called the power stroke, as it is the step at which force is produced. As the actin is pulled toward the M line, the sarcomere shortens and the muscle contracts.</p> <p>When the myosin head is “cocked,” it contains energy and is in a high-energy configuration. This energy is expended as the myosin head moves through the power stroke; at the end of the power stroke, the myosin head is in a low-energy position. After the power stroke, ADP is released; however, the cross-bridge formed is still in place, and actin and myosin are bound together. ATP can then attach to myosin, which allows the cross-bridge cycle to start again and further muscle contraction can occur (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.37.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1280" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/19-4-muscle-contraction-and-locomotion/#attachment_1280">Figure 19.37</a>).</p> <div class="note interactive"><h2 class="title"><span class="cnx-gentext-tip-t">Concept in Action<br /> </span></h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/contract_muscle.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p>Watch this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/contract_muscle">video</a> explaining how a muscle contraction is signaled.</p> </div> </div> <div class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.37.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1280" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_05.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_05.png"><img class="wp-image-4681" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05.png" alt="Figure_38_04_05" width="350" height="516" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05.png 545w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-203x300.png 203w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-65x96.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-225x332.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_05-350x516.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 19.37.&nbsp; The cross-bridge muscle contraction cycle, which is triggered by Ca2+ binding to the actin active site, is shown.

The trigger for calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the sarcoplasm is a neural signal. Each skeletal muscle fiber is controlled by a motor neuron, which conducts signals from the brain or spinal cord to the muscle. The area of the sarcolemma on the muscle fiber that interacts with the neuron is called the <span id="m44788-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1253809"></span><strong>motor end plate</strong><a id="id809604" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. The end of the neuron’s axon is called the synaptic terminal, and it does not actually contact the motor end plate. A small space called the synaptic cleft separates the synaptic terminal from the motor end plate. Electrical signals travel along the neuron’s axon, which branches through the muscle and connects to individual muscle fibers at a neuromuscular junction.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm72592000"></span>The ability of cells to communicate electrically requires that the cells expend energy to create an electrical gradient across their cell membranes. This charge gradient is carried by ions, which are differentially distributed across the membrane. Each ion exerts an electrical influence and a concentration influence. Just as milk will eventually mix with coffee without the need to stir, ions also distribute themselves evenly, if they are permitted to do so. In this case, they are not permitted to return to an evenly mixed state.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm105942816"></span>The sodium–potassium ATPase uses cellular energy to move K<sup>+</sup> ions inside the cell and Na<sup>+</sup> ions outside. This alone accumulates a small electrical charge, but a big concentration gradient. There is lots of K<sup>+</sup> in the cell and lots of Na<sup>+</sup> outside the cell. Potassium is able to leave the cell through K<sup>+</sup> channels that are open 90% of the time, and it does. However, Na<sup>+</sup> channels are rarely open, so Na<sup>+</sup> remains outside the cell. When K<sup>+</sup> leaves the cell, obeying its concentration gradient, that effectively leaves a negative charge behind. So at rest, there is a large concentration gradient for Na<sup>+</sup> to enter the cell, and there is an accumulation of negative charges left behind in the cell. This is the resting membrane potential. Potential in this context means a separation of electrical charge that is capable of doing work. It is measured in volts, just like a battery. However, the transmembrane potential is considerably smaller (0.07 V); therefore, the small value is expressed as millivolts (mV) or 70 mV. Because the inside of a cell is negative compared with the outside, a minus sign signifies the excess of negative charges inside the cell, −70 mV.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idp61065856"></span>If an event changes the permeability of the membrane to Na<sup>+</sup> ions, they will enter the cell. That will change the voltage. This is an electrical event, called an action potential, that can be used as a cellular signal. Communication occurs between nerves and muscles through neurotransmitters. Neuron action potentials cause the release of neurotransmitters from the synaptic terminal into the synaptic cleft, where they can then diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to a receptor molecule on the motor end plate. The motor end plate possesses junctional folds—folds in the sarcolemma that create a large surface area for the neurotransmitter to bind to receptors. The receptors are actually sodium channels that open to allow the passage of Na<sup>+</sup> into the cell when they receive neurotransmitter signal.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm8239040"></span>Acetylcholine (ACh) is a neurotransmitter released by motor neurons that binds to receptors in the motor end plate. Neurotransmitter release occurs when an action potential travels down the motor neuron’s axon, resulting in altered permeability of the synaptic terminal membrane and an influx of calcium. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions allow synaptic vesicles to move to and bind with the presynaptic membrane (on the neuron), and release neurotransmitter from the vesicles into the synaptic cleft. Once released by the synaptic terminal, ACh diffuses across the synaptic cleft to the motor end plate, where it binds with ACh receptors. As a neurotransmitter binds, these ion channels open, and Na<sup>+</sup> ions cross the membrane into the muscle cell. This reduces the voltage difference between the inside and outside of the cell, which is called depolarization. As ACh binds at the motor end plate, this depolarization is called an end-plate potential. The depolarization then spreads along the sarcolemma, creating an action potential as sodium channels adjacent to the initial depolarization site sense the change in voltage and open. The action potential moves across the entire cell, creating a wave of depolarization.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm177862864"></span>ACh is broken down by the enzyme <strong><span id="m44788-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1253919"></span>acetylcholinesterase</strong> (AChE) into acetyl and choline. AChE resides in the synaptic cleft, breaking down ACh so that it does not remain bound to ACh receptors, which would cause unwanted extended muscle contraction (Figure 19.38).</p> <div id="m44788-fs-idm21804560" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44788-fig-ch38_04_06" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;38.38.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1282" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_06f.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_38_04_06f.png"><img class="wp-image-5005" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f.png" alt="Figure_38_04_06f" width="350" height="383" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f.png 793w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f-274x300.png 274w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f-768x840.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f-65x71.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f-225x246.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_38_04_06f-350x383.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1282">Figure 19.38.&nbsp; This diagram shows excitation-contraction coupling in a skeletal muscle contraction.

This is called repolarization, during which voltage-gated sodium channels close. Potassium channels continue at 90% conductance. Because the plasma membrane sodium–potassium ATPase always transports ions, the resting state (negatively charged inside relative to the outside) is restored. The period immediately following the transmission of an impulse in a nerve or muscle, in which a neuron or muscle cell regains its ability to transmit another impulse, is called the refractory period. During the refractory period, the membrane cannot generate another action potential. . The refractory period allows the voltage-sensitive ion channels to return to their resting configurations. The sodium potassium ATPase continually moves Na<sup>+</sup> back out of the cell and K<sup>+</sup> back into the cell, and the K<sup>+</sup> leaks out leaving negative charge behind. Very quickly, the membrane repolarizes, so that it can again be depolarized.</p> <div class="section" title="Control of Muscle Tension"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44788-fs-idm104729504"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Control of Muscle Tension</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idp49742144"></span>Neural control initiates the formation of actin–myosin cross-bridges, leading to the sarcomere shortening involved in muscle contraction. These contractions extend from the muscle fiber through connective tissue to pull on bones, causing skeletal movement. The pull exerted by a muscle is called tension, and the amount of force created by this tension can vary. This enables the same muscles to move very light objects and very heavy objects. In individual muscle fibers, the amount of tension produced depends on the cross-sectional area of the muscle fiber and the frequency of neural stimulation.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm160082032"></span>The number of cross-bridges formed between actin and myosin determine the amount of tension that a muscle fiber can produce. Cross-bridges can only form where thick and thin filaments overlap, allowing myosin to bind to actin. If more cross-bridges are formed, more myosin will pull on actin, and more tension will be produced.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idm61158752"></span>The ideal length of a sarcomere during production of maximal tension occurs when thick and thin filaments overlap to the greatest degree. If a sarcomere at rest is stretched past an ideal resting length, thick and thin filaments do not overlap to the greatest degree, and fewer cross-bridges can form. This results in fewer myosin heads pulling on actin, and less tension is produced. As a sarcomere is shortened, the zone of overlap is reduced as the thin filaments reach the H zone, which is composed of myosin tails. Because it is myosin heads that form cross-bridges, actin will not bind to myosin in this zone, reducing the tension produced by this myofiber. If the sarcomere is shortened even more, thin filaments begin to overlap with each other—reducing cross-bridge formation even further, and producing even less tension. Conversely, if the sarcomere is stretched to the point at which thick and thin filaments do not overlap at all, no cross-bridges are formed and no tension is produced. This amount of stretching does not usually occur because accessory proteins, internal sensory nerves, and connective tissue oppose extreme stretching.</p> <p><span id="m44788-fs-idp53806432"></span>The primary variable determining force production is the number of myofibers within the muscle that receive an action potential from the neuron that controls that fiber. When using the biceps to pick up a pencil, the motor cortex of the brain only signals a few neurons of the biceps, and only a few myofibers respond. In vertebrates, each myofiber responds fully if stimulated. When picking up a piano, the motor cortex signals all of the neurons in the biceps and every myofiber participates. This is close to the maximum force the muscle can produce. As mentioned above, increasing the frequency of action potentials (the number of signals per second) can increase the force a bit more, because the tropomyosin is flooded with calcium.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <div class="section empty"><div class="section"><div class="body"><p>The body contains three types of muscle tissue: skeletal muscle, cardiac muscle, and smooth muscle. Skeleton muscle tissue is composed of sarcomeres, the functional units of muscle tissue. Muscle contraction occurs when sarcomeres shorten, as thick and thin filaments slide past each other, which is called the sliding filament model of muscle contraction. ATP provides the energy for cross-bridge formation and filament sliding. Regulatory proteins, such as troponin and tropomyosin, control cross-bridge formation. Excitation–contraction coupling transduces the electrical signal of the neuron, via acetylcholine, to an electrical signal on the muscle membrane, which initiates force production. The number of muscle fibers contracting determines how much force the whole muscle produces.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about muscle contraction is true? <ol><li>The power stroke occurs when ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and phosphate.</li> <li>The power stroke occurs when ADP and phosphate dissociate from the myosin head.</li> <li>The power stroke occurs when ADP and phosphate dissociate from the actin active site.</li> <li>The power stroke occurs when Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds the calcium head.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The deadly nerve gas Sarin irreversibly inhibits acetycholinesterase.

With every inhalation, air fills the lungs, and with every exhalation, air rushes back out. That air is doing more than just inflating and deflating the lungs in the chest cavity. The air contains oxygen that crosses the lung tissue, enters the bloodstream, and travels to organs and tissues. Oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) enters the cells where it is used for metabolic reactions that produce ATP, a high-energy compound. At the same time, these reactions release carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a by-product. CO<sub>2 </sub>is toxic and must be eliminated. Carbon dioxide exits the cells, enters the bloodstream, travels back to the lungs, and is expired out of the body during exhalation.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

The main structures of the human respiratory system are the nasal cavity, the trachea, and lungs.</p> <p>All aerobic organisms require oxygen to carry out their metabolic functions. Along the evolutionary tree, different organisms have devised different means of obtaining oxygen from the surrounding atmosphere. The environment in which the animal lives greatly determines how an animal respires. The complexity of the respiratory system is correlated with the size of the organism. As animal size increases, diffusion distances increase and the ratio of surface area to volume drops. In unicellular organisms, diffusion across the cell membrane is sufficient for supplying oxygen to the cell (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1285" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1285">Figure 20.2</a>). Diffusion is a slow, passive transport process. In order for diffusion to be a feasible means of providing oxygen to the cell, the rate of oxygen uptake must match the rate of diffusion across the membrane. In other words, if the cell were very large or thick, diffusion would not be able to provide oxygen quickly enough to the inside of the cell. Therefore, dependence on diffusion as a means of obtaining oxygen and removing carbon dioxide remains feasible only for small organisms or those with highly-flattened bodies, such as many flatworms (Platyhelminthes). Larger organisms had to evolve specialized respiratory tissues, such as gills, lungs, and respiratory passages accompanied by a complex circulatory systems, to transport oxygen throughout their entire body.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1285" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4652" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg" alt="Figure_39_01_01" width="300" height="254" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-300x254.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-65x55.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-225x191.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_01-350x297.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 20.2.&nbsp; The cell of the unicellular algae Ventricaria ventricosa is one of the largest known, reaching one to five centimeters in diameter.

Gas exchange by direct diffusion across surface membranes is efficient for organisms less than 1 mm in diameter. In simple organisms, such as cnidarians and flatworms, every cell in the body is close to the external environment. Their cells are kept moist and gases diffuse quickly via direct diffusion. Flatworms are small, literally flat worms, which ‘breathe’ through diffusion across the outer membrane (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1286" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1286">Figure 20.3</a>).

A dense network of capillaries lies just below the skin and facilitates gas exchange between the external environment and the circulatory system. The respiratory surface must be kept moist in order for the gases to dissolve and diffuse across cell membranes.</p> <p>Organisms that live in water need to obtain oxygen from the water. Oxygen dissolves in water but at a lower concentration than in the atmosphere. The atmosphere has roughly 21 percent oxygen. In water, the oxygen concentration is much smaller than that. Fish and many other aquatic organisms have evolved gills to take up the dissolved oxygen from water (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1287" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1287">Figure 20.4</a>). Gills are thin tissue filaments that are highly branched and folded. When water passes over the gills, the dissolved oxygen in water rapidly diffuses across the gills into the bloodstream. The circulatory system can then carry the oxygenated blood to the other parts of the body. In animals that contain coelomic fluid instead of blood, oxygen diffuses across the gill surfaces into the coelomic fluid. Gills are found in mollusks, annelids, and crustaceans.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1287" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4654" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.4.&nbsp; This common carp, like many other aquatic organisms, has gills that allow it to obtain oxygen from water.

Diffusion is a process in which material travels from regions of high concentration to low concentration until equilibrium is reached. In this case, blood with a low concentration of oxygen molecules circulates through the gills. The concentration of oxygen molecules in water is higher than the concentration of oxygen molecules in gills. As a result, oxygen molecules diffuse from water (high concentration) to blood (low concentration), as shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.5.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1288" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1288">Figure 20.5</a>.

The tubes in the tracheal system are made of a polymeric material called chitin.</p> <p>Insect bodies have openings, called spiracles, along the thorax and abdomen.

As air passes through the nasal cavity, the air is warmed to body temperature and humidified. The respiratory tract is coated with mucus to seal the tissues from direct contact with air. Mucus is high in water. As air crosses these surfaces of the mucous membranes, it picks up water. These processes help equilibrate the air to the body conditions, reducing any damage that cold, dry air can cause. Particulate matter that is floating in the air is removed in the nasal passages via mucus and cilia. The processes of warming, humidifying, and removing particles are important protective mechanisms that prevent damage to the trachea and lungs. Thus, inhalation serves several purposes in addition to bringing oxygen into the respiratory system.</p> <div class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="title"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1290" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_06.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_06.png"><img class="wp-image-4657" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06.png" alt="Figure_39_01_06" width="300" height="418" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06.png 469w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06-215x300.png 215w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06-65x91.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06-225x313.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_06-350x487.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 20.7.&nbsp; Air enters the respiratory system through the nasal cavity and pharynx, and then passes through the trachea and into the bronchi, which bring air into the lungs.

The main function of the trachea is to funnel the inhaled air to the lungs and the exhaled air back out of the body. The human trachea is a cylinder about 10 to 12 cm long and 2 cm in diameter that sits in front of the esophagus and extends from the larynx into the chest cavity where it divides into the two primary bronchi at the midthorax. It is made of incomplete rings of hyaline cartilage and smooth muscle (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1291" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1291">Figure 20.8</a>). The trachea is lined with mucus-producing goblet cells and ciliated epithelia. The cilia propel foreign particles trapped in the mucus toward the pharynx. The cartilage provides strength and support to the trachea to keep the passage open. The smooth muscle can contract, decreasing the trachea’s diameter, which causes expired air to rush upwards from the lungs at a great force. The forced exhalation helps expel mucus when we cough. Smooth muscle can contract or relax, depending on stimuli from the external environment or the body’s nervous system.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1291" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4658" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_07.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.8.&nbsp; The trachea and bronchi are made of incomplete rings of cartilage.

Air enters the lungs through the two <strong>primary (main) bronchi</strong> (singular: bronchus). Each bronchus divides into secondary bronchi, then into tertiary bronchi, which in turn divide, creating smaller and smaller diameter <strong>bronchioles</strong> as they split and spread through the lung. Like the trachea, the bronchi are made of cartilage and smooth muscle. At the bronchioles, the cartilage is replaced with elastic fibers. Bronchi are innervated by nerves of both the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems that control muscle contraction (parasympathetic) or relaxation (sympathetic) in the bronchi and bronchioles, depending on the nervous system’s cues. In humans, bronchioles with a diameter smaller than 0.5 mm are the <strong>respiratory bronchioles</strong>. They lack cartilage and therefore rely on inhaled air to support their shape. As the passageways decrease in diameter, the relative amount of smooth muscle increases.</p> <p>The <strong>terminal bronchioles </strong>subdivide into microscopic branches called respiratory bronchioles. The respiratory bronchioles subdivide into several alveolar ducts. Numerous alveoli and alveolar sacs surround the alveolar ducts. The alveolar sacs resemble bunches of grapes tethered to the end of the bronchioles (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.10.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1293" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1293">Figure 20.10</a>).

At the end of each duct are approximately 100 <strong>alveolar sacs,</strong> each containing 20 to 30 <strong>alveoli </strong>that are 200 to 300 microns in diameter. Gas exchange occurs only in alveoli. Alveoli are made of thin-walled parenchymal cells, typically one-cell thick, that look like tiny bubbles within the sacs. Alveoli are in direct contact with capillaries (one-cell thick) of the circulatory system. Such intimate contact ensures that oxygen will diffuse from alveoli into the blood and be distributed to the cells of the body. In addition, the carbon dioxide that was produced by cells as a waste product will diffuse from the blood into alveoli to be exhaled. The anatomical arrangement of capillaries and alveoli emphasizes the structural and functional relationship of the respiratory and circulatory systems. Because there are so many alveoli (~300 million per lung) within each alveolar sac and so many sacs at the end of each alveolar duct, the lungs have a sponge-like consistency. This organization produces a very large surface area that is available for gas exchange. The surface area of alveoli in the lungs is approximately 75 m<sup>2</sup>. This large surface area, combined with the thin-walled nature of the alveolar parenchymal cells, allows gases to easily diffuse across the cells.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1293" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_09.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_01_09.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4660" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_01_09-1024x682-1.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.10.&nbsp; Terminal bronchioles are connected by respiratory bronchioles to alveolar ducts and alveolar sacs.

The lungs produce <strong>mucus</strong>—a sticky substance made of <strong>mucin</strong>, a complex glycoprotein, as well as salts and water—that traps particulates. The bronchi and bronchioles contain cilia, small hair-like projections that line the walls of the bronchi and bronchioles (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.11.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1295" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-1-systems-of-gas-exchange/#attachment_1295">Figure 20.11</a>).

In addition, smoking causes the lungs to produce more mucus, which the damaged cilia are not able to move.

In mammals, air is warmed and humidified in the nasal cavity. Air then travels down the pharynx, through the trachea, and into the lungs. In the lungs, air passes through the branching bronchi, reaching the respiratory bronchioles, which house the first site of gas exchange. The respiratory bronchioles open into the alveolar ducts, alveolar sacs, and alveoli. Because there are so many alveoli and alveolar sacs in the lung, the surface area for gas exchange is very large. Several protective mechanisms are in place to prevent damage or infection. These include the hair and mucus in the nasal cavity that trap dust, dirt, and other particulate matter before they can enter the system. In the lungs, particles are trapped in a mucus layer and transported via cilia up to the esophageal opening at the top of the trachea to be swallowed.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about the mammalian respiratory system is false? <ol><li>When we breathe in, air travels from the pharynx to the trachea.</li> <li>The bronchioles branch into bronchi.</li> <li>Alveolar ducts connect to alveolar sacs.</li> <li>Gas exchange between the lung and blood takes place in the alveolus.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The respiratory system ________. <ol><li>provides body tissues with oxygen</li> <li>provides body tissues with oxygen and carbon dioxide</li> <li>establishes how many breaths are taken per minute</li> <li>provides the body with carbon dioxide</li> </ol> </li> <li>Air is warmed and humidified in the nasal passages.

Diffusion is a process in which transport is driven by a concentration gradient. Gas molecules move from a region of high concentration to a region of low concentration. Blood that is low in oxygen concentration and high in carbon dioxide concentration undergoes gas exchange with air in the lungs. The air in the lungs has a higher concentration of oxygen than that of oxygen-depleted blood and a lower concentration of carbon dioxide. This concentration gradient allows for gas exchange during respiration.</p> <p><span id="m44795-fs-idp83033872"></span> <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1513502"></span><strong>Partial pressure<a id="id815063" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> </strong>is a measure of the concentration of the individual components in a mixture of gases. The total pressure exerted by the mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the components in the mixture. The rate of diffusion of a gas is proportional to its partial pressure within the total gas mixture.

Cheetahs have evolved a much higher lung capacity than humans; it helps provide oxygen to all the muscles in the body and allows them to run very fast. Elephants also have a high lung capacity.

On average, this volume is around one-half liter, which is a little less than the capacity of a 20-ounce drink bottle. The <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1555849"></span><strong>expiratory reserve volume (ERV)<a id="id815455" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a></strong> is the additional amount of air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. It is the reserve amount that can be exhaled beyond what is normal. Conversely, the <strong><span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1555854"></span>inspiratory reserve volume (IRV)</strong><a id="id815470" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the additional amount of air that can be inhaled after a normal inhalation. The <strong><span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1555857"></span>residual volume (RV)</strong><a id="id815485" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the amount of air that is left after expiratory reserve volume is exhaled. The lungs are never completely empty: There is always some air left in the lungs after a maximal exhalation. If this residual volume did not exist and the lungs emptied completely, the lung tissues would stick together and the energy necessary to re-inflate the lung could be too great to overcome. Therefore, there is always some air remaining in the lungs. Residual volume is also important for preventing large fluctuations in respiratory gases (O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>). The residual volume is the only lung volume that cannot be measured directly because it is impossible to completely empty the lung of air. This volume can only be calculated rather than measured.</p> <p><span id="m44795-fs-idm55585824"></span>Capacities are measurements of two or more volumes. The <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657112"></span><strong>vital capacity (VC)</strong><a id="id815519" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> measures the maximum amount of air that can be inhaled or exhaled during a respiratory cycle. It is the sum of the expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume. The <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657118"></span><strong>inspiratory capacity (IC)</strong><a id="id815534" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the amount of air that can be inhaled after the end of a normal expiration. It is, therefore, the sum of the tidal volume and inspiratory reserve volume. The <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657122"></span><strong>functional residual capacity (FRC)</strong><a id="id815549" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> includes the expiratory reserve volume and the residual volume. The FRC measures the amount of additional air that can be exhaled after a normal exhalation. Lastly, the <strong><span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657127"></span>total lung capacity (TLC)</strong><a id="id815564" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is a measurement of the total amount of air that the lung can hold. It is the sum of the residual volume, expiratory reserve volume, tidal volume, and inspiratory reserve volume.</p> <p><span id="m44795-fs-idm4780688"></span>Lung volumes are measured by a technique called <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657138"></span><strong>spirometry</strong><a id="id815587" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. An important measurement taken during spirometry is the <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657141"></span><strong>forced expiratory volume (FEV)</strong><a id="id815601" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which measures how much air can be forced out of the lung over a specific period, usually one second (FEV1). In addition, the forced vital capacity (FVC), which is the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled, is measured. The ratio of these values ( <span id="m44795-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1657147"></span><strong>FEV1/FVC ratio</strong><a id="id815617" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>) is used to diagnose lung diseases including asthma, emphysema, and fibrosis. If the FEV1/FVC ratio is high, the lungs are not compliant (meaning they are stiff and unable to bend properly), and the patient most likely has lung fibrosis. Patients exhale most of the lung volume very quickly. Conversely, when the FEV1/FVC ratio is low, there is resistance in the lung that is characteristic of asthma. In this instance, it is hard for the patient to get the air out of his or her lungs, and it takes a long time to reach the maximal exhalation volume. In either case, breathing is difficult and complications arise.</p> <div id="m44795-fs-idp122751440" class="note career"><div class="title"><div class="body"><h2 class="title">Respiratory Therapist</h2> <p>Respiratory therapists or respiratory practitioners evaluate and treat patients with lung and cardiovascular diseases. They work as part of a medical team to develop treatment plans for patients. Respiratory therapists may treat premature babies with underdeveloped lungs, patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, or older patients suffering from lung disease such as emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). They may operate advanced equipment such as compressed gas delivery systems, ventilators, blood gas analyzers, and resuscitators. Specialized programs to become a respiratory therapist generally lead to a bachelor’s degree with a respiratory therapist specialty.

Oxygen (about 98 percent) binds reversibly to the respiratory pigment hemoglobin found in red blood cells (RBCs). RBCs carry oxygen to the tissues where oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and diffuses into the cells of the tissues. More specifically, alveolar&nbsp;P<sub>O<sub>2&nbsp;</sub></sub>is higher in the alveoli (P<sub>ALVO2</sub> = 100 mm Hg)&nbsp;than blood&nbsp;P<sub>O<sub>2</sub></sub> (40 mm Hg) in the capillaries. Because this pressure gradient exists, oxygen diffuses down its pressure gradient, moving out of the alveoli and entering the blood of the capillaries where O<sub>2</sub> binds to hemoglobin. At the same time, alveolar&nbsp;P<sub>CO2&nbsp;</sub>is lower&nbsp;P<sub>ALVO2</sub> = 40 mm Hg&nbsp;than blood&nbsp;P<sub>CO2</sub> = (45 mm Hg).

The bottom of the lungs is contained by the diaphragm, a skeletal muscle that facilitates breathing. Breathing requires the coordination of the lungs, the chest wall, and most importantly, the diaphragm.</p> <div class="section" title="Types of Breathing"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Types of Breathing</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Amphibians have evolved multiple ways of breathing. Young amphibians, like tadpoles, use gills to breathe, and they don’t leave the water. Some amphibians retain gills for life. As the tadpole grows, the gills disappear and lungs grow. These lungs are primitive and not as evolved as mammalian lungs. Adult amphibians are lacking or have a reduced diaphragm, so breathing via lungs is forced. The other means of breathing for amphibians is diffusion across the skin. To aid this diffusion, amphibian skin must remain moist.</p> <p>Birds face a unique challenge with respect to breathing: They fly. Flying consumes a great amount of energy; therefore, birds require a lot of oxygen to aid their metabolic processes. Birds have evolved a respiratory system that supplies them with the oxygen needed to enable flying. Similar to mammals, birds have lungs, which are organs specialized for gas exchange. Oxygenated air, taken in during inhalation, diffuses across the surface of the lungs into the bloodstream, and carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the lungs and expelled during exhalation. The details of breathing between birds and mammals differ substantially.</p> <p>In addition to lungs, birds have air sacs inside their body. Air flows in one direction from the posterior air sacs to the lungs and out of the anterior air sacs. The flow of air is in the opposite direction from blood flow, and gas exchange takes place much more efficiently. This type of breathing enables birds to obtain the requisite oxygen, even at higher altitudes where the oxygen concentration is low. This directionality of airflow requires two cycles of air intake and exhalation to completely get the air out of the lungs.</p> <h2>Avian Respiration</h2> <p>Birds have evolved a respiratory system that enables them to fly. Flying is a high-energy process and requires a lot of oxygen. Furthermore, many birds fly in high altitudes where the concentration of oxygen in low. How did birds evolve a respiratory system that is so unique?</p> <p>Decades of research by paleontologists have shown that birds evolved from therapods, meat-eating dinosaurs (Figure 20.14).

Lung capacity has evolved to support the animal’s activities. During inhalation, the lungs expand with air, and oxygen diffuses across the lung’s surface and enters the bloodstream.

During inhalation, volume increases as a result of contraction of the diaphragm, and pressure decreases (according to Boyle’s Law). This decrease of pressure in the thoracic cavity relative to the environment makes the cavity less than the atmosphere (Figure 20.16). Because of this drop in pressure, air rushes into the respiratory passages. To increase the volume of the lungs, the chest wall expands. This results from the contraction of the <strong>intercostal muscles</strong>, the muscles that are connected to the rib cage. Lung volume expands because the diaphragm contracts and the intercostals muscles contract, thus expanding the thoracic cavity. This increase in the volume of the thoracic cavity lowers pressure compared to the atmosphere, so air rushes into the lungs, thus increasing its volume. The resulting increase in volume is largely attributed to an increase in alveolar space, because the bronchioles and bronchi are stiff structures that do not change in size.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1303" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1303" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_03_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_03_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5022" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1.jpg" alt="Figure_39_03_03" width="500" height="209" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1-300x125.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1-768x321.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1-65x27.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1-225x94.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_03-1024x428-1-350x146.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1303">Figure 20.16.&nbsp; The lungs, chest wall, and diaphragm are all involved in respiration, both (a) inhalation and (b) expiration.

The lungs are elastic; therefore, when air fills the lungs, the <strong>elastic recoil</strong> within the tissues of the lung exerts pressure back toward the interior of the lungs. These outward and inward forces compete to inflate and deflate the lung with every breath. Upon exhalation, the lungs recoil to force the air out of the lungs, and the intercostal muscles relax, returning the chest wall back to its original position (Figure 20.16 b). The diaphragm also relaxes and moves higher into the thoracic cavity. This increases the pressure within the thoracic cavity relative to the environment, and air rushes out of the lungs. The movement of air out of the lungs is a passive event. No muscles are contracting to expel the air.</p> <p>Each lung is surrounded by an invaginated sac.

On average, under non-exertion conditions, the human respiratory rate is 12–15 breaths/minute. The respiratory rate contributes to the <strong>alveolar ventilation</strong>, or how much air moves into and out of the alveoli. Alveolar ventilation prevents carbon dioxide buildup in the alveoli. There are two ways to keep the alveolar ventilation constant: increase the respiratory rate while decreasing the tidal volume of air per breath (shallow breathing), or decrease the respiratory rate while increasing the tidal volume per breath. In either case, the ventilation remains the same, but the work done and type of work needed are quite different. Both tidal volume and respiratory rate are closely regulated when oxygen demand increases.</p> <p>There are two types of work conducted during respiration, flow-resistive and elastic work. <strong>Flow-resistive</strong> refers to the work of the alveoli and tissues in the lung, whereas <strong>elastic work</strong> refers to the work of the intercostal muscles, chest wall, and diaphragm. Increasing the respiration rate increases the flow-resistive work of the airways and decreases the elastic work of the muscles. Decreasing the respiratory rate reverses the type of work required.</p> <div class="section" title="Surfactant"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Surfactant</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>The air-tissue/water interface of the alveoli has a high surface tension. This surface tension is similar to the surface tension of water at the liquid-air interface of a water droplet that results in the bonding of the water molecules together. <strong>Surfactant</strong> is a complex mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins that works to reduce the surface tension that exists between the alveoli tissue and the air found within the alveoli. By lowering the surface tension of the alveolar fluid, it reduces the tendency of alveoli to collapse.</p> <p>Surfactant works like a detergent to reduce the surface tension and allows for easier inflation of the airways. When a balloon is first inflated, it takes a large amount of effort to stretch the plastic and start to inflate the balloon. If a little bit of detergent was applied to the interior of the balloon, then the amount of effort or work needed to begin to inflate the balloon would decrease, and it would become much easier to start blowing up the balloon. This same principle applies to the airways. A small amount of surfactant to the airway tissues reduces the effort or work needed to inflate those airways. Babies born prematurely sometimes do not produce enough surfactant. As a result, they suffer from <strong>respiratory distress syndrome</strong>, because it requires more effort to inflate their lungs. Surfactant is also important for preventing collapse of small alveoli relative to large alveoli.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Lung Resistance and Compliance"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2>Lung Resistance and Compliance</h2> </div> </div> </div> <p>Pulmonary diseases reduce the rate of gas exchange into and out of the lungs. Two main causes of decreased gas exchange are <strong>compliance</strong> (how elastic the lung is) and <strong>resistance</strong>(how much obstruction exists in the airways). A change in either can dramatically alter breathing and the ability to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide.</p> <p>Examples of <strong>restrictive diseases</strong> are respiratory distress syndrome and pulmonary fibrosis. In both diseases, the airways are less compliant and they are stiff or fibrotic. There is a decrease in compliance because the lung tissue cannot bend and move. In these types of restrictive diseases, the intrapleural pressure is more positive and the airways collapse upon exhalation, which traps air in the lungs. Forced or <strong>functional vital capacity (FVC)</strong>, which is the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled after taking the deepest breath possible, is much lower than in normal patients, and the time it takes to exhale most of the air is greatly prolonged (Figure 20.18). A patient suffering from these diseases cannot exhale the normal amount of air.</p> <p><strong>Obstructive diseases</strong> and conditions include emphysema, asthma, and pulmonary edema. In emphysema, which mostly arises from smoking tobacco, the walls of the alveoli are destroyed, decreasing the surface area for gas exchange. The overall compliance of the lungs is increased, because as the alveolar walls are damaged, lung elastic recoil decreases due to a loss of elastic fibers, and more air is trapped in the lungs at the end of exhalation. Asthma is a disease in which inflammation is triggered by environmental factors. Inflammation obstructs the airways. The obstruction may be due to edema (fluid accumulation), smooth muscle spasms in the walls of the bronchioles, increased mucus secretion, damage to the epithelia of the airways, or a combination of these events. Those with asthma or edema experience increased occlusion from increased inflammation of the airways. This tends to block the airways, preventing the proper movement of gases (Figure 20.18). Those with obstructive diseases have large volumes of air trapped after exhalation and breathe at a very high lung volume to compensate for the lack of airway recruitment.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1306" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1306" style="width: 350px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_03_05f.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_39_03_05f.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5025" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_39_03_05f.jpg" alt="Figure&nbsp;39.18.&nbsp; The ratio of FEV1 (the amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled in one second after taking a deep breath) to FVC (the total amount of air that can be forcibly exhaled) can be used to diagnose whether a person has restrictive or obstructive lung disease.

It is also independent of cardiac output. This is because of a phenomenon called <strong>recruitment</strong>, which is the process of opening airways that normally remain closed when cardiac output increases. As cardiac output increases, the number of capillaries and arteries that are perfused (filled with blood) increases. These capillaries and arteries are not always in use but are ready if needed. At times, however, there is a mismatch between the amount of air (ventilation, V) and the amount of blood (perfusion, Q) in the lungs. This is referred to as <strong>ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) mismatch</strong>.</p> <p>There are two types of V/Q mismatch. Both produce <strong>dead space</strong>, regions of broken down or blocked lung tissue. Dead spaces can severely impact breathing, because they reduce the surface area available for gas diffusion. As a result, the amount of oxygen in the blood decreases, whereas the carbon dioxide level increases. Dead space is created when no ventilation and/or perfusion takes place. <strong>Anatomical dead space</strong> or anatomical shunt, arises from an anatomical failure, while <strong>physiological dead space</strong>or physiological shunt, arises from a functional impairment of the lung or arteries.</p> <p>An example of an anatomical shunt is the effect of gravity on the lungs. The lung is particularly susceptible to changes in the magnitude and direction of gravitational forces. When someone is standing or sitting upright, the pleural pressure gradient leads to increased ventilation further down in the lung. As a result, the intrapleural pressure is more negative at the base of the lung than at the top, and more air fills the bottom of the lung than the top. Likewise, it takes less energy to pump blood to the bottom of the lung than to the top when in a prone position. Perfusion of the lung is not uniform while standing or sitting. This is a result of hydrostatic forces combined with the effect of airway pressure. An anatomical shunt develops because the ventilation of the airways does not match the perfusion of the arteries surrounding those airways. As a result, the rate of gas exchange is reduced. Note that this does not occur when lying down, because in this position, gravity does not preferentially pull the bottom of the lung down.</p> <p>A physiological shunt can develop if there is infection or edema in the lung that obstructs an area. This will decrease ventilation but not affect perfusion; therefore, the V/Q ratio changes and gas exchange is affected.</p> <p>The lung can compensate for these mismatches in ventilation and perfusion. If ventilation is greater than perfusion, the arterioles dilate and the bronchioles constrict. This increases perfusion and reduces ventilation. Likewise, if ventilation is less than perfusion, the arterioles constrict and the bronchioles dilate to correct the imbalance.</p> <h2>Concept in Action</h2> <div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/breathing.png" alt="QR Code representing a URL" width="120" title="" /></div> <p>&gt;Visit this <a class="link" href="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/breathing" target="" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="http://openstaxcollege.org/l/breathing">site</a> to view the mechanics of breathing.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The structure of the lungs and thoracic cavity control the mechanics of breathing. Upon inspiration, the diaphragm contracts and lowers. The intercostal muscles contract and expand the chest wall outward. The intrapleural pressure drops, the lungs expand, and air is drawn into the airways. When exhaling, the intercostal muscles and diaphragm relax, returning the intrapleural pressure back to the resting state. The lungs recoil and airways close. The air passively exits the lung. There is high surface tension at the air-airway interface in the lung. Surfactant, a mixture of phospholipids and lipoproteins, acts like a detergent in the airways to reduce surface tension and allow for opening of the alveoli.</p> <p>Breathing and gas exchange are both altered by changes in the compliance and resistance of the lung. If the compliance of the lung decreases, as occurs in restrictive diseases like fibrosis, the airways stiffen and collapse upon exhalation. Air becomes trapped in the lungs, making breathing more difficult. If resistance increases, as happens with asthma or emphysema, the airways become obstructed, trapping air in the lungs and causing breathing to become difficult. Alterations in the ventilation of the airways or perfusion of the arteries can affect gas exchange. These changes in ventilation and perfusion, called V/Q mismatch, can arise from anatomical or physiological changes.</p> <div class="glossary" title="Glossary"><div class="titlepage"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>How would paralysis of the diaphragm alter inspiration? <ol><li>It would prevent contraction of the intercostal muscles.</li> <li>It would prevent inhalation because the intrapleural pressure would not change.</li> <li>It would decrease the intrapleural pressure and allow more air to enter the lungs.</li> <li>It would slow expiration because the lung would not relax.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Restrictive airway diseases ________. <ol><li>increase the compliance of the lung</li> <li>decrease the compliance of the lung</li> <li>increase the lung volume</li> <li>decrease the work of breathing</li> </ol> </li> <li>Alveolar ventilation remains constant when ________. <ol><li>the respiratory rate is increased while the volume of air per breath is decreased</li> <li>the respiratory rate and the volume of air per breath are increased</li> <li>the respiratory rate is decreased while increasing the volume per breath</li> <li>both a and c</li> </ol> </li> <li>How would increased airway resistance affect intrapleural pressure during inhalation?</li> <li>Explain how a puncture to the thoracic cavity (from a knife wound, for instance) could alter the ability to inhale.</li> <li>When someone is standing, gravity stretches the bottom of the lung down toward the floor to a greater extent than the top of the lung.

When carbon dioxide is in the blood, it reacts with water to form bicarbonate (HCO<sup>−</sup><sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;and hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>). As the level of carbon dioxide in the blood increases, more H<sup>+</sup> is produced and the pH decreases. This increase in carbon dioxide and subsequent decrease in pH reduce the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. The oxygen dissociates from the Hb molecule, shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the right. Therefore, more oxygen is needed to reach the same hemoglobin saturation level as when the pH was higher. A similar shift in the curve also results from an increase in body temperature. Increased temperature, such as from increased activity of skeletal muscle, causes the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen to be reduced.</p> <p><span id="m44799-fs-idp171429712"></span>Diseases like sickle cell anemia and thalassemia decrease the blood’s ability to deliver oxygen to tissues and its oxygen-carrying capacity.

Several properties of carbon dioxide in the blood affect its transport. First, carbon dioxide is more soluble in blood than oxygen. About 5 to 7 percent of all carbon dioxide is dissolved in the plasma. Second, carbon dioxide can bind to plasma proteins or can enter red blood cells and bind to hemoglobin. This form transports about 10 percent of the carbon dioxide. When carbon dioxide binds to hemoglobin, a molecule called <span id="m44799-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1756195"></span><strong>carbaminohemoglobin</strong><a id="id825708" class="indexterm" data-url=""></a> is formed. Binding of carbon dioxide to hemoglobin is reversible. Therefore, when it reaches the lungs, the carbon dioxide can freely dissociate from the hemoglobin and be expelled from the body.</p> <p><span id="m44799-fs-idm120497488"></span>Third, the majority of carbon dioxide molecules (85 percent) are carried as part of the <span id="m44799-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1756210"></span><strong>bicarbonate buffer system</strong><a id="id825730" class="indexterm" data-url=""></a>. In this system, carbon dioxide diffuses into the red blood cells. <span id="m44799-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1756213"></span><strong>Carbonic anhydrase (CA)</strong><a id="id825745" class="indexterm" data-url=""></a> within the red blood cells quickly converts the carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). Carbonic acid is an unstable intermediate molecule that immediately dissociates into <span id="m44799-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1756225"></span>&nbsp;(HCO<sup>−</sup><sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;<a id="id825925" class="indexterm" data-url=""></a> and hydrogen (H<sup>+</sup>) ions. Since carbon dioxide is quickly converted into bicarbonate ions, this reaction allows for the continued uptake of carbon dioxide into the blood down its concentration gradient. It also results in the production of H<sup>+</sup> ions. If too much H<sup>+</sup> is produced, it can alter blood pH. However, hemoglobin binds to the free H<sup>+</sup> ions and thus limits shifts in pH. The newly synthesized bicarbonate ion is transported out of the red blood cell into the liquid component of the blood in exchange for a chloride ion (Cl<sup>–</sup>); this is called the <b>bicarbonate (HCO−3) ion</b>. When the blood reaches the lungs, the bicarbonate ion is transported back into the red blood cell in exchange for the chloride ion. The H<sup>+</sup> ion dissociates from the hemoglobin and binds to the bicarbonate ion. This produces the carbonic acid intermediate, which is converted back into carbon dioxide through the enzymatic action of CA. The carbon dioxide produced is expelled through the lungs during exhalation.</p> <div id="m44799-eip-541" class="equation" title="Equation&nbsp;39.9.&nbsp;"><div class="mediaobject"><img class="aligncenter" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/autogen-svg2png-0005.png" alt="image" title="" /></div> </div> <p><span id="m44799-fs-idp52167680"></span>The benefit of the bicarbonate buffer system is that carbon dioxide is “soaked up” into the blood with little change to the pH of the system. This is important because it takes only a small change in the overall pH of the body for severe injury or death to result. The presence of this bicarbonate buffer system also allows for people to travel and live at high altitudes: When the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon dioxide change at high altitudes, the bicarbonate buffer system adjusts to regulate carbon dioxide while maintaining the correct pH in the body.</p> <div class="section" title="Carbon Monoxide Poisoning"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44799-fs-idp174613152"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Carbon Monoxide Poisoning</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44799-fs-idm20873728"></span>While carbon dioxide can readily associate and dissociate from hemoglobin, other molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) cannot. Carbon monoxide has a greater affinity for hemoglobin than oxygen. Therefore, when carbon monoxide is present, it binds to hemoglobin preferentially over oxygen. As a result, oxygen cannot bind to hemoglobin, so very little oxygen is transported through the body (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;39.22.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1312" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/20-4-transport-of-gases-in-human-bodily-fluids/#attachment_1312">Figure 20.22</a>). Carbon monoxide is a colorless, odorless gas and is therefore difficult to detect. It is produced by gas-powered vehicles and tools. Carbon monoxide can cause headaches, confusion, and nausea; long-term exposure can cause brain damage or death.

Oxygen readily binds this heme group. The ability of oxygen to bind increases as more oxygen molecules are bound to heme. Disease states and altered conditions in the body can affect the binding ability of oxygen, and increase or decrease its ability to dissociate from hemoglobin.</p> <p><span id="m44799-fs-idp66767536"></span>Carbon dioxide can be transported through the blood via three methods. It is dissolved directly in the blood, bound to plasma proteins or hemoglobin, or converted into bicarbonate. The majority of carbon dioxide is transported as part of the bicarbonate system. Carbon dioxide diffuses into red blood cells. Inside, carbonic anhydrase converts carbon dioxide into carbonic acid (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>), which is subsequently hydrolyzed into bicarbonate&nbsp;(HCO<sup>−</sup><sub>3</sub>)&nbsp;and H<sup>+</sup>. The H<sup>+</sup> ion binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells, and bicarbonate is transported out of the red blood cells in exchange for a chloride ion. This is called the chloride shift. Bicarbonate leaves the red blood cells and enters the blood plasma. In the lungs, bicarbonate is transported back into the red blood cells in exchange for chloride. The H<sup>+</sup> dissociates from hemoglobin and combines with bicarbonate to form carbonic acid with the help of carbonic anhydrase, which further catalyzes the reaction to convert carbonic acid back into carbon dioxide and water. The carbon dioxide is then expelled from the lungs.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>The kidneys are responsible for removing excess H+ ions from the blood.

The circulatory system has evolved over time from simple diffusion through cells in the early evolution of animals to a complex network of blood vessels that reach all parts of the human body. This extensive network supplies the cells, tissues, and organs with oxygen and nutrients, and removes carbon dioxide and waste, which are byproducts of respiration.</p> <p><span id="m44800-fs-idp87826144"></span>At the core of the human circulatory system is the heart. The size of a clenched fist, the human heart is protected beneath the rib cage. Made of specialized and unique cardiac muscle, it pumps blood throughout the body and to the heart itself. Heart contractions are driven by intrinsic electrical impulses that the brain and endocrine hormones help to regulate. Understanding the heart’s basic anatomy and function is important to understanding the body’s circulatory and respiratory systems.</p> <p><span id="m44800-fs-idm24730624"></span>Gas exchange is one essential function of the circulatory system. A circulatory system is not needed in organisms with no specialized respiratory organs because oxygen and carbon dioxide diffuse directly between their body tissues and the external environment. However, in organisms that possess lungs and gills, oxygen must be transported from these specialized respiratory organs to the body tissues via a circulatory system. Therefore, circulatory systems have had to evolve to accommodate the great diversity of body sizes and body types present among animals.</p> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

In all vertebrate organisms, as well as some invertebrates, this is a closed-loop system, in which the blood is not free in a cavity. In a <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1737268"></span><strong>closed circulatory system</strong>, blood is contained inside blood vessels and circulates <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1737271"></span><strong>unidirectionally</strong> from the heart around the systemic circulatory route, then returns to the heart again, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1315" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-1-overview-of-the-circulatory-system/#attachment_1315">Figure 21.2</a><span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>. As opposed to a closed system, arthropods—including insects, crustaceans, and most mollusks—have an open circulatory system, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.2.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1315" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-1-overview-of-the-circulatory-system/#attachment_1315">Figure 21.2</a><span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>. In an <strong><span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720106"></span>open circulatory system</strong>, the blood is not enclosed in the blood vessels but is pumped into a cavity called a <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720110"></span><strong>hemocoel</strong> and is called <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720114"></span><strong>hemolymph</strong> because the blood mixes with the <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720117"></span><strong>interstitial fluid</strong>. As the heart beats and the animal moves, the hemolymph circulates around the organs within the body cavity and then reenters the hearts through openings called <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1720122"></span><strong>ostia</strong>. This movement allows for gas and nutrient exchange. An open circulatory system does not use as much energy as a closed system to operate or to maintain; however, there is a trade-off with the amount of blood that can be moved to metabolically active organs and tissues that require high levels of oxygen. In fact, one reason that insects with wing spans of up to two feet wide (70 cm) are not around today is probably because they were outcompeted by the arrival of birds 150 million years ago. Birds, having a closed circulatory system, are thought to have moved more agilely, allowing them to get food faster and possibly to prey on the insects.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1315" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1315" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_01_01ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_01_01ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5039" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1.jpg" alt="Figure_40_01_01ab" width="600" height="221" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1-300x111.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1-768x284.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1-65x24.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1-225x83.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_40_01_01ab-1024x378-1-350x129.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1315">Figure 21.2.&nbsp; In (a) closed circulatory systems, the heart pumps blood through vessels that are separate from the interstitial fluid of the body.

Most arthropods and many mollusks have open circulatory systems. In an open system, an elongated beating heart pushes the hemolymph through the body and muscle contractions help to move fluids. The larger more complex crustaceans, including lobsters, have developed arterial-like vessels to push blood through their bodies, and the most active mollusks, such as squids, have evolved a closed circulatory system and are able to move rapidly to catch prey. Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptation during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Figure 21.4 illustrates the basic circulatory systems of some vertebrates: fish, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1317" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1317" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5041" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1.jpg" alt="Figure_40_01_03abcd" width="600" height="721" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1.jpg 852w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1-250x300.jpg 250w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1-768x923.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1-65x78.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1-225x270.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_01_03abcd-852x1024-1-350x421.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1317">Figure 21.4.&nbsp; (a) Fish have the simplest circulatory systems of the vertebrates: blood flows unidirectionally from the two-chambered heart through the gills and then the rest of the body.

The atrium collects blood that has returned from the body and the ventricle pumps the blood to the gills where gas exchange occurs and the blood is re-oxygenated; this is called <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742875"></span><strong>gill circulation</strong>. The blood then continues through the rest of the body before arriving back at the atrium; this is called <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742880"></span><strong>systemic circulation</strong>. This unidirectional flow of blood produces a gradient of oxygenated to deoxygenated blood around the fish’s systemic circuit. The result is a limit in the amount of oxygen that can reach some of the organs and tissues of the body, reducing the overall metabolic capacity of fish.</p> <p><span id="m44801-fs-idm16534736"></span>In amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals, blood flow is directed in two circuits: one through the lungs and back to the heart, which is called <strong><span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742891"></span>pulmonary circulation</strong>, and the other throughout the rest of the body and its organs including the brain (systemic circulation). In amphibians, gas exchange also occurs through the skin during pulmonary circulation and is referred to as <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742897"></span><strong>pulmocutaneous circulation</strong>.</p> <p><span id="m44801-fs-idm54470560"></span>As shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1317" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-1-overview-of-the-circulatory-system/#attachment_1317">Figure 21.4</a><span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>, amphibians have a three-chambered heart that has two atria and one ventricle rather than the two-chambered heart of fish. The two <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742920"></span><strong>atria</strong> (superior heart chambers) receive blood from the two different circuits (the lungs and the systems), and then there is some mixing of the blood in the heart’s <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1742925"></span><strong>ventricle</strong> (inferior heart chamber), which reduces the efficiency of oxygenation. The advantage to this arrangement is that high pressure in the vessels pushes blood to the lungs and body. The mixing is mitigated by a ridge within the ventricle that diverts oxygen-rich blood through the systemic circulatory system and deoxygenated blood to the pulmocutaneous circuit. For this reason, amphibians are often described as having <span id="m44801-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1741673"></span><strong>double circulation</strong>.</p> <p><span id="m44801-fs-idm31957376"></span>Most reptiles also have a three-chambered heart similar to the amphibian heart that directs blood to the pulmonary and systemic circuits, as shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1317" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-1-overview-of-the-circulatory-system/#attachment_1317">Figure 21.4</a><span class="bold"><strong>c</strong></span>. The ventricle is divided more effectively by a partial septum, which results in less mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood. Some reptiles (alligators and crocodiles) are the most primitive animals to exhibit a four-chambered heart. Crocodilians have a unique circulatory mechanism where the heart shunts blood from the lungs toward the stomach and other organs during long periods of submergence, for instance, while the animal waits for prey or stays underwater waiting for prey to rot. One adaptation includes two main arteries that leave the same part of the heart: one takes blood to the lungs and the other provides an alternate route to the stomach and other parts of the body. Two other adaptations include a hole in the heart between the two ventricles, called the foramen of Panizza, which allows blood to move from one side of the heart to the other, and specialized connective tissue that slows the blood flow to the lungs. Together these adaptations have made crocodiles and alligators one of the most evolutionarily successful animal groups on earth.</p> <p><span id="m44801-fs-idm170514160"></span>In mammals and birds, the heart is also divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.4.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1317" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-1-overview-of-the-circulatory-system/#attachment_1317">Figure 21.4</a><span class="bold"><strong>d</strong></span>. The oxygenated blood is separated from the deoxygenated blood, which improves the efficiency of double circulation and is probably required for the warm-blooded lifestyle of mammals and birds. The four-chambered heart of birds and mammals evolved independently from a three-chambered heart. The independent evolution of the same or a similar biological trait is referred to as convergent evolution.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>In most animals, the circulatory system is used to transport blood through the body. Some primitive animals use diffusion for the exchange of water, nutrients, and gases. However, complex organisms use the circulatory system to carry gases, nutrients, and waste through the body. Circulatory systems may be open (mixed with the interstitial fluid) or closed (separated from the interstitial fluid). Closed circulatory systems are a characteristic of vertebrates; however, there are significant differences in the structure of the heart and the circulation of blood between the different vertebrate groups due to adaptions during evolution and associated differences in anatomy. Fish have a two-chambered heart with unidirectional circulation. Amphibians have a three-chambered heart, which has some mixing of the blood, and they have double circulation. Most non-avian reptiles have a three-chambered heart, but have little mixing of the blood; they have double circulation. Mammals and birds have a four-chambered heart with no mixing of the blood and double circulation.</p> </div> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about the circulatory system is false? <ol><li>Blood in the pulmonary vein is deoxygenated.</li> <li>Blood in the inferior vena cava is deoxygenated.</li> <li>Blood in the pulmonary artery is deoxygenated.</li> <li>Blood in the aorta is oxygenated.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following statements about the heart is false? <ol><li>The mitral valve separates the left ventricle from the left atrium.</li> <li>Blood travels through the bicuspid valve to the left atrium.</li> <li>Both the aortic and the pulmonary valves are semilunar valves.</li> <li>The mitral valve is an atrioventricular valve.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Varicose veins are veins that become enlarged because the valves no longer close properly, allowing blood to flow backward.

Blood plasma is actually the dominant component of blood and contains the water, proteins, electrolytes, lipids, and glucose. The cells are responsible for carrying the gases (red cells) and immune the response (white). The platelets are responsible for blood clotting. Interstitial fluid that surrounds cells is separate from the blood, but in hemolymph, they are combined. In humans, cellular components make up approximately 45 percent of the blood and the liquid plasma 55 percent. Blood is 20 percent of a person’s extracellular fluid and eight percent of weight.</p> <div class="section" title="The Role of Blood in the Body"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44804-fs-idp59995264"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Role of Blood in the Body</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp41102240"></span>Blood, like the human blood illustrated in</p> </div> <p><a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.5.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1318" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-2-components-of-the-blood/#attachment_1318">Figure 21.5 </a>is important for regulation of the body’s systems and homeostasis.

In mammals, red blood cells are small biconcave cells that at maturity do not contain a nucleus or mitochondria and are only 7–8 µm in size. In birds and non-avian reptiles, a nucleus is still maintained in red blood cells.</p> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp477648"></span>The red coloring of blood comes from the iron-containing protein hemoglobin, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.6.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1319" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-2-components-of-the-blood/#attachment_1319">Figure 21.6</a><span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>. The principal job of this protein is to carry oxygen, but it also transports carbon dioxide as well. Hemoglobin is packed into red blood cells at a rate of about 250 million molecules of hemoglobin per cell. Each hemoglobin molecule binds four oxygen molecules so that each red blood cell carries one billion molecules of oxygen. There are approximately 25 trillion red blood cells in the five liters of blood in the human body, which could carry up to 25 sextillion (25 × 10<sup>21</sup>) molecules of oxygen in the body at any time. In mammals, the lack of organelles in erythrocytes leaves more room for the hemoglobin molecules, and the lack of mitochondria also prevents use of the oxygen for metabolic respiration. Only mammals have anucleated red blood cells, and some mammals (camels, for instance) even have nucleated red blood cells. The advantage of nucleated red blood cells is that these cells can undergo mitosis. Anucleated red blood cells metabolize anaerobically (without oxygen), making use of a primitive metabolic pathway to produce ATP and increase the efficiency of oxygen transport.</p> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp2890128"></span>Not all organisms use hemoglobin as the method of oxygen transport. Invertebrates that utilize hemolymph rather than blood use different pigments to bind to the oxygen. These pigments use copper or iron to the oxygen. Invertebrates have a variety of other respiratory pigments. Hemocyanin, a blue-green, copper-containing protein, illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.6.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1319" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-2-components-of-the-blood/#attachment_1319">Figure 21.6</a><span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span> is found in mollusks, crustaceans, and some of the arthropods.

Hemoglobin is composed of four protein subunits, two alpha chains and two beta chains, and a heme group that has iron associated with it. The iron reversibly associates with oxygen, and in so doing is oxidized from Fe2+ to Fe3+. In most mollusks and some arthropods, (b) hemocyanin delivers oxygen. Unlike hemoglobin, hemolymph is not carried in blood cells, but floats free in the hemolymph. Copper instead of iron binds the oxygen, giving the hemolymph a blue-green color. In annelids, such as the earthworm, and some other invertebrates, (c) hemerythrin carries oxygen.

In the lungs, carbon dioxide is released and oxygen is taken in by the blood. In the tissues, oxygen is released from the blood and carbon dioxide is bound for transport back to the lungs. Studies have found that hemoglobin also binds nitrous oxide (NO). NO is a vasodilator that relaxes the blood vessels and capillaries and may help with gas exchange and the passage of red blood cells through narrow vessels. Nitroglycerin, a heart medication for angina and heart attacks, is converted to NO to help relax the blood vessels and increase oxygen flow through the body.</p> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp67486928"></span>A characteristic of red blood cells is their glycolipid and glycoprotein coating; these are lipids and proteins that have carbohydrate molecules attached. In humans, the surface glycoproteins and glycolipids on red blood cells vary between individuals, producing the different blood types, such as A, B, and O. Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days, at which time they are broken down and recycled in the liver and spleen by phagocytic macrophages, a type of white blood cell.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="White Blood Cells"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44804-fs-idm16826080"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">White Blood Cells</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp46599552"></span>White blood cells, also called leukocytes (leuko = white), make up approximately one percent by volume of the cells in blood. The role of white blood cells is very different than that of red blood cells: they are primarily involved in the immune response to identify and target pathogens, such as invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms. White blood cells are formed continually; some only live for hours or days, but some live for years.</p> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp108417440"></span>The morphology of white blood cells differs significantly from red blood cells. They have nuclei and do not contain hemoglobin. The different types of white blood cells are identified by their microscopic appearance after histologic staining, and each has a different specialized function.

Some leukocytes become macrophages that either stay at the same site or move through the blood stream and gather at sites of infection or inflammation where they are attracted by chemical signals from foreign particles and damaged cells. Lymphocytes are the primary cells of the immune system and include B cells, T cells, and natural killer cells. B cells destroy bacteria and inactivate their toxins. They also produce antibodies. T cells attack viruses, fungi, some bacteria, transplanted cells, and cancer cells. T cells attack viruses by releasing toxins that kill the viruses.

Small cell fragments called platelets (thrombocytes) are attracted to the wound site where they adhere by extending many projections and releasing their contents. These contents activate other platelets and also interact with other coagulation factors, which convert fibrinogen, a water-soluble protein present in blood serum into fibrin (a non-water soluble protein), causing the blood to clot. Many of the clotting factors require vitamin K to work, and vitamin K deficiency can lead to problems with blood clotting. Many platelets converge and stick together at the wound site forming a platelet plug (also called a fibrin clot), as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1321" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-2-components-of-the-blood/#attachment_1321">Figure 21.8</a><span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>.

Antibodies called agglutinougens are found in the blood plasma and react with the A or B antigens, if the two are mixed. When type A and type B blood are combined, agglutination (clumping) of the blood occurs because of antibodies in the plasma that bind with the opposing antigen; this causes clots that coagulate in the kidney causing kidney failure. Type O blood has neither A or B antigens, and therefore, type O blood can be given to all blood types. Type O negative blood is the universal donor. Type AB positive blood is the universal acceptor because it has both A and B antigen. The ABO blood groups were discovered in 1900 and 1901 by Karl Landsteiner at the University of Vienna.</p> <p><span id="m44804-fs-idp22596768"></span>The Rh blood group was first discovered in Rhesus monkeys. Most people have the Rh antigen (Rh+) and do not have anti-Rh antibodies in their blood. The few people who do not have the Rh antigen and are Rh– can develop anti-Rh antibodies if exposed to Rh+ blood. This can happen after a blood transfusion or after an Rh– woman has an Rh+ baby. The first exposure does not usually cause a reaction; however, at the second exposure, enough antibodies have built up in the blood to produce a reaction that causes agglutination and breakdown of red blood cells. An injection can prevent this reaction.</p> <div id="m44804-fig-ch40_02_05" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.9.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1322" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_02_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_02_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5048" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1.jpg" alt="Figure_40_02_05" width="600" height="127" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1-300x64.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1-768x163.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1-65x14.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1-225x48.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_02_05-1024x217-1-350x74.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1322">Figure 21.9.&nbsp; Human red blood cells may have either type A or B glycoproteins on their surface, both glycoproteins combined (AB), or neither (O).

Blood is important for regulation of the body’s pH, temperature, osmotic pressure, the circulation of nutrients and removal of waste, the distribution of hormones from endocrine glands, and the elimination of excess heat; it also contains components for blood clotting. Red blood cells are specialized cells that contain hemoglobin and circulate through the body delivering oxygen to cells. White blood cells are involved in the immune response to identify and target invading bacteria, viruses, and other foreign organisms; they also recycle waste components, such as old red blood cells. Platelets and blood clotting factors cause the change of the soluble protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin at a wound site forming a plug. Plasma consists of 90 percent water along with various substances, such as coagulation factors and antibodies. The serum is the plasma component of the blood without the coagulation factors.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>White blood cells <ol><li>&nbsp;can be classified as granulocytes or agranulocytes</li> <li>defend the body against bacteria and viruses</li> <li>are also called leucocytes</li> <li>All of the above</li> </ol> </li> <li>Platelet plug formation occurs at which point? <ol><li>when large megakaryocytes break up into thousands of smaller fragments</li> <li>when platelets are dispersed through the blood stream</li> <li>when platelets are attracted to a site of blood vessel damage</li> <li>none of the above</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44804-fs-idp17965264">In humans, the plasma comprises what percentage of the blood?</span> <ol><li>45 percent</li> <li>55 percent</li> <li>25 percent</li> <li>90 percent</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44804-fs-idm121623104">The red blood cells of birds differ from mammalian red blood cells because:</span> <ol><li>they are white and have nuclei</li> <li>they do not have nuclei</li> <li>they have nuclei</li> <li>they fight disease</li> </ol> </li> <li>Describe the cause of different blood type groups.</li> <li>List some of the functions of blood in the body.</li> <li><span id="m44804-fs-idm32982016">How does the lymphatic system work with blood flow?</span></li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>D</li> <li>C</li> <li>B</li> <li>C</li> <li>Red blood cells are coated with proteins called antigens made of glycolipids and glycoproteins.

Coronary circulation intrinsic to the heart takes blood directly from the main artery (aorta) coming from the heart. For pulmonary and systemic circulation, the heart has to pump blood to the lungs or the rest of the body, respectively. In vertebrates, the lungs are relatively close to the heart in the thoracic cavity. The shorter distance to pump means that the muscle wall on the right side of the heart is not as thick as the left side which must have enough pressure to pump blood all the way to your big toe.</p> <div id="m44805-fs-idm48341552" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44805-fig-ch40_03_01" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.10.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1324" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1324" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_01ab.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_01ab.png"><img class="wp-image-5052" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab.png" alt="Figure_40_03_01ab" width="450" height="413" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab.png 532w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab-300x275.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab-65x60.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab-225x206.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_03_01ab-350x321.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1324">Figure 21.10.&nbsp; The mammalian circulatory system is divided into three circuits: the systemic circuit, the pulmonary circuit, and the coronary circuit.

From the pulmonary circuit, blood re-enters the heart through the left atrium. From the left ventricle, blood re-enters the systemic circuit through the aorta and is distributed to the rest of the body.

Since the right side of the heart sends blood to the pulmonary circuit it is smaller than the left side which must send blood out to the whole body in the systemic circuit, as shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.11.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1325" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-3-mammalian-heart-and-blood-vessels/#attachment_1325">Figure 21.11</a>. In humans, the heart is about the size of a clenched fist; it is divided into four chambers: two atria and two ventricles. There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The atria are the chambers that receive blood, and the ventricles are the chambers that pump blood. The right atrium receives deoxygenated blood from the <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1770127"></span><strong>superior vena cava</strong>, which drains blood from the jugular vein that comes from the brain and from the veins that come from the arms, as well as from the <strong><span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1770131"></span>inferior vena cava</strong> which drains blood from the veins that come from the lower organs and the legs. In addition, the right atrium receives blood from the coronary sinus which drains deoxygenated blood from the heart itself. This deoxygenated blood then passes to the right ventricle through the <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1770137"></span><strong>atrioventricular valve</strong> or the <strong><span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1770141"></span>tricuspid valve</strong>, a flap of connective tissue that opens in only one direction to prevent the backflow of blood. The valve separating the chambers on the left side of the heart valve is called the biscuspid or mitral valve. After it is filled, the right ventricle pumps the blood through the pulmonary arteries, by-passing the <strong><span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1767724"></span>semilunar valve</strong> (or pulmonic valve) to the lungs for re-oxygenation. After blood passes through the pulmonary arteries, the right semilunar valves close preventing the blood from flowing backwards into the right ventricle. The left atrium then receives the oxygen-rich blood from the lungs via the pulmonary veins. This blood passes through the <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1767730"></span><strong>bicuspid valve</strong> or mitral valve (the atrioventricular valve on the left side of the heart) to the left ventricle where the blood is pumped out through <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1767735"></span><strong>aorta</strong>, the major artery of the body, taking oxygenated blood to the organs and muscles of the body. Once blood is pumped out of the left ventricle and into the aorta, the aortic semilunar valve (or aortic valve) closes preventing blood from flowing backward into the left ventricle. This pattern of pumping is referred to as double circulation and is found in all mammals.</p> <div id="m44805-fs-idm2331712" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44805-fig-ch40_03_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.11.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1325" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1325" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_02ab.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_02ab.png"><img class="wp-image-5053" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1.png" alt="Figure_40_03_02ab" width="500" height="621" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1.png 824w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1-241x300.png 241w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1-768x954.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1-65x81.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1-225x280.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_02ab-824x1024-1-350x435.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1325">Figure 21.11.&nbsp; (a) The heart is primarily made of a thick muscle layer, called the myocardium, surrounded by membranes.

Electrical charges spontaneously pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison.

From the AV node, the electrical impulse enters the bundle of His, then to the left and right bundle branches extending through the interventricular septum. Finally, the Purkinje fibers conduct the impulse from the apex of the heart up the ventricular myocardium, and then the ventricles contract. This pause allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood.

There are three distinct layers, or tunics, that form the walls of blood vessels (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.16.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1331" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-3-mammalian-heart-and-blood-vessels/#attachment_1331">Figure 21.16</a>). The first tunic is a smooth, inner lining of endothelial cells that are in contact with the red blood cells. The endothelial tunic is continuous with the endocardium of the heart. In capillaries, this single layer of cells is the location of diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the endothelial cells and red blood cells, as well as the exchange site via endocytosis and exocytosis. The movement of materials at the site of capillaries is regulated by <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1762848"></span><strong>vasoconstriction</strong>, narrowing of the blood vessels, and <span id="m44805-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1762851"></span><strong>vasodilation,</strong> widening of the blood vessels; this is important in the overall regulation of blood pressure.</p> <p><span id="m44805-fs-idm46223136"></span>Veins and arteries both have two further tunics that surround the endothelium: the middle tunic is composed of smooth muscle and the outermost layer is connective tissue (collagen and elastic fibers). The elastic connective tissue stretches and supports the blood vessels, and the smooth muscle layer helps regulate blood flow by altering vascular resistance through vasoconstriction and vasodilation. The arteries have thicker smooth muscle and connective tissue than the veins to accommodate the higher pressure and speed of freshly pumped blood. The veins are thinner walled as the pressure and rate of flow are much lower. In addition, veins are structurally different than arteries in that veins have valves to prevent the backflow of blood. Because veins have to work against gravity to get blood back to the heart, contraction of skeletal muscle assists with the flow of blood back to the heart.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1331" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1331" style="width: 500px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_07.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_03_07.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5059" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07.jpg" alt="Figure_40_03_07" width="500" height="313" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07.jpg 800w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07-300x188.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07-768x480.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07-65x41.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07-225x141.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_40_03_07-350x219.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1331">Figure 21.16.&nbsp; Arteries and veins consist of three layers: an outer tunica externa, a middle tunica media, and an inner tunica intima.

There is one atrium and one ventricle on the right side and one atrium and one ventricle on the left side. The pumping of the heart is a function of cardiomyocytes, distinctive muscle cells that are striated like skeletal muscle but pump rhythmically and involuntarily like smooth muscle. The internal pacemaker starts at the sinoatrial node, which is located near the wall of the right atrium. Electrical charges pulse from the SA node causing the two atria to contract in unison; then the pulse reaches the atrioventricular node between the right atrium and right ventricle. A pause in the electric signal allows the atria to empty completely into the ventricles before the ventricles pump out the blood. The blood from the heart is carried through the body by a complex network of blood vessels; arteries take blood away from the heart, and veins bring blood back to the heart.</p> <div class="section"><div class="body"><div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>The heart’s internal pacemaker beats by: <ol><li>an internal implant that sends an electrical impulse through the heart</li> <li>the excitation of cardiac muscle cells at the sinoatrial node followed by the atrioventricular node</li> <li>the excitation of cardiac muscle cells at the atrioventricular node followed by the sinoatrial node</li> <li>the action of the sinus</li> </ol> </li> <li>During the systolic phase of the cardiac cycle, the heart is ________. <ol><li>contracting</li> <li>relaxing</li> <li>contracting and relaxing</li> <li>filling with blood</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44805-fs-idm52992688">Cardiomyocytes are similar to skeletal muscle because:</span> <ol><li>they beat involuntarily</li> <li>they are used for weight lifting</li> <li>they pulse rhythmically</li> <li>they are striated</li> </ol> </li> <li>How do arteries differ from veins? <ol><li>Arteries have thicker smooth muscle layers to accommodate the changes in pressure from the heart.</li> <li>Arteries carry blood.</li> <li>Arteries have thinner smooth muscle layers and valves and move blood by the action of skeletal muscle.</li> <li>Arteries are thin walled and are used for gas exchange.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Describe the cardiac cycle.</li> <li><span id="m44805-fs-idm83165984">What happens in capillaries?</span></li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>D</li> <li>A</li> <li>The heart receives an electrical signal from the sinoatrial node triggering the cardiac muscle cells in the atria to contract.

Systolic blood pressure measures the amount of pressure that blood exerts on vessels while the heart is beating. The optimal systolic blood pressure is 120 mmHg. Diastolic blood pressure measures the pressure in the vessels between heartbeats. The optimal diastolic blood pressure is 80 mmHg. Many factors can affect blood pressure, such as hormones, stress, exercise, eating, sitting, and standing.

With each rhythmic pump, blood is pushed under high pressure and velocity away from the heart, initially along the main artery, the aorta. In the aorta, the blood travels at 30 cm/sec. As blood moves into the arteries, arterioles, and ultimately to the capillary beds, the rate of movement slows dramatically to about 0.026 cm/sec, one-thousand times slower than the rate of movement in the aorta. While the diameter of each individual arteriole and capillary is far narrower than the diameter of the aorta, and according to the law of continuity, fluid should travel faster through a narrower diameter tube, the rate is actually slower due to the overall diameter of all the combined capillaries being far greater than the diameter of the individual aorta.</p> <p><span id="m44806-fs-idm47831760"></span>The slow rate of travel through the capillary beds, which reach almost every cell in the body, assists with gas and nutrient exchange and also promotes the diffusion of fluid into the interstitial space. After the blood has passed through the capillary beds to the venules, veins, and finally to the main venae cavae, the rate of flow increases again but is still much slower than the initial rate in the aorta. Blood primarily moves in the veins by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves. Because most veins must move blood against the pull of gravity, blood is prevented from flowing backward in the veins by one-way valves. Because skeletal muscle contraction aids in venous blood flow, it is important to get up and move frequently after long periods of sitting so that blood will not pool in the extremities.</p> <p><span id="m44806-fs-idp97175712"></span>Blood flow through the capillary beds is regulated depending on the body’s needs and is directed by nerve and hormone signals. For example, after a large meal, most of the blood is diverted to the stomach by vasodilation of vessels of the digestive system and vasoconstriction of other vessels. During exercise, blood is diverted to the skeletal muscles through vasodilation while blood to the digestive system would be lessened through vasoconstriction. The blood entering some capillary beds is controlled by small muscles, called precapillary sphincters, illustrated in Figure 21.17. If the sphincters are open, the blood will flow into the associated branches of the capillary blood. If all of the sphincters are closed, then the blood will flow directly from the arteriole to the venule through the thoroughfare channel (see <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.17.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1332" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-4-blood-flow-and-blood-pressure-regulation/#attachment_1332">Figure 21.17</a>). These muscles allow the body to precisely control when capillary beds receive blood flow. At any given moment only about 5-10% of our capillary beds actually have blood flowing through them.</p> </div> <div id="m44806-fs-idm13140240" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44806-fig-ch40_04_01" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.17.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1332" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1332" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_04_01ab.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_40_04_01ab.png"><img class="wp-image-5062" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1.png" alt="Figure_40_04_01ab" width="600" height="192" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1-300x96.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1-768x246.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1-65x21.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1-225x72.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_40_04_01ab-1024x328-1-350x112.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1332">Figure 21.17.&nbsp; (a) Precapillary sphincters are rings of smooth muscle that regulate the flow of blood through capillaries; they help control the location of blood flow to where it is needed.

The loss of the watery plasma creates a hyperosmotic solution within the capillaries, especially near the venules. This causes about 85% of the plasma that leaves the capillaries to eventually diffuses back into the capillaries near the venules. The remaining 15% of blood plasma drains out from the interstitial fluid into nearby lymphatic vessels (<a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;40.18.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1334" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/21-4-blood-flow-and-blood-pressure-regulation/#attachment_1334">Figure 21.18</a>).

Animals with longs necks and those that live in cold environments have distinct blood pressure adaptations.</p> <p><span id="m44806-fs-idp32865760"></span>Long necked animals, such as giraffes, need to pump blood upward from the heart against gravity. The blood pressure required from the pumping of the left ventricle would be equivalent to 250 mm Hg (mm Hg = millimeters of mercury, a unit of pressure) to reach the height of a giraffe’s head, which is 2.5 meters higher than the heart. However, if checks and balances were not in place, this blood pressure would damage the giraffe’s brain, particularly if it was bending down to drink. These checks and balances include valves and feedback mechanisms that reduce the rate of cardiac output. Long-necked dinosaurs such as the sauropods had to pump blood even higher, up to ten meters above the heart. This would have required a blood pressure of more than 600 mm Hg, which could only have been achieved by an enormous heart. Evidence for such an enormous heart does not exist and mechanisms to reduce the blood pressure required include the slowing of metabolism as these animals grew larger. It is likely that they did not routinely feed on tree tops but grazed on the ground.</p> <p><span id="m44806-fs-idp54989552"></span>Living in cold water, whales need to maintain the temperature in their blood. This is achieved by the veins and arteries being close together so that heat exchange can occur. This mechanism is called a countercurrent heat exchanger. The blood vessels and the whole body are also protected by thick layers of blubber to prevent heat loss. In land animals that live in cold environments, thick fur and hibernation are used to retain heat and slow metabolism.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Blood Pressure"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44806-fs-idm7648" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Blood Pressure</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44806-fs-idm39528176"></span>The pressure of the blood flow in the body is produced by the hydrostatic pressure of the fluid (blood) against the walls of the blood vessels. Fluid will move from areas of high to low hydrostatic pressures. In the arteries, the hydrostatic pressure near the heart is very high and blood flows to the arterioles where the rate of flow is slowed by the narrow openings of the arterioles. During systole, when new blood is entering the arteries, the artery walls stretch to accommodate the increase of pressure of the extra blood; during diastole, the walls return to normal because of their elastic properties.

For example, 120/80 indicates a reading of 120 mm Hg during the systole and 80 mm Hg during diastole.

Therefore, cardiac output can be increased by increasing heart rate, as when exercising. However, cardiac output can also be increased by increasing stroke volume, such as if the heart contracts with greater strength. Stroke volume can also be increased by speeding blood circulation through the body so that more blood enters the heart between contractions. During heavy exertion, the blood vessels relax and increase in diameter, offsetting the increased heart rate and ensuring adequate oxygenated blood gets to the muscles. Stress triggers a decrease in the diameter of the blood vessels, consequently increasing blood pressure. These changes can also be caused by nerve signals or hormones, and even standing up or lying down can have a great effect on blood pressure.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Blood primarily moves through the body by the rhythmic movement of smooth muscle in the vessel wall and by the action of the skeletal muscle as the body moves.

This occurs via the processes of urination, defecation, sweating and, to a small extent, respiration. The organs and tissues of the human body are soaked in fluids that are maintained at constant temperature, pH, and solute concentration, all crucial elements of homeostasis. The solutes in body fluids are mainly mineral salts and sugars, and osmotic regulation is the process by which the mineral salts and water are kept in balance.

Isotonic cells have an equal concentration of solutes inside and outside the cell; this equalizes the osmotic pressure on either side of the cell membrane which is a semi-permeable membrane.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1338" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1338" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_01_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_01_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5071" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1.jpg" alt="Figure_41_01_01" width="600" height="329" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1-300x165.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1-768x422.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1-65x36.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1-225x123.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/02/Figure_41_01_01-1024x562-1-350x192.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1338">Figure 22.2.&nbsp; Cells placed in a hypertonic environment tend to shrink due to loss of water.

There is a constant input of water and electrolytes into the system. While osmoregulation is achieved across membranes within the body, excess electrolytes and wastes are transported to the kidneys and excreted, helping to maintain osmotic balance.</p> <div class="section" title="Need for Osmoregulation"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44808-fs-idp54127232" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Need for Osmoregulation</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idp6024352"></span>Biological systems constantly interact and exchange water and nutrients with the environment by way of consumption of food and water and through excretion in the form of sweat, urine, and feces. Without a mechanism to regulate osmotic pressure, or when a disease damages this mechanism, there is a tendency to accumulate toxic waste and water, which can have dire consequences.</p> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idm11703344"></span>Mammalian systems have evolved to regulate not only the overall osmotic pressure across membranes, but also specific concentrations of important electrolytes in the three major fluid compartments: blood plasma, extracellular fluid, and intracellular fluid. Since osmotic pressure is regulated by the movement of water across membranes, the volume of the fluid compartments can also change temporarily. Because blood plasma is one of the fluid components, osmotic pressures have a direct bearing on blood pressure.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44808-fs-idp160208656" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Transport of Electrolytes across Cell Membranes</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idm22780000"></span>Electrolytes, such as sodium chloride, ionize in water, meaning that they dissociate into their component ions. In water, sodium chloride (NaCl), dissociates into the sodium ion (Na<sup>+</sup>) and the chloride ion (Cl<sup>–</sup>). The most important ions, whose concentrations are very closely regulated in body fluids, are the cations sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>), potassium (K<sup>+</sup>), calcium (Ca<sup>+2</sup>),<br /> magnesium (Mg<sup>+2</sup>), and the anions chloride (Cl<sup>–</sup>), carbonate (CO<sub>3</sub><sup>-2</sup>), bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>), and phosphate(PO<sub>3</sub><sup>–</sup>). Electrolytes are lost from the body during urination and perspiration. For this reason, athletes are encouraged to replace electrolytes and fluids during periods of increased activity and perspiration.</p> <p><span id="m44808-eip-152"></span>Osmotic pressure is influenced by the concentration of solutes in a solution. It is directly proportional to<br /> the number of solute atoms or molecules and not dependent on the size of the solute molecules. Because electrolytes dissociate into their component ions, they, in essence, add more solute particles into the solution and have a greater effect on osmotic pressure, per mass than compounds that do not dissociate in water, such as glucose.</p> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idp192669184"></span>Water can pass through membranes by passive diffusion. If electrolyte ions could passively diffuse across membranes, it would be impossible to maintain specific concentrations of ions in each fluid compartment therefore they require special mechanisms to cross the semi-permeable membranes in the body. This movement can be accomplished by facilitated diffusion and active transport. Facilitated diffusion requires protein-based channels for moving the solute. Active transport requires energy in the form of ATP conversion, carrier proteins, or pumps in order to move ions against the concentration gradient.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44808-fs-idp85228080" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Concept of Osmolality and Milliequivalent</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idp16230720"></span>In order to calculate osmotic pressure, it is necessary to understand how solute concentrations are measured. The unit for measuring solutes is the <span id="m44808-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1533673"></span><strong>mole</strong><a id="id837499" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. One mole is defined as the gram molecular weight of the solute. For example, the molecular weight of sodium chloride is 58.44. Thus, one mole of sodium chloride weighs 58.44 grams. The <span id="m44808-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1533678"></span><strong>molarity</strong><a id="id837514" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> of a solution is the number of moles of solute per liter of solution. The <span id="m44808-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1533681"></span><strong>molality</strong><a id="id837529" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> of a solution is the number of moles of solute per kilogram of solvent. If the solvent is water, one kilogram of water is equal to one liter of water. While molarity and molality are used to express the concentration of solutions, electrolyte concentrations are usually expressed in terms of milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L): the mEq/L is equal to the ion concentration (in millimoles) multiplied by the number of electrical charges on the ion. The unit of milliequivalent takes into consideration the ions present in the solution (since electrolytes form ions in aqueous solutions) and the charge on the ions.</p> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idp105917248"></span>Thus, for ions that have a charge of one, one milliequivalent is equal to one millimole. For ions that have a charge of two (like calcium), one milliequivalent is equal to 0.5 millimoles. Another unit for the expression of electrolyte concentration is the milliosmole (mOsm), which is the number of milliequivalents of solute per kilogram of solvent. Body fluids are usually maintained within the range of 280 to 300 mOsm.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44808-fs-idm71869712" style="text-align: left;"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Osmoregulators and Osmoconformers</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44808-fs-idp149727408"></span>Persons lost at sea without any fresh water to drink are at risk of severe dehydration because the human body cannot adapt to drinking seawater, which is hypertonic in comparison to body fluids. Organisms such as goldfish that can tolerate only a relatively narrow range of salinity are referred to as stenohaline. About 90 percent of all bony fish are restricted to either freshwater or seawater. They are incapable of osmotic regulation in the opposite environment. It is possible, however, for a few fishes like salmon to spend part of their life in fresh water and part in sea water. Organisms like the salmon and molly that can tolerate a relatively wide range of salinity are referred to as euryhaline organisms. This is possible because some fish have evolved <span id="m44808-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1459110"></span><strong>osmoregulatory</strong><a id="id837587" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> mechanisms to survive in all kinds of aquatic environments. When they live in fresh water, their bodies tend to take up water because the environment is relatively hypotonic, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;41.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1339" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/22-1-osmoregulation-and-osmotic-balance/#attachment_1339">Figure 22.3</a><span class="bold"><strong>a</strong></span>. In such hypotonic environments, these fish do not drink much water. Instead, they pass a lot of very dilute urine, and they achieve electrolyte balance by active transport of salts through the gills. When they move to a hypertonic marine environment, these fish start drinking sea water; they excrete the excess salts through their gills and their urine, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;41.3.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1339" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/22-1-osmoregulation-and-osmotic-balance/#attachment_1339">Figure 22.3</a><span class="bold"><strong>b</strong></span>. Most marine invertebrates, on the other hand, may be isotonic with sea water ( <span id="m44808-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1246407"></span><strong>osmoconformers</strong><a id="id837636" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>). Their body fluid concentrations conform to changes in seawater concentration. Cartilaginous fishes’ salt composition of the blood is similar to bony fishes; however, the blood of sharks contains the organic compounds urea and trimethylamine oxide (TMAO). This does not mean that their electrolyte composition is similar to that of sea water. They achieve isotonicity with the sea by storing large concentrations of urea. These animals that secrete urea are called ureotelic animals. TMAO stabilizes proteins in the presence of high urea levels, preventing the disruption of peptide bonds that would occur in other animals exposed to similar levels of urea. Sharks are cartilaginous fish with a rectal gland to secrete salt and assist in osmoregulation.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1339" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1339" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_01_02ab.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_01_02ab.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5072" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1.jpg" alt="Figure_41_01_02ab" width="600" height="483" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1-300x241.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1-768x618.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1-65x52.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1-225x181.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_01_02ab-1024x824-1-350x282.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1339">Figure 22.3.&nbsp; Fish are osmoregulators, but must use different mechanisms to survive in (a) freshwater or (b) saltwater environments.

It is the number of solute molecules and not the molecular size that is important in osmosis. Osmoregulation and osmotic balance are important bodily functions, resulting in water and salt balance. Not all solutes can pass through a semi-permeable membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water across the membrane. Osmosis occurs to equalize the number of solute molecules across a semi-permeable membrane by the movement of water to the side of higher solute concentration. Facilitated diffusion utilizes protein channels to move solute molecules from areas of higher to lower concentration while active transport mechanisms are required to move solutes against concentration gradients. Osmolarity is measured in units of milliequivalents or milliosmoles, both of which take into consideration the number of solute particles and the charge on them. Fish that live in fresh water or saltwater adapt by being osmoregulators or osmoconformers.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>When a dehydrated human patient needs to be given fluids intravenously, he or she is given: <ol><li>water, which is hypotonic with respect to body fluids</li> <li>saline at a concentration that is isotonic with respect to body fluids</li> <li>glucose because it is a non-electrolyte</li> <li>blood</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44808-fs-idp141888016"><span id="m44808-fs-idp13725200">The sodium ion is at the highest concentration in:</span></span> <ol><li>intracellular fluid</li> <li>extracellular fluid</li> <li>blood plasma</li> <li>none of the above</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44808-fs-idp150849552"><span id="m44808-fs-idp84793600">Cells in a hypertonic solution tend to:</span></span> <ol><li>shrink due to water loss</li> <li>swell due to water gain</li> <li>stay the same size due to water moving into and out of the cell at the same rate</li> <li>none of the above</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44808-fs-idm22902160"><span id="m44808-fs-idp97189760">Why is excretion important in order to achieve osmotic balance?</span></span></li> <li>Why do electrolyte ions move across membranes by active transport?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>Excretion allows an organism to rid itself of waste molecules that could be toxic if allowed to accumulate.

First, the nephrons filter blood that runs through the capillary network in the glomerulus. Almost all solutes, except for proteins, are filtered out into the glomerulus by a process called <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1696909"></span><strong>glomerular filtration</strong><a id="id839408" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. Second, the filtrate is collected in the renal tubules. Most of the solutes get reabsorbed in the PCT by a process called <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1696913"></span><strong>tubular reabsorption</strong><a id="id839423" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. In the loop of Henle, the filtrate continues to exchange solutes and water with the renal medulla and the peritubular capillary network. Water is also reabsorbed during this step. Then, additional solutes and wastes are secreted into the kidney tubules during <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1696919"></span><strong>tubular secretion</strong><a id="id839438" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which is, in essence, the opposite process to tubular reabsorption. The collecting ducts collect filtrate coming from the nephrons and fuse in the medullary papillae. From here, the papillae deliver the filtrate, now called urine, into the minor calyces that eventually connect to the ureters through the renal pelvis. This entire process is illustrated in Figure 22.7.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1344" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_03_04.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_03_04.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5078" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04.jpg" alt="Figure_41_03_04" width="400" height="458" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04-262x300.jpg 262w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04-65x74.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04-225x258.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_03_04-350x401.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1344">Figure 22.7.&nbsp; Each part of the nephron performs a different function in filtering waste and maintaining homeostatic balance. (1) The glomerulus forces small solutes out of the blood by pressure. (2) The proximal convoluted tubule reabsorbs ions, water, and nutrients from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid, and actively transports toxins and drugs from the interstitial fluid into the filtrate. The proximal convoluted tubule also adjusts blood pH by selectively secreting ammonia (NH3) into the filtrate, where it reacts with H+ to form NH4+. The more acidic the filtrate, the more ammonia is secreted. (3) The descending loop of Henle is lined with cells containing aquaporins that allow water to pass from the filtrate into the interstitial fluid. (4) In the thin part of the ascending loop of Henle, Na+ and Cl- ions diffuse into the interstitial fluid. In the thick part, these same ions are actively transported into the interstitial fluid. Because salt but not water is lost, the filtrate becomes more dilute as it travels up the limb. (5) In the distal convoluted tubule, K+ and H+ ions are selectively secreted into the filtrate, while Na+, Cl-, and HCO3- ions are reabsorbed to maintain pH and electrolyte balance in the blood.

The blood pressure in the glomerulus is maintained independent of factors that affect systemic blood pressure. The “leaky” connections between the endothelial cells of the glomerular capillary network allow solutes to pass through easily. All solutes in the glomerular capillaries, except for macromolecules like proteins, pass through by passive diffusion.

Almost all nutrients are reabsorbed, and this occurs either by passive or active transport. Reabsorption of water and some key electrolytes are regulated and can be influenced by hormones. Sodium (Na<sup>+</sup>) is the most abundant ion and most of it is reabsorbed by active transport and then transported to the peritubular capillaries. Because Na<sup>+</sup> is actively transported out of the tubule, water follows it to even out the osmotic pressure. Water is also independently reabsorbed into the peritubular capillaries due to the presence of aquaporins, or water channels, in the PCT. This occurs due to the low blood pressure and high osmotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries. However, every solute has a <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1782494"></span><strong>transport maximum</strong><a id="id839681" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> and the excess is not reabsorbed.</p> <p><span id="m44809-fs-idp31481312"></span>In the loop of Henle, the permeability of the membrane changes. The descending limb is permeable to water, not solutes; the opposite is true for the ascending limb. Additionally, the loop of Henle invades the renal medulla, which is naturally high in salt concentration and tends to absorb water from the renal tubule and concentrate the filtrate.

The descending limb is water permeable. Water flows from the filtrate to the interstitial fluid, so osmolality inside the limb increases as it descends into the renal medulla. At the bottom, the osmolality is higher inside the loop than in the interstitial fluid. Thus, as filtrate enters the ascending limb, Na+ and Cl- ions exit through ion channels present in the cell membrane. Further up, Na+ is actively transported out of the filtrate and Cl- follows. Osmolarity is given in units of milliosmoles per liter (mOsm/L).</div></div> </div> <div class="body"><div id="m44809-fig-ch41_03_05" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;41.8.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> </div> <p><span id="m44809-fs-idm257462544"></span>Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension.

If the body requires additional water, all of it can be reabsorbed at this point. Further reabsorption is controlled by hormones, which will be discussed in a later section. Excretion of wastes occurs due to lack of reabsorption combined with tubular secretion. Undesirable products like metabolic wastes, urea, uric acid, and certain drugs, are excreted by tubular secretion. Most of the tubular secretion happens in the DCT, but some occurs in the early part of the collecting duct. Kidneys also maintain an acid-base balance by secreting excess H<sup>+</sup> ions.</p> <p><span id="m44809-fs-idm189006512"></span>Although parts of the renal tubules are named proximal and distal, in a cross-section of the kidney, the tubules are placed close together and in contact with each other and the glomerulus. This allows for exchange of chemical messengers between the different cell types. For example, the DCT ascending limb of the loop of Henle has masses of cells called <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1772728"></span><strong>macula densa</strong><a id="id839851" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which are in contact with cells of the afferent arterioles called <span id="m44809-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1772731"></span><strong>juxtaglomerular cells</strong><a id="id839865" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>. Together, the macula densa and juxtaglomerular cells form the juxtaglomerular complex (JGC). The JGC is an endocrine structure that secretes the enzyme renin and the hormone erythropoietin. When hormones trigger the macula densa cells in the DCT due to variations in blood volume, blood pressure, or electrolyte balance, these cells can immediately communicate the problem to the capillaries in the afferent and efferent arterioles, which can constrict or relax to change the glomerular filtration rate of the kidneys.</p> <div id="m44809-fs-idm92532320" class="note career"><div class="title"><div class="body"><h2 class="title">Nephrologist</h2> <p title="Nephrologist">A nephrologist studies and deals with diseases of the kidneys—both those that cause kidney failure (such as diabetes) and the conditions that are produced by kidney disease (such as hypertension).

The nephron is made up of the renal corpuscle and renal tubule.

The nephron filters and exchanges water and solutes with two sets of blood vessels and the tissue fluid in the kidneys.</span></p> <p><span id="m44809-fs-idm195125680">There are three steps in the formation of urine: glomerular filtration, which occurs in the glomerulus; tubular reabsorption, which occurs in the renal tubules; and tubular secretion, which also occurs in the renal tubules.</span></p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about the kidney is false? <ol><li>The renal pelvis drains into the ureter.</li> <li>The renal pyramids are in the medulla.</li> <li>The cortex covers the capsule.</li> <li>Nephrons are in the renal cortex.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following statements about the nephron is false? <ol><li>The collecting duct empties into the distal convoluted tubule.</li> <li>The Bowman’s capsule surrounds the glomerulus.</li> <li>The loop of Henle is between the proximal and distal convoluted tubules.</li> <li>The loop of Henle empties into the distal convoluted tubule.</li> </ol> </li> <li>The macula densa is/are: <ol><li>present in the renal medulla.</li> <li>dense tissue present in the outer layer of the kidney.</li> <li>cells present in the DCT and collecting tubules.</li> <li>present in blood capillaries.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44809-fs-idm115424112">The osmolarity of body fluids is maintained at ________.</span> <ol><li>100 mOsm</li> <li>300 mOsm</li> <li>1000 mOsm</li> <li>it is not constantly maintained</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44809-fs-idm291614256">The gland located at the top of the kidney is the ________ gland.</span> <ol><li>adrenal</li> <li>pituitary</li> <li>thyroid</li> <li>thymus</li> </ol> </li> <li>Loop diuretics are drugs sometimes used to treat hypertension.

The cells of microorganisms like bacteria, protozoa, and fungi are bound by cell membranes and use them to interact with the environment. Some cells, including some leucocytes in humans, are able to engulf food by endocytosis—the formation of vesicles by involution of the cell membrane within the cells. The same vesicles are able to interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment.

Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. There are exchange pumps lining the tubules, which actively transport H<sup>+</sup> ions into the cell and K<sup>+</sup> or Na<sup>+</sup> ions out; water passively follows to form urine. The secretion of ions alters the osmotic pressure which draws water, electrolytes, and nitrogenous waste (uric acid) into the tubules. Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder. Not dissolving wastes in water helps these organisms to conserve water; this is especially important for life in dry environments.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1349" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_02_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_41_02_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5085" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1.jpg" alt="Figure_41_02_03" width="600" height="277" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1-300x139.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1-768x355.jpg 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1-65x30.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1-225x104.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_41_02_03-1024x473-1-350x162.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1349">Figure 22.11.&nbsp; Malpighian tubules of insects and other terrestrial arthropods remove nitrogenous wastes and other solutes from the hemolymph.

The same vacuoles interact and exchange metabolites with the intracellular environment. Cellular wastes are excreted by exocytosis when the vacuoles merge with the cell membrane and excrete wastes into the environment. (2) Flatworms have an excretory system that consists of two tubules. The cells in the tubules are called flame cells; they have a cluster of cilia that propel waste matter down the tubules and out of the body. (3) Annelids have nephridia which have a tubule with cilia. Excretion occurs through a pore called the nephridiopore. Annelids have a system for tubular reabsorption by a capillary network before excretion. (4) Malpighian tubules are found in some species of arthropods. They are usually found in pairs, and the number of tubules varies with the species of insect. Malpighian tubules are convoluted, which increases their surface area, and they are lined with microvilli for reabsorption and maintenance of osmotic balance. Metabolic wastes like uric acid freely diffuse into the tubules. Potassium ion pumps line the tubules, which actively transport out K<sup>+</sup> ions, and water follows to form urine. Water and electrolytes are reabsorbed when these organisms are faced with low-water environments, and uric acid is excreted as a thick paste or powder.

Aldosterone is a mineralocorticoid that regulates sodium levels in the blood. Almost all of the sodium in the blood is reclaimed by the renal tubules under the influence of aldosterone. Because sodium is always reabsorbed by active transport and water follows sodium to maintain osmotic balance, aldosterone manages not only sodium levels but also the water levels in body fluids. In contrast, the aldosterone also stimulates potassium secretion concurrently with sodium reabsorption. In contrast, absence of aldosterone means that no sodium gets reabsorbed in the renal tubules and all of it gets excreted in the urine. In addition, the daily dietary potassium load is not secreted and the retention of K<sup>+</sup> can cause a dangerous increase in plasma K<sup>+</sup> concentration. Patients who have Addison’s disease have a failing adrenal cortex and cannot produce aldosterone. They lose sodium in their urine constantly, and if the supply is not replenished, the consequences can be fatal.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Antidiurectic Hormone"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44828-fs-idm138152048"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Antidiurectic Hormone</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44828-fs-idm135252560"></span>As previously discussed, antidiuretic hormone or ADH (also called <span id="m44828-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1257226"></span><strong>vasopressin</strong><a id="id842806" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>), as the name suggests, helps the body conserve water when body fluid volume, especially that of blood, is low.

A <span id="m44817-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1470649"></span><strong>h</strong><strong>ost</strong><a id="id844958" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the organism that is invaded and often harmed by a pathogen. Pathogens include bacteria, protists, fungi and other infectious organisms. We are constantly exposed to pathogens in food and water, on surfaces, and in the air. Mammalian immune systems evolved for protection from such pathogens; they are composed of an extremely diverse array of specialized cells and soluble molecules that coordinate a rapid and flexible defense system capable of providing protection from a majority of these disease agents.</p> <p><span id="m44817-fs-idm59674416"></span>Components of the immune system constantly search the body for signs of pathogens. When pathogens are found, immune factors are mobilized to the site of an infection. The immune factors identify the nature of the pathogen, strengthen the corresponding cells and molecules to combat it efficiently, and then halt the immune response after the infection is cleared to avoid unnecessary host cell damage. The immune system can remember pathogens to which it has been exposed to create a more efficient response upon re-exposure. This memory can last several decades. Features of the immune system, such as pathogen identification, specific response, amplification, retreat, and remembrance are essential for survival against pathogens. The immune response can be classified as either innate or active. The innate immune response is always present and attempts to defend against all pathogens rather than focusing on specific ones. Conversely, the adaptive immune response stores information about past infections and mounts pathogen-specific defenses.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-success"><h3>Glossary</h3> <dl><dt><strong>host</strong></dt> <dd>an organism that is invaded by a pathogen or parasite</dd> <dt><strong>pathogen</strong></dt> <dd>an agent, usually a microorganism, that causes disease in the organisms that they invade</dd> </dl> </div> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Both the innate and adaptive levels of the immune response involve secreted proteins, receptor-mediated signaling, and intricate cell-to-cell communication. The innate immune system developed early in animal evolution, roughly a billion years ago, as an essential response to infection. Innate immunity has a limited number of specific targets: any pathogenic threat triggers a consistent sequence of events that can identify the type of pathogen and either clear the infection independently or mobilize a highly specialized adaptive immune response. For example, tears and mucus secretions contain microbicidal factors.</p> <div class="section" title="Physical and Chemical Barriers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44820-fs-idp87903728"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Physical and Chemical Barriers</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44820-fs-idp201017536"></span>Before any immune factors are triggered, the skin functions as a continuous, impassable barrier to potentially infectious pathogens. Pathogens are killed or inactivated on the skin by desiccation (drying out) and by the skin’s acidity. In addition, beneficial microorganisms that coexist on the skin compete with invading pathogens, preventing infection. Regions of the body that are not protected by skin (such as the eyes and mucus membranes) have alternative methods of defense, such as tears and mucus secretions that trap and rinse away pathogens, and cilia in the nasal passages and respiratory tract that push the mucus with the pathogens out of the body. Throughout the body are other defenses, such as the low pH of the stomach (which inhibits the growth of pathogens), blood proteins that bind and disrupt bacterial cell membranes, and the process of urination (which flushes pathogens from the urinary tract).</p> <p><span id="m44820-fs-idp41306240"></span>Despite these barriers, pathogens may enter the body through skin abrasions or punctures, or by collecting on mucosal surfaces in large numbers that overcome the mucus or cilia. Some pathogens have evolved specific mechanisms that allow them to overcome physical and chemical barriers. When pathogens do enter the body, the innate immune system responds with inflammation, pathogen engulfment, and secretion of immune factors and proteins.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Pathogen Recognition"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44820-fs-idp93047808"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Pathogen Recognition</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44820-fs-idp203619200"></span>An infection may be intracellular or extracellular, depending on the pathogen. All viruses infect cells and replicate within those cells (intracellularly), whereas bacteria and other parasites may replicate intracellularly or extracellularly, depending on the species. The innate immune system must respond accordingly: by identifying the extracellular pathogen and/or by identifying host cells that have already been infected.

In addition to being released from cells after PAMP recognition, cytokines are released by the infected cells which bind to nearby uninfected cells and induce those cells to release cytokines, which results in a cytokine burst.</p> <p><span id="m44820-fs-idp46077088"></span>A second class of early-acting cytokines is interferons, which are released by infected cells as a warning to nearby uninfected cells. One of the functions of an <span id="m44820-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1281077"></span><strong>interferon</strong><a id="id845557" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is to inhibit viral replication. They also have other important functions, such as tumor surveillance. Interferons work by signaling neighboring uninfected cells to destroy RNA and reduce protein synthesis, signaling neighboring infected cells to undergo apoptosis (programmed cell death), and activating immune cells.</p> <p><span id="m44820-fs-idp208017376"></span>In response to interferons, uninfected cells alter their gene expression, which increases the cells’ resistance to infection. One effect of interferon-induced gene expression is a sharply reduced cellular protein synthesis. Virally infected cells produce more viruses by synthesizing large quantities of viral proteins. Thus, by reducing protein synthesis, a cell becomes resistant to viral infection.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1359" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1359" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_01_03.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_01_03.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5102" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03.jpg" alt="Figure_42_01_03" width="400" height="337" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03-300x253.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03-65x55.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03-225x189.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_01_03-350x295.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1359">Figure 23.4.&nbsp; Interferons are cytokines that are released by a cell infected with a virus.

The metabolic resources of cells infected by some viruses produce proteins that interfere with MHC I processing and/or trafficking to the cell surface. The reduced MHC I on host cells varies from virus to virus and results from active inhibitors being produced by the viruses. This process can deplete host MHC I molecules on the cell surface, which NK cells detect as “unhealthy” or “abnormal” while searching for cellular MHC I molecules.

The complement system is so named because it is complementary to the antibody response of the adaptive immune system. Complement proteins bind to the surfaces of microorganisms and are particularly attracted to pathogens that are already bound by antibodies. Binding of complement proteins occurs in a specific and highly regulated sequence, with each successive protein being activated by cleavage and/or structural changes induced upon binding of the preceding protein(s).

There are two types of adaptive responses: the <span id="m44821-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1278607"></span><strong>cell-mediated immune response</strong><a id="id846816" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which is carried out by T cells, and the <span id="m44821-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1278610"></span><strong>humoral immune response</strong><a id="id846830" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which is controlled by activated B cells and antibodies. Activated T cells and B cells that are specific to molecular structures on the pathogen proliferate and attack the invading pathogen. Their attack can kill pathogens directly or secrete antibodies that enhance the phagocytosis of pathogens and disrupt the infection. Adaptive immunity also involves a memory to provide the host with long-term protection from reinfection with the same type of pathogen; on re-exposure, this memory will facilitate an efficient and quick response.</p> <div class="section" title="Antigen-presenting Cells"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 id="m44821-fs-idm20288224"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Antigen-presenting Cells</span></span></h3> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm83796512"></span>Unlike NK cells of the innate immune system, B cells (B lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that gives rise to antibodies, whereas T cells (T lymphocytes) are a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in the immune response. T cells are a key component in the cell-mediated response—the specific immune response that utilizes T cells to neutralize cells that have been infected with viruses and certain bacteria. There are three types of T cells: cytotoxic, helper, and suppressor T cells. Cytotoxic T cells destroy virus-infected cells in the cell-mediated immune response, and helper T cells play a part in activating both the antibody and the cell-mediated immune responses. Suppressor T cells deactivate T cells and B cells when needed, and thus prevent the immune response from becoming too intense.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm107018592"></span>An <span id="m44821-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1278646"></span><strong>antigen</strong><a id="id846890" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is a foreign or “non-self” macromolecule that reacts with cells of the immune system. Not all antigens will provoke a response. For instance, individuals produce innumerable “self” antigens and are constantly exposed to harmless foreign antigens, such as food proteins, pollen, or dust components. The suppression of immune responses to harmless macromolecules is highly regulated and typically prevents processes that could be damaging to the host, known as tolerance.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm101922000"></span>The innate immune system contains cells that detect potentially harmful antigens, and then inform the adaptive immune response about the presence of these antigens. An <span id="m44821-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1278661"></span><strong>antigen-presenting cell (APC)</strong><a id="id846922" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is an immune cell that detects, engulfs, and informs the adaptive immune response about an infection. When a pathogen is detected, these APCs will phagocytose the pathogen and digest it to form many different fragments of the antigen. Antigen fragments will then be transported to the surface of the APC, where they will serve as an indicator to other immune cells. <span id="m44821-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1278668"></span><strong>Dendritic cells</strong><a id="id846939" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> are immune cells that process antigen material; they are present in the skin (Langerhans cells) and the lining of the nose, lungs, stomach, and intestines. Sometimes a dendritic cell presents on the surface of other cells to induce an immune response, thus functioning as an antigen-presenting cell. Macrophages also function as APCs. Before activation and differentiation, B cells can also function as APCs.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idp80950848"></span>After phagocytosis by APCs, the phagocytic vesicle fuses with an intracellular lysosome forming phagolysosome. Within the phagolysosome, the components are broken down into fragments; the fragments are then loaded onto MHC class I or MHC class II molecules and are transported to the cell surface for antigen presentation, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.8.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1364" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/23-2-adaptive-immune-response/#attachment_1364">Figure 23.8</a>. Note that T lymphocytes cannot properly respond to the antigen unless it is processed and embedded in an MHC II molecule. APCs express MHC on their surfaces, and when combined with a foreign antigen, these complexes signal a “non-self” invader. Once the fragment of antigen is embedded in the MHC II molecule, the immune cell can respond. Helper T- cells are one of the main lymphocytes that respond to antigen-presenting cells. Recall that all other nucleated cells of the body expressed MHC I molecules, which signal “healthy” or “normal.”</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1364" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1364" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_01.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_01.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5109" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01.jpg" alt="Figure_42_02_01" width="400" height="323" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01-300x242.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01-65x52.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01-225x182.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/10/Figure_42_02_01-350x282.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1364">Figure 23.8.&nbsp; An APC, such as a macrophage, engulfs and digests a foreign bacterium.

T and B lymphocytes are also similar in that each cell only expresses one type of antigen receptor. Any individual may possess a population of T and B cells that together express a near limitless variety of antigen receptors that are capable of recognizing virtually any infecting pathogen.

The mammalian adaptive immune system is adept in responding appropriately to each antigen. Mammals have an enormous diversity of T cell populations, resulting from the diversity of TCRs. Each TCR consists of two polypeptide chains that span the T cell membrane, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.12.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1369" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/23-2-adaptive-immune-response/#attachment_1369">Figure 23.12</a>; the chains are linked by a disulfide bridge. Each polypeptide chain is comprised of a constant domain and a variable domain: a domain, in this sense, is a specific region of a protein that may be regulatory or structural. The intracellular domain is involved in intracellular signaling. A single T cell will express thousands of identical copies of one specific TCR variant on its cell surface. The specificity of the adaptive immune system occurs because it synthesizes millions of different T cell populations, each expressing a TCR that differs in its variable domain. This TCR diversity is achieved by the mutation and recombination of genes that encode these receptors in stem cell precursors of T cells. The binding between an antigen-displaying MHC molecule and a complementary TCR “match” indicates that the adaptive immune system needs to activate and produce that specific T cell because its structure is appropriate to recognize and destroy the invading pathogen.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1369" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5114" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05.jpg" alt="Figure_42_02_05" width="400" height="341" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05.jpg 545w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05-300x256.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05-65x55.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05-225x192.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_05-350x299.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1369">Figure 23.12.&nbsp; A T cell receptor spans the membrane and projects variable binding regions into the extracellular space to bind processed antigens via MHC molecules on APCs.</div></div> <div class="section" title="Helper T Lymphocytes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44821-fs-idp94055216"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Helper T Lymphocytes</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm113928624"></span>The T<sub>H</sub> lymphocytes function indirectly to identify potential pathogens for other cells of the immune system. These cells are important for extracellular infections, such as those caused by certain bacteria, helminths, and protozoa. T<sub>H </sub>lymphocytes recognize specific antigens displayed in the MHC II complexes of APCs. There are two major populations of T<sub>H</sub> cells: T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells secrete cytokines to enhance the activities of macrophages and other T cells. T<sub>H</sub>1 cells activate the action of cyotoxic T cells, as well as macrophages. T<sub>H</sub>2 cells stimulate naïve B cells to destroy foreign invaders via antibody secretion. Whether a T<sub>H</sub>1 or a T<sub>H</sub>2 immune response develops depends on the specific types of cytokines secreted by cells of the innate immune system, which in turn depends on the nature of the invading pathogen.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm147444864"></span>The T<sub>H</sub>1-mediated response involves macrophages and is associated with inflammation. Recall the frontline defenses of macrophages involved in the innate immune response.

These pathogens evade attempts by macrophages to destroy and digest the pathogen. When <span class="emphasis"><em>M. tuberculosis</em></span> infection occurs, macrophages can stimulate naïve T cells to become T<sub>H</sub>1 cells.

Similar to T cells, naïve B cells initially are coated in thousands of B cell receptors (BCRs), which are membrane-bound forms of Ig (immunoglobulin, or an antibody). The B cell receptor has two heavy chains and two light chains connected by disulfide linkages. Each chain has a constant and a variable region; the latter is involved in antigen binding. Two other membrane proteins, Ig alpha and Ig beta, are involved in signaling.

In this state, B cells function as APCs. They bind and engulf foreign antigens via their BCRs and then display processed antigens in the context of MHC II molecules to T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. When a T<sub>H</sub>2 cell detects that a B cell is bound to a relevant antigen, it secretes specific cytokines that induce the B cell to proliferate rapidly, which makes thousands of identical (clonal) copies of it, and then it synthesizes and secretes antibodies with the same antigen recognition pattern as the BCRs.

Although T and B cells both react with molecules that are termed “antigens,” these lymphocytes actually respond to very different types of molecules. B cells must be able to bind intact antigens because they secrete antibodies that must recognize the pathogen directly, rather than digested remnants of the pathogen. Bacterial carbohydrate and lipid molecules can activate B cells independently from the T cells.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44821-fs-idp81614496"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm166134096"></span>CTLs, a subclass of T cells, function to clear infections directly. The cell-mediated part of the adaptive immune system consists of CTLs that attack and destroy infected cells. CTLs are particularly important in protecting against viral infections; this is because viruses replicate within cells where they are shielded from extracellular contact with circulating antibodies. When APCs phagocytize pathogens and present MHC I-embedded antigens to naïve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that express complementary TCRs, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells become activated to proliferate according to clonal selection. These resulting CTLs then identify non-APCs displaying the same MHC I-embedded antigens (for example, viral proteins)—for example, the CTLs identify infected host cells.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm62045072"></span>Intracellularly, infected cells typically die after the infecting pathogen replicates to a sufficient concentration and lyses the cell, as many viruses do. CTLs attempt to identify and destroy infected cells before the pathogen can replicate and escape, thereby halting the progression of intracellular infections. CTLs also support NK lymphocytes to destroy early cancers. Cytokines secreted by the T<sub>H</sub>1 response that stimulates macrophages also stimulate CTLs and enhance their ability to identify and destroy infected cells and tumors.</p> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm155343088"></span>CTLs sense MHC I-embedded antigens by directly interacting with infected cells via their TCRs. Binding of TCRs with antigens activates CTLs to release perforin and granzyme, degradative enzymes that will induce apoptosis of the infected cell. Recall that this is a similar destruction mechanism to that used by NK cells. In this process, the CTL does not become infected and is not harmed by the secretion of perforin and granzymes. In fact, the functions of NK cells and CTLs are complementary and maximize the removal of infected cells, as illustrated in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.14.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1371" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/23-2-adaptive-immune-response/#attachment_1371">Figure 23.14</a>. If the NK cell cannot identify the “missing self” pattern of down-regulated MHC I molecules, then the CTL can identify it by the complex of MHC I with foreign antigens, which signals “altered self.” Similarly, if the CTL cannot detect antigen-embedded MHC I because the receptors are depleted from the cell surface, NK cells will destroy the cell instead. CTLs also emit cytokines, such as interferons, that alter surface protein expression in other infected cells, such that the infected cells can be easily identified and destroyed. Moreover, these interferons can also prevent virally infected cells from releasing virus particles.</p> <div id="m44821-fs-idm152251088" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44821-fig-ch42_02_07" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.14.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1371" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_07.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_07.png"><img class="wp-image-5116" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07.png" alt="Figure_42_02_07" width="400" height="344" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07.png 725w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07-300x258.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07-65x56.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07-225x194.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_07-350x301.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1371">Figure 23.14.&nbsp; Natural killer (NK) cells recognize the MHC I receptor on healthy cells.

This tissue functions as the immune barrier and response in areas of the body with direct contact to the external environment. The systemic and mucosal immune systems use many of the same cell types. Foreign particles that make their way to MALT are taken up by absorptive epithelial cells called M cells and delivered to APCs located directly below the mucosal tissue. M cells function in the transport described, and are located in the Peyer’s patch, a lymphoid nodule. APCs of the mucosal immune system are primarily dendritic cells, with B cells and macrophages having minor roles. Processed antigens displayed on APCs are detected by T cells in the MALT and at various mucosal induction sites, such as the tonsils, adenoids, appendix, or the mesenteric lymph nodes of the intestine.

The dendritic cells migrate to an underlying tissue called a Peyer’s patch. Antigen-presenting cells, T cells, and B cells aggregate within the Peyer’s patch, forming organized lymphoid follicles. There, some T cells and B cells are activated. Other antigen-loaded dendritic cells migrate through the lymphatic system where they activate B cells, T cells, and plasma cells in the lymph nodes.

This process can take decades, can cost millions of dollars, and can involve many obstacles along the way. For instance, injected vaccines stimulate the systemic immune system, eliciting humoral and cell-mediated immunity, but have little effect on the mucosal response, which presents a challenge because many pathogens are deposited and replicate in mucosal compartments, and the injection does not provide the most efficient immune memory for these disease agents. For this reason, vaccinologists are actively involved in developing new vaccines that are applied via intranasal, aerosol, oral, or transcutaneous (absorbed through the skin) delivery methods. Importantly, mucosal-administered vaccines elicit both mucosal and systemic immunity and produce the same level of disease resistance as injected vaccines.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1376" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1376" style="width: 200px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_12.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_02_12.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5121 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_12-200x300-1.jpg" alt="Figure_42_02_12" width="200" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_12-200x300-1.jpg 200w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_02_12-200x300-1-65x98.jpg 65w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1376">Figure 23.19.&nbsp; The polio vaccine can be administered orally.

Similarly, the measles and rubella vaccines are being adapted to aerosol delivery using inhalation devices. Eventually, transgenic plants may be engineered to produce vaccine antigens that can be eaten to confer disease resistance. Other vaccines may be adapted to rectal or vaginal application to elicit immune responses in rectal, genitourinary, or reproductive mucosa. Finally, vaccine antigens may be adapted to transdermal application in which the skin is lightly scraped and microneedles are used to pierce the outermost layer. In addition to mobilizing the mucosal immune response, this new generation of vaccines may end the anxiety associated with injections and, in turn, improve patient participation.</p> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="Primary Centers of the Immune System"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44821-fs-idp5824976"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Primary Centers of the Immune System</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44821-fs-idm69896816"></span>Although the immune system is characterized by circulating cells throughout the body, the regulation, maturation, and intercommunication of immune factors occur at specific sites.

However, the adaptive response requires information from the innate immune system to function. APCs display antigens via MHC molecules to complementary naïve T cells. In response, the T cells differentiate and proliferate, becoming T<sub>H</sub> cells or CTLs. T<sub>H</sub> cells stimulate B cells that have engulfed and presented pathogen-derived antigens. B cells differentiate into plasma cells that secrete antibodies, whereas CTLs induce apoptosis in intracellularly infected or cancerous cells. Memory cells persist after a primary exposure to a pathogen. If re-exposure occurs, memory cells differentiate into effector cells without input from the innate immune system. The mucosal immune system is largely independent from the systemic immune system but functions in a parallel fashion to protect the extensive mucosal surfaces of the body.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about T cells is false? <ol><li>Helper T cells release cytokines while cytotoxic T cells kill the infected cell.</li> <li>Helper T cells are CD4+, while cytotoxic T cells are CD8<sup>+</sup>.</li> <li>MHC II is a receptor found on most body cells, while MHC I is a receptor found on immune cells only.</li> <li>The T cell receptor is found on both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+ </sup> T cells.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Based on what you know about MHC receptors, why do you think an organ transplanted from an incompatible donor to a recipient will be rejected?</li> <li>The Rh antigen is found on Rh-positive red blood cells.

The numbers of repeated constant domains in Ig classes are the same for all antibodies corresponding to a specific class.

IgGs, which make up about 80 percent of all antibodies, have heavy chains that consist of one variable domain and three identical constant domains. IgA and IgD also have three constant domains per heavy chain, whereas IgM and IgE each have four constant domains per heavy chain. The variable domain determines binding specificity and the constant domain of the heavy chain determines the immunological mechanism of action of the corresponding antibody class. It is possible for two antibodies to have the same binding specificities but be in different classes and, therefore, to be involved in different functions.</p> <p><span id="m44823-fs-idm60930656"></span>After an adaptive defense is produced against a pathogen, typically plasma cells first secrete IgM into the blood. BCRs on naïve B cells are of the IgM class and occasionally IgD class. IgM molecules make up approximately ten percent of all antibodies. Prior to antibody secretion, plasma cells assemble IgM molecules into pentamers (five individual antibodies) linked by a joining (J) chain, as shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.23.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1380" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/23-3-antibodies/#attachment_1380">Figure 23.23</a>. The pentamer arrangement means that these macromolecules can bind ten identical antigens. However, IgM molecules released early in the adaptive immune response do not bind to antigens as stably as IgGs, which are one of the possible types of antibodies secreted in large quantities upon re-exposure to the same pathogen.

Although avidity measures the strength of binding, just as affinity does, the avidity is not simply the sum of the affinities of the antibodies in a multimeric structure. The avidity depends on the number of identical binding sites on the antigen being detected, as well as other physical and chemical factors. Typically, multimeric antibodies, such as pentameric IgM, are classified as having lower affinity than monomeric antibodies, but high avidity. Essentially, the fact that multimeric antibodies can bind many antigens simultaneously balances their slightly lower binding strength for each antibody/antigen interaction.</p> <p><span id="m44823-fs-idp95317264"></span>Antibodies secreted after binding to one epitope on an antigen may exhibit cross reactivity for the same or similar epitopes on different antigens.

For instance, antibody cross reactivity may occur against the similar surface structures of various Gram-negative bacteria. Conversely, antibodies raised against pathogenic molecular components that resemble self molecules may incorrectly mark host cells for destruction and cause autoimmune damage. Patients who develop systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) commonly exhibit antibodies that react with their own DNA. These antibodies may have been initially raised against the nucleic acid of microorganisms but later cross-reacted with self-antigens.

In the competition between immune protection and pathogen evasion, pathogens have the advantage of more rapid evolution because of their shorter generation time and other characteristics. For instance, <span class="emphasis"><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em></span>(bacterium that cause pneumonia and meningitis) surrounds itself with a capsule that inhibits phagocytes from engulfing it and displaying antigens to the adaptive immune system. <span class="emphasis"><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em></span> (bacterium that can cause skin infections, abscesses, and meningitis) synthesizes a toxin called leukocidin that kills phagocytes after they engulf the bacterium. Other pathogens can also hinder the adaptive immune system. HIV infects T<sub>H</sub> cells via their CD4 surface molecules, gradually depleting the number of T<sub>H</sub> cells in the body; this inhibits the adaptive immune system’s capacity to generate sufficient responses to infection or tumors. As a result, HIV-infected individuals often suffer from infections that would not cause illness in people with healthy immune systems but which can cause devastating illness to immune-compromised individuals. Maladaptive responses of immune cells and molecules themselves can also disrupt the proper functioning of the entire system, leading to host cell damage that could become fatal.</p> <div class="section" title="Immunodeficiency"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44831-fs-idp102177584"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Immunodeficiency</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44831-fs-idp96686640"></span>Failures, insufficiencies, or delays at any level of the immune response can allow pathogens or tumor cells to gain a foothold and replicate or proliferate to high enough levels that the immune system becomes overwhelmed. <strong>Immunodeficiency</strong><a id="id850858" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the failure, insufficiency, or delay in the response of the immune system, which may be acquired or inherited. Immunodeficiency can be acquired as a result of infection with certain pathogens (such as HIV), chemical exposure (including certain medical treatments), malnutrition, or possibly by extreme stress. For instance, radiation exposure can destroy populations of lymphocytes and elevate an individual’s susceptibility to infections and cancer. Dozens of genetic disorders result in immunodeficiencies, including Severe Combined Immunodeficiency (SCID), Bare lymphocyte syndrome, and MHC II deficiencies. Rarely, primary immunodeficiencies that are present from birth may occur. Neutropenia is one form in which the immune system produces a below-average number of neutrophils, the body’s most abundant phagocytes.

In the United States, 20 percent of the population exhibits symptoms of allergy or asthma, whereas 55 percent test positive against one or more allergens. Upon initial exposure to a potential allergen, an allergic individual synthesizes antibodies of the IgE class via the typical process of APCs presenting processed antigen to T<sub>H</sub> cells that stimulate B cells to produce IgE. This class of antibodies also mediates the immune response to parasitic worms. The constant domain of the IgE molecules interact with mast cells embedded in connective tissues. This process primes, or sensitizes, the tissue. Upon subsequent exposure to the same allergen, IgE molecules on mast cells bind the antigen via their variable domains and stimulate the mast cell to release the modified amino acids histamine and serotonin; these chemical mediators then recruit eosinophils which mediate allergic responses. <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;42.26.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1383" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/23-4-disruptions-in-the-immune-system/#attachment_1383">Figure 23.26</a> shows an example of an allergic response to ragweed pollen.

This extreme reaction is known as anaphylactic shock.

As illustrated in Figure 23.27, systemic lupus erythematosus may affect the heart, joints, lungs, skin, kidneys, central nervous system, or other tissues, causing tissue damage via antibody binding, complement recruitment, lysis, and inflammation.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1384" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1384" style="width: 450px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_04_02.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_42_04_02.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5133" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02.jpg" alt="Figure_42_04_02" width="450" height="489" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02-276x300.jpg 276w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02-65x71.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02-225x244.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_42_04_02-350x380.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1384">Figure 23.27.&nbsp; Systemic lupus erythematosus is characterized by autoimmunity to the individual’s own DNA and/or proteins, which leads to varied dysfunction of the organs.

In the animal kingdom, there are innumerable ways that species reproduce. Asexual reproduction produces genetically identical organisms (clones), whereas in sexual reproduction, the genetic material of two individuals combines to produce offspring that are genetically different from their parents. During sexual reproduction the male gamete (sperm) may be placed inside the female’s body for internal fertilization, or the sperm and eggs may be released into the environment for external fertilization. Seahorses, like the one shown in Figure 24.1, provide an example of the latter. Following a mating dance, the female lays eggs in the male seahorse’s abdominal brood pouch where they are fertilized. The eggs hatch and the offspring develop in the pouch for several weeks.</p> </div> </div> </div><div class="ugc part-ugc"></div></div>

Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. <strong>Asexual reproduction</strong><a id="id853048" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> produces offspring that are genetically identical to the parent because the offspring are all clones of the original parent. A single individual can produce offspring asexually and large numbers of offspring can be produced quickly. In a stable or predictable environment, asexual reproduction is an effective means of reproduction because all the offspring will be adapted to that environment. In an unstable or unpredictable environment asexually-reproducing species may be at a disadvantage because all the offspring are genetically identical and may not have the genetic variation to survive in new or different conditions. On the other hand, the rapid rates of asexual reproduction may allow for a speedy response to environmental changes if individuals have mutations. An additional advantage of asexual reproduction is that colonization of new habitats may be easier when an individual does not need to find a mate to reproduce.</p> <p><span id="m44836-fs-idp65336640"></span>During <span id="m44836-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1265060"></span><strong>sexual reproduction</strong><a id="id853076" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> the genetic material of two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring that differ from their parents. The genetic diversity of sexually produced offspring is thought to give species a better chance of surviving in an unpredictable or changing environment.

Parthenogenesis occurs in invertebrates such as water flees, rotifers, aphids, stick insects, some ants, wasps, and bees. Bees use parthenogenesis to produce haploid males (drones) and diploid females (workers). If an egg is fertilized, a queen is produced. The queen bee controls the reproduction of the hive bees to regulate the type of bee produced.</p> <p><span id="m44836-fs-idm106900496"></span>Some vertebrate animals—such as certain reptiles, amphibians, and fish—also reproduce through parthenogenesis.

Homozygous for Z (ZZ) results in a male and heterozygous (ZW) results in a female. The W appears to be essential in determining the sex of the individual, similar to the Y chromosome in mammals. Some fish, crustaceans, insects (such as butterflies and moths), and reptiles use this system.</p> <p><span id="m44836-fs-idm72903392"></span>The sex of some species is not determined by genetics but by some aspect of the environment. Sex determination in some crocodiles and turtles, for example, is often dependent on the temperature during critical periods of egg development. This is referred to as environmental sex determination, or more specifically as temperature-dependent sex determination. In many turtles, cooler temperatures during egg incubation produce males and warm temperatures produce females. In some crocodiles, moderate temperatures produce males and both warm and cool temperatures produce females. In some species, sex is both genetic- and temperature-dependent.</p> <p><span id="m44836-fs-idm117915392"></span>Individuals of some species change their sex during their lives, alternating between male and female. If the individual is female first, it is termed protogyny or “first female,” if it is male first, its termed protandry or “first male.” Oysters, for example, are born male, grow, and become female and lay eggs; some oyster species change sex multiple times.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Reproduction may be asexual when one individual produces genetically identical offspring, or sexual when the genetic material from two individuals is combined to produce genetically diverse offspring. Asexual reproduction occurs through fission, budding, and fragmentation. Sexual reproduction may mean the joining of sperm and eggs within animals’ bodies or it may mean the release of sperm and eggs into the environment. An individual may be one sex, or both; it may start out as one sex and switch during its life, or it may stay male or female.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which form of reproduction is thought to be best in a stable environment? <ol><li>asexual</li> <li>sexual</li> <li>budding</li> <li>parthenogenesis</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44836-fs-idm52177824"><span id="m44836-fs-idm92824816">Which form of reproduction can result from damage to the original animal?</span></span> <ol><li>asexual</li> <li>fragmentation</li> <li>budding</li> <li>parthenogenesis</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44836-fs-idm131435392"><span id="m44836-fs-idp37718208">Which form of reproduction is useful to an animal with little mobility that reproduces sexually?</span></span> <ol><li>fission</li> <li>budding</li> <li>parthenogenesis</li> <li>hermaphroditism</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44836-fs-idm14787616"><span id="m44836-fs-idm50440816">Genetically unique individuals are produced through ________.</span></span> <ol><li>sexual reproduction</li> <li>parthenogenesis</li> <li>budding</li> <li>fragmentation</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44836-fs-idm125571248"><span id="m44836-fs-idp48007760">Why is sexual reproduction useful if only half the animals can produce offspring and two separate cells must be combined to form a third?</span></span></li> <li><span id="m44836-fs-idm72951504"><span id="m44836-fs-idm3893312">What determines which sex will result in offspring of birds and mammals?</span></span></li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>A</li> <li>Sexual reproduction produces a new combination of genes in the offspring that may better enable them to survive changes in the environment and assist in the survival of the species.</li> <li>The presence of the W chromosome in birds determines femaleness and the presence of the Y chromosome in mammals determines maleness.

This allows the female to select a particular male. The trigger for egg and sperm release (spawning) causes the egg and sperm to be placed in a small area, enhancing the possibility of fertilization.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp91036784"></span>External fertilization in an aquatic environment protects the eggs from drying out. Broadcast spawning can result in a greater mixture of the genes within a group, leading to higher genetic diversity and a greater chance of species survival in a hostile environment. For sessile aquatic organisms like sponges, broadcast spawning is the only mechanism for fertilization and colonization of new environments. The presence of the fertilized eggs and developing young in the water provides opportunities for predation resulting in a loss of offspring. Therefore, millions of eggs must be produced by individuals, and the offspring produced through this method must mature rapidly. The survival rate of eggs produced through broadcast spawning is low.</p> <div class="section" title="Internal Fertilization"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44838-fs-idp213962832"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Internal Fertilization</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp50044176"></span>Internal fertilization occurs most often in land-based animals, although some aquatic animals also use this method. There are three ways that offspring are produced following internal fertilization. In <span id="m44838-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1484397"></span><strong>oviparity</strong><a id="id854338" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, fertilized eggs are laid outside the female’s body and develop there, receiving nourishment from the yolk that is a part of the egg. This occurs in most bony fish, many reptiles, some cartilaginous fish, most amphibians, two mammals, and all birds. Reptiles and insects produce leathery eggs, while birds and turtles produce eggs with high concentrations of calcium carbonate in the shell, making them hard. Chicken eggs are an example of this second type.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp138952624"></span>In <span id="m44838-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1484410"></span><strong>ovoviparity</strong><a id="id854368" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, fertilized eggs are retained in the female, but the embryo obtains its nourishment from the egg’s yolk and the young are fully developed when they are hatched. This occurs in some bony fish (like the guppy <span class="emphasis"><em>Lebistes reticulatus</em></span>), some sharks, some lizards, some snakes (such as the garter snake <span class="emphasis"><em>Thamnophis sirtalis</em></span>), some vipers, and some invertebrate animals (like the Madagascar hissing cockroach <span class="emphasis"><em>Gromphadorhina portentosa</em></span>).</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp133650208"></span>In <span id="m44838-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1562283"></span><strong>viviparity</strong><a id="id854412" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> the young develop within the female, receiving nourishment from the mother’s blood through a placenta. The offspring develops in the female and is born alive. This occurs in most mammals, some cartilaginous fish, and a few reptiles.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp60226992"></span>Internal fertilization has the advantage of protecting the fertilized egg from dehydration on land. The embryo is isolated within the female, which limits predation on the young. Internal fertilization enhances the fertilization of eggs by a specific male. Fewer offspring are produced through this method, but their survival rate is higher than that for external fertilization.</p> </div> </div> <div class="section" title="The Evolution of Reproduction"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44838-fs-idp238489680"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">The Evolution of Reproduction</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp95831472"></span>Once multicellular organisms evolved and developed specialized cells, some also developed tissues and organs with specialized functions. An early development in reproduction occurred in the Annelids. These organisms produce sperm and eggs from undifferentiated cells in their coelom and store them in that cavity. When the coelom becomes filled, the cells are released through an excretory opening or by the body splitting open. Reproductive organs evolved with the development of gonads that produce sperm and eggs. These cells went through meiosis, an adaption of mitosis, which reduced the number of chromosomes in each reproductive cell by half, while increasing the number of cells through cell division.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp69442064"></span>Complete reproductive systems were developed in insects, with separate sexes. Sperm are made in testes and then travel through coiled tubes to the epididymis for storage. Eggs mature in the ovary. When they are released from the ovary, they travel to the uterine tubes for fertilization. Some insects have a specialized sac, called a <span id="m44838-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1648233"></span><strong>spermatheca</strong><a id="id854473" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, which stores sperm for later use, sometimes up to a year. Fertilization can be timed with environmental or food conditions that are optimal for offspring survival.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp228998448"></span>Vertebrates have similar structures, with a few differences. Non-mammals, such as birds and reptiles, have a common body opening, called a <span id="m44838-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1648245"></span><strong>cloaca</strong><a id="id854496" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a>, for the digestive, excretory and reproductive systems. Coupling between birds usually involves positioning the cloaca openings opposite each other for transfer of sperm. Mammals have separate openings for the systems in the female and a uterus for support of developing offspring. The uterus has two chambers in species that produce large numbers of offspring at a time, while species that produce one offspring, such as primates, have a single uterus.</p> <p><span id="m44838-fs-idp55667440"></span>Sperm transfer from the male to the female during reproduction ranges from releasing the sperm into the watery environment for external fertilization, to the joining of cloaca in birds, to the development of a penis for direct delivery into the female’s vagina in mammals.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Sexual reproduction starts with the combination of a sperm and an egg in a process called fertilization. This can occur either outside the bodies or inside the female. Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. Once fertilized, the eggs can develop inside the female or outside. If the egg develops outside the body, it usually has a protective covering over it. Animal anatomy evolved various ways to fertilize, hold, or expel the egg. The method of fertilization varies among animals. Some species release the egg and sperm into the environment, some species retain the egg and receive the sperm into the female body and then expel the developing embryo covered with shell, while still other species retain the developing offspring through the gestation period.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>External fertilization occurs in which type of environment? <ol><li>aquatic</li> <li>forested</li> <li>savanna</li> <li>steppe</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which term applies to egg development within the female with nourishment derived from a yolk? <ol><li>oviparity</li> <li>viviparity</li> <li>ovoviparity</li> <li>ovovoparity</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which term applies to egg development outside the female with nourishment derived from a yolk? <ol><li>oviparity</li> <li>viviparity</li> <li>ovoviparity</li> <li>ovovoparity</li> </ol> </li> <li>What are the advantages and disadvantages of external and internal forms of fertilization?</li> <li>Why would paired external fertilization be preferable to group spawning?</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>A</li> <li>C</li> <li>A</li> <li>External fertilization can create large numbers of offspring without requiring specialized delivery or reproductive support organs.

The penis contains three tubes of erectile tissue running through the length of the organ. These consist of a pair of tubes on the dorsal side, called the corpus cavernosum, and a single tube of tissue on the ventral side, called the corpus spongiosum. This tissue will become engorged with blood, becoming erect and hard, in preparation for intercourse. The organ is inserted into the vagina culminating with an ejaculation. During intercourse, the smooth muscle sphincters at the opening to the renal bladder close and prevent urine from entering the penis. An orgasm is a two-stage process: first, glands and accessory organs connected to the testes contract, then semen (containing sperm) is expelled through the urethra during ejaculation. After intercourse, the blood drains from the erectile tissue and the penis becomes flaccid.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm44810000"></span>The walnut-shaped <span id="m44839-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1492129"></span><strong>prostate gland</strong><a id="id855473" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> surrounds the urethra, the connection to the urinary bladder. It has a series of short ducts that directly connect to the urethra. The gland is a mixture of smooth muscle and glandular tissue. The muscle provides much of the force needed for ejaculation to occur. The glandular tissue makes a thin, milky fluid that contains citrate (a nutrient), enzymes, and prostate specific antigen (PSA). PSA is a proteolytic enzyme that helps to liquefy the ejaculate several minutes after release from the male. Prostate gland secretions account for about 30 percent of the bulk of semen.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm28053856"></span>The <span id="m44839-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1655310"></span><strong>bulbourethral gland</strong>, or Cowper’s gland, releases its secretion prior to the release of the bulk of the semen. It neutralizes any acid residue in the urethra left over from urine. This usually accounts for a couple of drops of fluid in the total ejaculate and may contain a few sperm. Withdrawal of the penis from the vagina before ejaculation to prevent pregnancy may not work if sperm are present in the bulbourethral gland secretions.

When an egg is released at ovulation, the fimbrae help the non-motile egg enter into the tube and passage to the uterus. The walls of the oviducts are ciliated and are made up mostly of smooth muscle. The cilia beat toward the middle, and the smooth muscle contracts in the same direction, moving the egg toward the uterus. Fertilization usually takes place within the oviducts and the developing embryo is moved toward the uterus for development. It usually takes the egg or embryo a week to travel through the oviduct. Sterilization in women is called a tubal ligation; it is analogous to a vasectomy in males in that the oviducts are severed and sealed.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm129111088"></span>The uterus is a structure about the size of a woman’s fist. This is lined with an endometrium rich in blood vessels and mucus glands. The uterus supports the developing embryo and fetus during gestation. The thickest portion of the wall of the uterus is made of smooth muscle. Contractions of the smooth muscle in the uterus aid in passing the baby through the vagina during labor. A portion of the lining of the uterus sloughs off during each menstrual period, and then builds up again in preparation for an implantation. Part of the uterus, called the cervix, protrudes into the top of the vagina. The cervix functions as the birth canal.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm132496144"></span>The <span id="m44839-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1554248"></span><strong>vagina</strong><a id="id856182" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is a muscular tube that serves several purposes.

Both sexes experience sexual arousal through psychological and physical stimulation. There are four phases of the sexual response. During phase one, called excitement, vasodilation leads to vasocongestion in erectile tissues in both men and women. The nipples, clitoris, labia, and penis engorge with blood and become enlarged. Vaginal secretions are released to lubricate the vagina to facilitate intercourse. During the second phase, called the plateau, stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm145057744"></span>During phase three, or orgasm, rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur in both sexes. In the male, the reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict placing semen in the urethra, then the urethra contracts expelling the semen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each. During phase four, or resolution, the processes described in the first three phases reverse themselves and return to their normal state. Men experience a refractory period in which they cannot maintain an erection or ejaculate for a period of time ranging from minutes to hours.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44839-fs-idm269814240"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Gametogenesis (Spermatogenesis and Oogenesis)</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idm56727168"></span>Gametogenesis, the production of sperm and eggs, takes place through the process of meiosis. During meiosis, two cell divisions separate the paired chromosomes in the nucleus and then separate the chromatids that were made during an earlier stage of the cell’s life cycle. Meiosis produces haploid cells with half of each pair of chromosomes normally found in diploid cells.

This cell will start the first meiotic division and be arrested in its progress in the first prophase stage. At the time of birth, all future eggs are in the prophase stage. At adolescence, anterior pituitary hormones cause the development of a number of follicles in an ovary. This results in the primary oocyte finishing the first meiotic division. The cell divides unequally, with most of the cellular material and organelles going to one cell, called a secondary oocyte, and only one set of chromosomes and a small amount of cytoplasm going to the other cell. This second cell is called a polar body and usually dies. A secondary meiotic arrest occurs, this time at the metaphase II stage. At ovulation, this secondary oocyte will be released and travel toward the uterus through the oviduct. If the secondary oocyte is fertilized, the cell continues through the meiosis II, producing a second polar body and a fertilized egg containing all 46 chromosomes of a human being, half of them coming from the sperm.</p> <p><span id="m44839-fs-idp26863632"></span>Egg production begins before birth, is arrested during meiosis until puberty, and then individual cells continue through at each menstrual cycle.

The reproductive structures that evolved in land animals allow males and females to mate, fertilize internally, and support the growth and development of offspring. Processes developed to produce reproductive cells that had exactly half the number of chromosomes of each parent so that new combinations would have the appropriate amount of genetic material. Gametogenesis, the production of sperm (spermatogenesis) and eggs (oogenesis), takes place through the process of meiosis.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about the male reproductive system is false? <ol><li>The vas deferens carries sperm from the testes to the penis.</li> <li>Sperm mature in seminiferous tubules in the testes.</li> <li>Both the prostate and the bulbourethral glands produce components of the semen.</li> <li>The prostate gland is located in the testes.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44839-fs-idm103156896">Sperm are produced in the ________.</span> <ol><li>scrotum</li> <li>seminal vesicles</li> <li>seminiferous tubules</li> <li>prostate gland</li> </ol> </li> <li>Most of the bulk of semen is made by the ________. <ol><li>scrotum</li> <li>seminal vesicles</li> <li>seminiferous tubules</li> <li>prostate gland</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following cells in spermatogenesis is diploid? <ol><li>primary spermatocyte</li> <li>secondary spermatocyte</li> <li>spermatid</li> <li>sperm</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which female organ has the same embryonic origin as the penis? <ol><li>clitoris</li> <li>labia majora</li> <li>greater vestibular glands</li> <li>vagina</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which female organ has an endometrial lining that will support a developing baby? <ol><li>labia minora</li> <li>breast</li> <li>ovaries</li> <li>uterus</li> </ol> </li> <li>How many eggs are produced as a result of one meiotic series of cell divisions? <ol><li>one</li> <li>two</li> <li>three</li> <li>four</li> </ol> </li> <li>Describe the phases of the human sexual response.</li> <li>Compare spermatogenesis and oogenesis as to timing of the processes and the number and type of cells finally produced.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>D</li> <li>C</li> <li>C</li> <li>A</li> <li>A</li> <li>D</li> <li>A</li> <li>In phase one (excitement), vasodilation leads to vasocongestion and enlargement of erectile tissues.

In phase two (plateau), stimulation continues, the outer third of the vaginal wall enlarges with blood, and breathing and heart rate increase. In phase three (orgasm), rhythmic, involuntary contractions of muscles occur. In the male, reproductive accessory glands and tubules constrict, depositing semen in the urethra; then, the urethra contracts, expelling the semen through the penis. In women, the uterus and vaginal muscles contract in waves that may last slightly less than a second each.

Slowly rising levels of FSH and LH cause the growth of follicles on the surface of the ovary. This process prepares the egg for ovulation. As the follicles grow, they begin releasing estrogens and a low level of progesterone. Progesterone maintains the endometrium to help ensure pregnancy. The trip through the fallopian tube takes about seven days. At this stage of development, called the morula, there are 30-60 cells. If pregnancy implantation does not occur, the lining is sloughed off. After about five days, estrogen levels rise and the menstrual cycle enters the proliferative phase. The endometrium begins to regrow, replacing the blood vessels and glands that deteriorated during the end of the last cycle.</p> <div id="m44841-fs-idp6751792" class="note art-connection"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44841-fig-ch43_04_02" class="figure" title="Figure&nbsp;43.15.&nbsp;"><div class="body"><div class="mediaobject"></div> <div class="mediaobject"><div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1402" style="width: 600px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_43_04_02f.png" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_43_04_02f.png"><img class="wp-image-5160" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f.png" alt="Figure_43_04_02f" width="600" height="609" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f.png 950w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f-296x300.png 296w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f-768x779.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f-65x66.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f-225x228.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_04_02f-350x355.png 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1402">Figure 24.15.&nbsp; The ovarian and menstrual cycles of female reproduction are regulated by hormones produced by the hypothalamus, pituitary, and ovaries.</div></div> </div> <p><span id="m44841-fs-idm12233456"></span>Which of the following statements about hormone regulation of the female reproductive cycle is false?</p> <div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem">LH and FSH are produced in the pituitary, and estradiol and progesterone are produced in the ovaries.</li> <li class="listitem">Estradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the endometrium to thicken.</li> <li class="listitem">Both progesterone and estradiol are produced by the follicles.</li> <li class="listitem">Secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus is inhibited by low levels of estradiol but stimulated by high levels of estradiol.</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44841-fs-idp22451904"></span>Just prior to the middle of the cycle (approximately day 14), the high level of estrogen causes FSH and especially LH to rise rapidly, then fall.

The luteal and secretory phases refer to changes in the ruptured follicle. The cells in the follicle undergo physical changes and produce a structure called a corpus luteum. The corpus luteum produces estrogen and progesterone. The progesterone facilitates the regrowth of the uterine lining and inhibits the release of further FSH and LH. The uterus is being prepared to accept a fertilized egg, should it occur during this cycle. The inhibition of FSH and LH prevents any further eggs and follicles from developing, while the progesterone is elevated. The level of estrogen produced by the corpus luteum increases to a steady level for the next few days.</p> <p><span id="m44841-fs-idm149795664"></span>If no fertilized egg is implanted into the uterus, the corpus luteum degenerates and the levels of estrogen and progesterone decrease. The endometrium begins to degenerate as the progesterone levels drop, initiating the next menstrual cycle. The decrease in progesterone also allows the hypothalamus to send GnRH to the anterior pituitary, releasing FSH and LH and starting the cycles again.

Estrogen is involved in calcium metabolism and, without it, blood levels of calcium decrease. To replenish the blood, calcium is lost from bone which may decrease the bone density and lead to osteoporosis. Supplementation of estrogen in the form of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can prevent bone loss, but the therapy can have negative side effects. While HRT is thought to give some protection from colon cancer, osteoporosis, heart disease, macular degeneration, and possibly depression, its negative side effects include increased risk of: stroke or heart attack, blood clots, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, endometrial cancer, gall bladder disease, and possibly dementia.</p> <div id="m44841-fs-idm28103312" class="note career"><div class="title"><div class="body"><h2 class="title">Reproductive Endocrinologist</h2> <p>A reproductive endocrinologist is a physician who treats a variety of hormonal disorders related to reproduction and infertility in both men and women. The disorders include menstrual problems, infertility, pregnancy loss, sexual dysfunction, and menopause. Doctors may use fertility drugs, surgery, or assisted reproductive techniques (ART) in their therapy. ART involves the use of procedures to manipulate the egg or sperm to facilitate reproduction, such as <span class="emphasis"><em>in vitro</em></span> fertilization.</p> <p><span id="m44841-fs-idm74481808"></span>Reproductive endocrinologists undergo extensive medical training, first in a four-year residency in obstetrics and gynecology, then in a three-year fellowship in reproductive endocrinology. To be board certified in this area, the physician must pass written and oral exams in both areas.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <p style="text-align: left;">The male and female reproductive cycles are controlled by hormones released from the hypothalamus and anterior pituitary as well as hormones from reproductive tissues and organs. The hypothalamus monitors the need for the FSH and LH hormones made and released from the anterior pituitary. FSH and LH affect reproductive structures to cause the formation of sperm and the preparation of eggs for release and possible fertilization. In the male, FSH and LH stimulate Sertoli cells and interstitial cells of Leydig in the testes to facilitate sperm production. The Leydig cells produce testosterone, which also is responsible for the secondary sexual characteristics of males. In females, FSH and LH cause estrogen and progesterone to be produced. They regulate the female reproductive system which is divided into the ovarian cycle and the menstrual cycle. Menopause occurs when the ovaries lose their sensitivity to FSH and LH and the female reproductive cycles slow to a stop.</p> <div class="textbox exercises"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li>Which of the following statements about hormone regulation of the female reproductive cycle is false? <ol><li>LH and FSH are produced in the pituitary, and estradiol and progesterone are produced in the ovaries.</li> <li>Estradiol and progesterone secreted from the corpus luteum cause the endometrium to thicken.</li> <li>Both progesterone and estradiol are produced by the follicles.</li> <li>Secretion of GnRH by the hypothalamus is inhibited by low levels of estradiol but stimulated by high levels of estradiol.</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which of the following statements about the menstrual cycle is false? <ol><li>Progesterone levels rise during the luteal phase of the ovarian cycle and the secretory phase of the uterine cycle.</li> <li>Menstruation occurs just after LH and FSH levels peak.</li> <li>Menstruation occurs after progesterone levels drop.</li> <li>Estrogen levels rise before ovulation, while progesterone levels rise after.</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44841-fs-idp98847168"><span id="m44841-fs-idm63973888">Which hormone causes Leydig cells to make testosterone?</span></span> <ol><li>FSH</li> <li>LH</li> <li>inhibin</li> <li>estrogen</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which hormone causes FSH and LH to be released? <ol><li>testosterone</li> <li>estrogen</li> <li>GnRH</li> <li>progesterone</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which hormone signals ovulation? <ol><li>FSH</li> <li>LH</li> <li>inhibin</li> <li>estrogen</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44841-fs-idm134911664">Which hormone causes the re-growth of the endometrial lining of the uterus?</span> <ol><li>testosterone</li> <li>estrogen</li> <li>GnRH</li> <li>progesterone</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44841-fs-idp67055712"></span>If male reproductive pathways are not cyclical, how are they controlled?</li> <li>Describe the events in the ovarian cycle leading up to ovulation.</li> </ol> <p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>C</li> <li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>C</li> <li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>Negative feedback in the male system is supplied through two hormones: inhibin and testosterone.

The developing embryo must implant into the wall of the uterus within seven days, or it will deteriorate and die. The outer layers of the zygote (blastocyst) grow into the endometrium by digesting the endometrial cells, and wound healing of the endometrium closes up the blastocyst into the tissue.

Toward the end of the third trimester, estrogen causes receptors on the uterine wall to develop and bind the hormone oxytocin. At this time, the baby reorients, facing forward and down with the back or crown of the head engaging the cervix (uterine opening). This causes the cervix to stretch and nerve impulses are sent to the hypothalamus, which signals for the release of oxytocin from the posterior pituitary. The oxytocin causes the smooth muscle in the uterine wall to contract. At the same time, the placenta releases prostaglandins into the uterus, increasing the contractions. A positive feedback relay occurs between the uterus, hypothalamus, and the posterior pituitary to assure an adequate supply of oxytocin. As more smooth muscle cells are recruited, the contractions increase in intensity and force.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp5028160"></span>There are three stages to labor. During stage one, the cervix thins and dilates. This is necessary for the baby and placenta to be expelled during birth. The cervix will eventually dilate to about 10 cm. During stage two, the baby is expelled from the uterus. The uterus contracts and the mother pushes as she compresses her abdominal muscles to aid the delivery. The last stage is the passage of the placenta after the baby has been born and the organ has completely disengaged from the uterine wall. If labor should stop before stage two is reached, synthetic oxytocin, known as Pitocin, can be administered to restart and maintain labor.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idm32921504"></span>An alternative to labor and delivery is the surgical delivery of the baby through a procedure called a Caesarian section. This is major abdominal surgery and can lead to post-surgical complications for the mother, but in some cases it may be the only way to safely deliver the baby.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp53022336"></span>The mother’s mammary glands go through changes during the third trimester to prepare for lactation and breastfeeding. When the baby begins suckling at the breast, signals are sent to the hypothalamus causing the release of prolactin from the anterior pituitary. Prolactin causes the mammary glands to produce milk. Oxytocin is also released, promoting the release of the milk. The milk contains nutrients for the baby’s development and growth as well as immunoglobulins to protect the child from bacterial and viral infections.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Contraception and Birth Control"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44848-fs-idp150225888"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Contraception and Birth Control</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idm98000288"></span>The prevention of a pregnancy comes under the terms contraception or birth control.

The failure rates listed are not the ideal rates that could be realized, but the typical rates that occur. A failure rate is the number of pregnancies resulting from the method’s use over a twelve-month period. Barrier methods, such as condoms, cervical caps, and diaphragms, block sperm from entering the uterus, preventing fertilization. Spermicides are chemicals that are placed in the vagina that kill sperm. Sponges, which are saturated with spermicides, are placed in the vagina at the cervical opening. Combinations of spermicidal chemicals and barrier methods achieve lower failure rates than do the methods when used separately.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp27633600"></span>Nearly a quarter of the couples using barrier methods, natural family planning, or withdrawal can expect a failure of the method. Natural family planning is based on the monitoring of the menstrual cycle and having intercourse only during times when the egg is not available. A woman’s body temperature may rise a degree Celsius at ovulation and the cervical mucus may increase in volume and become more pliable. These changes give a general indication of when intercourse is more or less likely to result in fertilization. Withdrawal involves the removal of the penis from the vagina during intercourse, before ejaculation occurs. This is a risky method with a high failure rate due to the possible presence of sperm in the bulbourethral gland’s secretion, which may enter the vagina prior to removing the penis.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp134497552"></span>Hormonal methods use synthetic progesterone (sometimes in combination with estrogen), to inhibit the hypothalamus from releasing FSH or LH, and thus prevent an egg from being available for fertilization. The method of administering the hormone affects failure rate. The most reliable method, with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, is the implantation of the hormone under the skin. The same rate can be achieved through the sterilization procedures of vasectomy in the man or of tubal ligation in the woman, or by using an intrauterine device (IUD). IUDs are inserted into the uterus and establish an inflammatory condition that prevents fertilized eggs from implanting into the uterine wall.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp155558864"></span>Compliance with the contraceptive method is a strong contributor to the success or failure rate of any particular method. The only method that is completely effective at preventing conception is abstinence. The choice of contraceptive method depends on the goals of the woman or couple. Tubal ligation and vasectomy are considered permanent prevention, while other methods are reversible and provide short-term contraception.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idm11540400"></span>Termination of an existing pregnancy can be spontaneous or voluntary. Spontaneous termination is a miscarriage and usually occurs very early in the pregnancy, usually within the first few weeks. This occurs when the fetus cannot develop properly and the gestation is naturally terminated. Voluntary termination of a pregnancy is an abortion. Laws regulating abortion vary between states and tend to view fetal viability as the criteria for allowing or preventing the procedure.</p> </div> <div class="section" title="Infertility"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44848-fs-idp123381776"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Infertility</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp55796416"></span> <span id="m44848-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1712000"></span><strong>Infertility</strong><a id="id859591" class="indexterm" href="" data-url=""></a> is the inability to conceive a child or carry a child to birth. About 75 percent of causes of infertility can be identified; these include diseases, such as sexually transmitted diseases that can cause scarring of the reproductive tubes in either men or women, or developmental problems frequently related to abnormal hormone levels in one of the individuals. Inadequate nutrition, especially starvation, can delay menstruation. Stress can also lead to infertility. Short-term stress can affect hormone levels, while long-term stress can delay puberty and cause less frequent menstrual cycles. Other factors that affect fertility include toxins (such as cadmium), tobacco smoking, marijuana use, gonadal injuries, and aging.</p> <p><span id="m44848-fs-idp8987904"></span>If infertility is identified, several assisted reproductive technologies (ART) are available to aid conception. A common type of ART is <span class="emphasis"><em>in vitro</em></span> fertilization (IVF) where an egg and sperm are combined outside the body and then placed in the uterus. Eggs are obtained from the woman after extensive hormonal treatments that prepare mature eggs for fertilization and prepare the uterus for implantation of the fertilized egg. Sperm are obtained from the man and they are combined with the eggs and supported through several cell divisions to ensure viability of the zygotes. When the embryos have reached the eight-cell stage, one or more is implanted into the woman’s uterus. If fertilization is not accomplished by simple IVF, a procedure that injects the sperm into an egg can be used. This is called intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and is shown in <a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;43.22.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1410" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-5-human-pregnancy-and-birth/#attachment_1410">Figure 24.22</a>. IVF procedures produce a surplus of fertilized eggs and embryos that can be frozen and stored for future use. The procedures can also result in multiple births.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1410" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1410" style="width: 400px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_43_07_05.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/03/Figure_43_07_05.jpg"><img class="wp-image-5170" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05.jpg" alt="Figure_43_07_05" width="400" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05.jpg 544w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05-300x225.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05-65x49.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05-225x169.jpg 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Figure_43_07_05-350x263.jpg 350w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-1410">Figure 24.22.&nbsp; A sperm is inserted into an egg for fertilization during intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).

The labor process has three stages (contractions, delivery of the fetus, expulsion of the placenta), each propelled by hormones. The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver. The second trimester continues the development of all of the organs and systems. The third trimester exhibits the greatest growth of the fetus and culminates in labor and delivery. Prevention of a pregnancy can be accomplished through a variety of methods including barriers, hormones, or other means. Assisted reproductive technologies may help individuals who have infertility problems.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <ol><li><span id="m44848-fs-idp186757856"><span id="m44848-fs-idm55673552"></span>Nutrient and waste requirements for the developing fetus are handled during the first few weeks by:</span> <ol><li>the placenta</li> <li>diffusion through the endometrium</li> <li>the chorion</li> <li>the blastocyst</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44848-fs-idm14818608">Progesterone is made during the third trimester by the:</span> <ol><li>placenta</li> <li>endometrial lining</li> <li>chorion</li> <li>corpus luteum</li> </ol> </li> <li><span id="m44848-fs-idm94957984"><span id="m44848-fs-idp28583264"></span>Which contraceptive method is 100 percent effective at preventing pregnancy?</span> <ol><li>condom</li> <li>oral hormonal methods</li> <li>sterilization</li> <li>abstinence</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which type of short term contraceptive method is generally more effective than others? <ol><li>barrier</li> <li>horomonal</li> <li>natural family planning</li> <li>withdrawal</li> </ol> </li> <li>Which hormone is primarily responsible for the contractions during labor? <ol><li>oxytocin</li> <li>estrogen</li> <li><span class="emphasis"><em>β</em></span>-HCG</li> <li>progesterone</li> </ol> </li> <li>Major organs begin to develop during which part of human gestation? <ol><li>fertilization</li> <li>first trimester</li> <li>second trimester</li> <li>third trimester</li> </ol> </li> <li>Describe the major developments during each trimester of human gestation.<span id="m44848-fs-idm85386688"></span></li> <li>Describe the stages of labor.</li> </ol> <div id="m44848-fs-idm175851088" class="exercise"><div id="m44848-fs-idp160654912" class="exercise"><div id="m44848-fs-idp71215264" class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44848-fs-idp1063600" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><div class="body"><div id="m44848-fs-idm56956000" class="exercise"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div id="m44848-fs-idp49598240" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>D</li> <li>B</li> <li>A</li> <li>B</li> <li>The first trimester lays down the basic structures of the body, including the limb buds, heart, eyes, and the liver.

Would you select the sex of your child or select for their attractiveness, strength, or intelligence? How far would you go to maximize the possibility of resistance to disease? The genetic engineering of a human child, the production of “designer babies” with desirable phenotypic characteristics, was once a topic restricted to science fiction. This is the case no longer: science fiction is now overlapping into science fact. Many phenotypic choices for offspring are already available, with many more likely to be possible in the not too distant future. Which traits should be selected and how they should be selected are topics of much debate within the worldwide medical community. The ethical and moral line is not always clear or agreed upon, and some fear that modern reproductive technologies could lead to a new form of eugenics.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idp80909632"></span>Eugenics is the use of information and technology from a variety of sources to improve the genetic makeup of the human race. The goal of creating genetically superior humans was quite prevalent (although controversial) in several countries during the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, but fell into disrepute when Nazi Germany developed an extensive eugenics program in the 1930’s and 40’s. As part of their program, the Nazis forcibly sterilized hundreds of thousands of the so-called “unfit” and killed tens of thousands of institutionally disabled people as part of a systematic program to develop a genetically superior race of Germans known as Aryans. Ever since, eugenic ideas have not been as publicly expressed, but there are still those who promote them.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idp254175728"></span>Efforts have been made in the past to control traits in human children using donated sperm from men with desired traits. In fact, eugenicist Robert Klark Graham established a sperm bank in 1980 that included samples exclusively from donors with high IQs. The “genius” sperm bank failed to capture the public’s imagination and the operation closed in 1999.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idm8921872"></span>In more recent times, the procedure known as prenatal genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been developed. PGD involves the screening of human embryos as part of the process of <span class="emphasis"><em>in vitro</em></span> fertilization, during which embryos are conceived and grown outside the mother’s body for some period of time before they are implanted. The term PGD usually refers to both the diagnosis, selection, and the implantation of the selected embryos.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idp237505920"></span>In the least controversial use of PGD, embryos are tested for the presence of alleles which cause genetic diseases such as sickle cell disease, muscular dystrophy, and hemophilia, in which a single disease-causing allele or pair of alleles has been identified. By excluding embryos containing these alleles from implantation into the mother, the disease is prevented, and the unused embryos are either donated to science or discarded. There are relatively few in the worldwide medical community that question the ethics of this type of procedure, which allows individuals scared to have children because of the alleles they carry to do so successfully. The major limitation to this procedure is its expense. Not usually covered by medical insurance and thus out of reach financially for most couples, only a very small percentage of all live births use such complicated methodologies. Yet, even in cases like these where the ethical issues may seem to be clear-cut, not everyone agrees with the morality of these types of procedures. For example, to those who take the position that human life begins at conception, the discarding of unused embryos, a necessary result of PGD, is unacceptable under any circumstances.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idm2792176"></span>A murkier ethical situation is found in the selection of a child’s sex, which is easily performed by PGD. Currently, countries such as Great Britain have banned the selection of a child’s sex for reasons other than preventing sex-linked diseases. Other countries allow the procedure for “family balancing”, based on the desire of some parents to have at least one child of each sex. Still others, including the United States, have taken a scattershot approach to regulating these practices, essentially leaving it to the individual practicing physician to decide which practices are acceptable and which are not.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idp69301008"></span>Even murkier are rare instances of disabled parents, such as those with deafness or dwarfism, who select embryos via PGD to ensure that they share their disability. These parents usually cite many positive aspects of their disabilities and associated culture as reasons for their choice, which they see as their moral right. To others, to purposely cause a disability in a child violates the basic medical principle of <span class="emphasis"><em>Primum non nocere,</em></span> “first, do no harm.” This procedure, although not illegal in most countries, demonstrates the complexity of ethical issues associated with choosing genetic traits in offspring.</p> <p><span id="m44846-fs-idp126739584"></span>Where could this process lead? Will this technology become more affordable and how should it be used? With the ability of technology to progress rapidly and unpredictably, a lack of definitive guidelines for the use of reproductive technologies before they arise might make it difficult for legislators to keep pace once they are in fact realized, assuming the process needs any government regulation at all. Other bioethicists argue that we should only deal with technologies that exist now, and not in some uncertain future. They argue that these types of procedures will always be expensive and rare, so the fears of eugenics and “master” races are unfounded and overstated. The debate continues.</p> </div> </div> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>The early stages of embryonic development begin with fertilization. The process of fertilization is tightly controlled to ensure that only one sperm fuses with one egg. After fertilization, the zygote undergoes cleavage to form the blastula. The blastula, which in some species is a hollow ball of cells, undergoes a process called gastrulation, in which the three germ layers form. The ectoderm gives rise to the nervous system and the epidermal skin cells, the mesoderm gives rise to the muscle cells and connective tissue in the body, and the endoderm gives rise to columnar cells and internal organs.</p> <div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="body"><div id="m44846-fs-idm4742656" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><ol><li><span id="m44846-fs-idp123082400"></span>Which of the following is false? <ol><li>The endoderm, mesoderm, ectoderm are germ layers.</li> <li>The trophoblast is a germ layer.</li> <li>The inner cell mass is a source of embryonic stem cells.</li> <li>The blastula is often a hollow ball of cells.</li> </ol> </li> <li>During cleavage, the mass of cells: <ol><li>increases</li> <li>decreases</li> <li>doubles with every cell division</li> <li>does not change significantly</li> </ol> </li> <li>What do you think would happen if multiple sperm fused with one egg?</li> <li>Why do mammalian eggs have a small concentration of yolk, while bird and reptile eggs have a large concentration of yolk?</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> <div id="m44846-fs-idp11431424" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div id="m44846-fs-idm29987776" class="solution labeled"><div class="title"><div class="body"><div class="body"><div id="m44846-fs-idp6429424" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div><strong>Answers</strong></div> <ol><li>B</li> <li>D</li> <li>Multiple sperm can fuse with the egg, resulting in polyspermy.

Organogenesis is characterized by rapid and precise movements of the cells within the embryo.</p> <div class="section" title="Organogenesis"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 id="m44850-fs-idp168808848"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-autogenerated"><span class="cnx-gentext-section cnx-gentext-t">Organogenesis</span></span></h2> </div> </div> </div> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idp65996928"></span>Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation. During differentiation, the embryonic stem cells express specific sets of genes which will determine their ultimate cell type. For example, some cells in the ectoderm will express the genes specific to skin cells. As a result, these cells will differentiate into epidermal cells. The process of differentiation is regulated by cellular signaling cascades.</p> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idm16832384"></span>Scientists study organogenesis extensively in the lab in fruit flies (<span class="emphasis"><em>Drosophila</em></span>) and the nematode <span class="emphasis"><em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em></span>. <span class="emphasis"><em>Drosophila</em></span> have segments along their bodies, and the patterning associated with the segment formation has allowed scientists to study which genes play important roles in organogenesis along the length of the embryo at different time points. The nematode <span class="emphasis"><em>C.elegans</em></span> has roughly 1000 somatic cells and scientists have studied the fate of each of these cells during their development in the nematode life cycle. There is little variation in patterns of cell lineage between individuals, unlike in mammals where cell development from the embryo is dependent on cellular cues.</p> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idp65133440"></span>In vertebrates, one of the primary steps during organogenesis is the formation of the neural system. The ectoderm forms epithelial cells and tissues, and neuronal tissues. During the formation of the neural system, special signaling molecules called growth factors signal some cells at the edge of the ectoderm to become epidermis cells. The remaining cells in the center form the neural plate. If the signaling by growth factors were disrupted, then the entire ectoderm would differentiate into neural tissue.</p> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idm17573616"></span>The neural plate undergoes a series of cell movements where it rolls up and forms a tube called the <span id="m44850-autoid-cnx2dbk-id1737007"></span><strong>neural tube</strong>, as illustrated in</p> </div> <p><a class="xref target-figure" title="Figure&nbsp;43.28.&nbsp;" href="#attachment_1418" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/chapter/24-7-organogenesis-and-vertebrate-formation/#attachment_1418">Figure 24.28</a>.

(credit: modification of work by NOAA)</div></div> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idp23643616"></span>How are these established? In one of the most seminal experiments ever to be carried out in developmental biology, Spemann and Mangold took dorsal cells from one embryo and transplanted them into the belly region of another embryo. They found that the transplanted embryo now had two notochords: one at the dorsal site from the original cells and another at the transplanted site. This suggested that the dorsal cells were genetically programmed to form the notochord and define the axis. Since then, researchers have identified many genes that are responsible for axis formation. Mutations in these genes leads to the loss of symmetry required for organism development.</p> <p><span id="m44850-fs-idp164017568"></span>Animal bodies have externally visible symmetry. However, the internal organs are not symmetric. For example, the heart is on the left side and the liver on the right. The formation of the central left-right axis is an important process during development. This internal asymmetry is established very early during development and involves many genes. Research is still ongoing to fully understand the developmental implications of these genes.</p> <h2>Summary</h2> <p>Organogenesis is the formation of organs from the germ layers. Each germ layer gives rise to specific tissue types. The first stage is the formation of the neural system in the ectoderm. The mesoderm gives rise to somites and the notochord. Formation of vertebrate axis is another important developmental stage.</p> <div class="title"><div class="title"><div class="bcc-box bcc-info"><h3>Exercises</h3> <div class="section"><div class="body"><div id="m44850-fs-idm29405328" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div class="problem"><ol><li>Which of the following gives rise to the skin cells? <ol><li>ectoderm</li> <li>endoderm</li> <li>mesoderm</li> <li>none of the above</li> </ol> </li> <li>The ribs form from the ________. <ol><li>notochord</li> <li>neural plate</li> <li>neural tube</li> <li>somites</li> </ol> </li> <li>Explain how the different germ layers give rise to different tissue types.</li> <li>Explain the role of axis formation in development</li> </ol> </div> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div class="cnx-eoc free-response"><div id="m44850-fs-idp121762688" class="exercise"><div class="body"><div id="m44850-fs-idp20676832" class="solution labeled"><div class="body"><p><strong>Answers</strong></p> <ol><li>A</li> <li>D</li> <li>Organs form from the germ layers through the process of differentiation.

While the University of Alberta is where my degrees came from, Camosun College is my alma mater. I am pleased to offer this work to all, and especially to my father, Dr. George Molnar, who was and is my scientific inspiration and my life’s model.</p> <h2><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/04/Gair-Jane-2013.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2015/04/Gair-Jane-2013.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-5192" src="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Gair-Jane-2013-240x300-1.jpg" alt="Gair-Jane-2013" width="240" height="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Gair-Jane-2013-240x300-1.jpg 240w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Gair-Jane-2013-240x300-1-65x81.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/biology/wp-content/uploads/sites/96/2021/03/Gair-Jane-2013-240x300-1-225x281.jpg 225w" title="" /></a></h2> <h2>Jane Gair</h2> <p>I have always loved learning and admired the many teachers in my life. They have been my role models and I am proud to call myself a teacher now. I am blessed to be able to teach for three institutions in British Columbia: Camosun College, the University of Victoria, and the University of British Columbia—my alma mater. It gives me great pleasure to know that the many students that I encounter in the classroom and beyond will use this textbook.</p> </div></div>
