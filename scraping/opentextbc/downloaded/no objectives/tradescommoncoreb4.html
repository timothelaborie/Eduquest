Individual trainers are expected to determine the requirements for this test, as required.</li> <li>Throughout the textbook, there may also be links and/or references to other resources that learners will need to access, some of which are only available online.</li> <li>Notes, cautions, and warnings are identified by special symbols. A list of those symbols is provided below.</li> </ul> <h2>Second Edition Changes</h2> <p>In the Winter of 2020, work was done to revise and add content to this book that aligns both with the advancements in technology and the changing face of the skilled trades industry. These changes are predominantly focused on content in B2 through B4 and reflect the ongoing diversification of the trades, with a focus on the use of inclusive language in the text. In addition, this second edition provides more in-depth resources with regard to harassment, conflict resolution, employment-seeking strategies, mentorship, and effective communication skills. In addition, test material in the book was expanded upon to reflect the incorporation of the updated content.</p> <h2>History of the Trades Access Common Core Resources</h2> <p>The concept of identifying and creating resources for skills that are common to many trades has a long history in the Province of British Columbia. This collection of Trades Access Common Core (TACC) resources was adapted from the 15 Trades Common Core line modules co-published by the Industry Training and Apprenticeship Commission (ITAC) and the Centre for Curriculum Transfer and Technology (C2T2) in 2000-2002. Those modules were revisions of the original Common Core portion of the TRAC modules prepared by the Province of British Columbia Ministry of Post-Secondary Education in 1986. The TACC resources are still in use by a number of trades programs today and, with the permission from the Industry Training Authority (ITA), have been utilized in this project.</p> <p>These open resources have been updated and realigned to match many of the line and competency titles found in the Province of BC’s trades apprenticeship program outlines. A review was carried out to analyze the provincial program outlines of a number of trades, with the intent of finding common entry-level learning tasks that could be assembled into this package. This analysis provided the template for the outline used to update the existing modules. Many images found in ITA apprentice training modules were also incorporated into these resources to create books that are similar to what students will see when they continue their chosen trades training. The project team has also taken many new photographs for this project, which are available for use in other trades training resources.</p> <p>The following list of lines and competencies was generated with the goal of creating an entry-level trades training resource, while still offering the flexibility for lines to be used as stand-alone books.

The training of skilled workers dates back to as early as 18th century BC in Babylon. Training for specific trades and crafts was introduced in Europe in the Middle Ages, and from the 11th to 15th centuries, commercial, craft, and merchant guilds spread throughout Europe. During the 19th century, unions were created to protect the interests and rights of each of the trades, and the first documented apprenticeship agreement was created in 1899.</p> <p>During the 20th century, National Occupational Analyses were created, and the apprenticeship system was formalized in every Canadian province. At the start of the 21st century, the major focus shifted to attracting more individuals to the trades to fill the large void that is expected to grow through 2030 because of the retirement of most baby boomers. Another focus has been on creating greater mobility between provinces for journeypersons and apprentices, and greater harmonization and a look toward a pan-Canadian vision of trades training.</p> <p>This Competency provides the information necessary for you to understand the trades training system and how to explore any trades you may be interested in. Careers in the trades can be highly rewarding. Forecast shortages in skilled trades mean that there will be significant opportunities for new workers to enter many of the trades.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Learning Objectives</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>When you have completed the Learning Tasks in this Competency, you should be able to:</p> <ul><li>describe the apprenticeship system</li> <li>describe the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program</li> </ul> </div> </div> <h2>Resources</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-18" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png" alt="Resources icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-350x350.png 350w" title="" />You will be required to reference publications and videos available online.</p> <h3>Media Attributions</h3> <ul><li>“<a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_h0acqnk1" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_h0acqnk1">Line B-4: Introduction</a>” audio recording was generated using NaturalReader Commercial by BCcampus and is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 licence</a>.</li> <li>“<a class="internal" href="https://thenounproject.com/icon/r-178521/" data-url="https://thenounproject.com/icon/r-178521/">R</a>” icon by <a class="internal" href="https://thenounproject.com/nathandavidsmith/" data-url="https://thenounproject.com/nathandavidsmith/">Nathan David Smith</a> is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">CC BY 3.0 licence</a>.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div></div>

It consists of both on-the-job training in industry and technical training. The individual receiving this training is called an “apprentice.”</p> <p>It is estimated that between 80% to 85% of all apprenticeship training occurs with the employer on the job site, and the remaining 15% to 20% is technical training with an approved training provider. Generally, the apprenticeship makes up the largest component of trades training systems in most developed countries, and this model is rapidly being adopted by many developing nations.</p> <p>An apprenticeship is an agreement between an apprentice (individual), an employer, and the authority responsible for trades training, and it outlines the obligations of all three parties. The fourth often unwritten partner to the apprenticeship is the person who provides the technical training. In general, the employer is responsible for ensuring that the paid apprentice works under the supervision of a certified journeyperson who provides the apprentice with on-the- job training and mentorship in their trade. The employer is also responsible for meeting a set of conditions, including ensuring that the apprentice is officially registered with their province or territory, recognizing that further technical training is integral to the apprenticeship program, and tracking and reporting of all time spent on the job site to the relevant authority. The majority of skilled trades have three to four levels of technical training, and an apprenticeship usually lasts between three and six years. Depending on the circumstances, an apprentice may also work for more than one employer during their apprenticeship.</p> <p>The role of the organization responsible for trades training and certification varies depending on the country. In Canada, trades training and certification are the responsibility of individual provinces and territories, so in effect there are 13 different trades training systems. While there are many similarities between the systems, there are also many differences based on the needs of the individual province or territory.</p> <p>There are over 300 different trades in Canada; however, not all are recognized (certified) or taught in each province and territory. The majority of skilled trades fall into four different sectors: construction, transportation, manufacturing, and services. Over 40% of all skilled trades workers in Canada are in construction trades, which include electricians, carpenters, plumbers, pipefitters, and welders, to name a few.</p> <p>In addition to each province and territory having its own trades system, Canada also has a standard of excellence called the “Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program.” Through this program, tradespersons obtain an endorsement on their provincial/territorial certificates by successfully completing an interprovincial exam in or following the final year of their technical training. This endorsement makes it easier for journeyed trades workers to move between provinces/territories and employers. In 2012, over 360 000 apprentices were registered in apprenticeship programs, and over 77% of these individuals were working in one of the 57 Red Seal trades (Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship, 2014).</p> <h2>Exploring trades training</h2> <p>If you are considering going into a trade, it is important to understand what the job is all about. The anticipated shortage of skilled trades workers in Canada has resulted in the creation of numerous websites, videos, and brochures dedicated exclusively to learning about careers in the trades.</p> <p>Another way to learn about trades programs is to contact your local trades training provider and find out what is available for you. Many colleges that offer trades training also offer short exploratory programs into the various trades they teach at their institution, or special initiatives such as entry-level Indigenous Peoples Trades Training, and Women in the Trades. They also offer information sessions, campus visits, or opportunities to talk one-on-one with an instructor or student in a specific trade. Check out the website of your local training provider or call them to get more information.</p> <p>Many high schools also offer exploration into trades training, dual-credential programming, and student apprenticeship programming—along with opportunities for visits to local educational institutions and assistance with career programming.</p> <p>If there is an industry that you’d really like to get into, you might also want to contact an employer or meet with individuals already working in that career to find out first-hand what working in the trade is like—both the rewards and challenges. This can provide you with a better overview of what to expect.</p> <p>The following are just a few resources you should look at to further explore trades training.</p> <h3>Websites</h3> <ul><li><a href="http://www.careersintrades.ca" data-url="http://www.careersintrades.ca">Careers in Trades</a></li> <li><a href="https://youth.itabc.ca/" data-url="https://youth.itabc.ca/">BC Industry Training Authority—Youth Page</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.itabc.ca/discover-apprenticeship-programs/search-programs" data-url="http://www.itabc.ca/discover-apprenticeship-programs/search-programs">BC Industry Training Authority—Trade Programs</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.itabc.ca/women-trades/overview" data-url="https://www.itabc.ca/women-trades/overview">BC Industry Training Authority – Women in Trades</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.itabc.ca/indigenous-peoples-trades/overview" data-url="https://www.itabc.ca/indigenous-peoples-trades/overview">BC Industry Training Authority – Indigenous Peoples in Trades</a></li> <li><a href="http://skillscompetencescanada.com/en/careers/" data-url="http://skillscompetencescanada.com/en/careers/">Skills/Compétences Canada</a></li> <li><a href="https://bccwitt.ca/" data-url="https://bccwitt.ca/">BC Centre for Women In The Trades</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/" data-url="https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/">Trades Training BC</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.itabc.ca/overview/info-employers" data-url="https://www.itabc.ca/overview/info-employers">Supports and Resources: BC Industry Training Authority</a></li> <li><a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/kindergarten-to-grade-12/teach/pdfs/curriculum/appliedskills/2014skills_exploration1012.pdf" data-url="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/assets/gov/education/kindergarten-to-grade-12/teach/pdfs/curriculum/appliedskills/2014skills_exploration1012.pdf">Skills Exploration 10-12: BC Industry Training Authority [PDF]</a></li> <li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403130408/http://tradesrock.com/video_gallery.php" data-url="https://web.archive.org/web/20160403130408/http://tradesrock.com/video_gallery.php">It’s Your Life: Explore a Career in the Resource Trades</a></li> </ul> <h3>Publications</h3> <ul><li><a href="https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/discover/Apprentice%20GB_july2017_FINAL-for%20online.pdf" data-url="https://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/discover/Apprentice%20GB_july2017_FINAL-for%20online.pdf">Apprentice Guidebook: BC Industry Training Authority [PDF]</a></li> <li><a href="https://youth.itabc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ITA_Youth_Trades_Guide_Edition_Three.pdf" data-url="https://youth.itabc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/ITA_Youth_Trades_Guide_Edition_Three.pdf">Trades Guide: BC Industry Training Authority [PDF]</a></li> <li><a href="http://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/discover/Youth/ApprenticeshipOverview_FINAL.pdf" data-url="http://www.itabc.ca/sites/default/files/docs/discover/Youth/ApprenticeshipOverview_FINAL.pdf">Trades Apprenticeship Information: BC Industry Training Authority [PDF]</a></li> </ul> <h3>Jurisdictional training authorities</h3> <p>In addition to researching the trades certified in your own province, you might want to look at those trades that are recognized in other provinces and territories.

Call and ask to meet with someone from the company or talk to them over the phone to find out what they are looking for in an apprentice and if they are aware of any upcoming openings in the company. Be prepared before you contact an employer. They are often very busy and knowing the questions you’d like to ask ahead of time goes a long way to showing that you are respectful of their time. If you set a date or time to meet with an employer, be prompt and always remember to send a thank-you note or email afterwards to acknowledge the time they have given you.

To do so you need information on your industry sponsor as well as your own contact information. You can complete the necessary paperwork online or do it manually and mail it in.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png" alt="Resources icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-350x350.png 350w" title="" /> You can obtain more information on registering your apprenticeship in British Columbia at: <a href="http://www.itabc.ca/apply-apprenticeship/forms" data-url="http://www.itabc.ca/apply-apprenticeship/forms">Forms: How to Register: BC Industry Training Authority</a></div> <h1 id="chapter-30-section-5" class="section-header">Apprenticeship Roles and Responsibilities</h1> <p>The role of the apprentice is to:</p> <ul><li>Read and make sure that they understand all of the requirements of their specific trade.</li> <li>Keep an ongoing dialogue with the journeyperson responsible for their training and any other individuals assisting with their apprenticeship to make sure they are getting feedback on their performance, including their strengths and areas where improvement can be made.</li> <li>Meet with their employer to discuss and determine the best time to arrange for technical training each year for the length of their apprenticeship. In general, most trades have three or four levels of apprenticeship training. Remember that technical training opportunities may be very limited. If possible, register ahead of time for the next two to three years of technical training so that you know that your place has been reserved. Also keep in mind that technical training for some trades may be available from a limited number of training suppliers and are not necessarily located in the city where you live.<br /> You may need to make plans to travel to another city to complete your apprenticeship training. If you have family or other commitments, it may require some time and effort on your part to make the necessary arrangements ahead of time. Advance planning will help reduce your stress level and make you better prepared to complete your training.</li> <li>Keep track of their hours on the job by monitoring the record in the ITA database and bringing to the employer’s attention any discrepancies. On average, employers will update an apprentice’s record every 6 to 12 months.</li> </ul> <p>The role of the employer/sponsor is to:</p> <ul><li>Teach the apprentice the skills required for the trade under the supervision of a certified journeyperson or other qualified individual as approved by the ITA.</li> <li>Provide the apprenticeship with mentorship and constructive feedback on their performance.</li> <li>Work with the apprentice to determine the best time to schedule their technical training each year.</li> <li>Track the apprentice’s hours and report them every 6 to 12 months. If there are any discrepancies, they must review them with the apprentice and make any changes as necessary.</li> <li>Recommend the apprentice for certification when all of their program requirements are complete (technical training certification and hours of experience).</li> </ul> <p>The role of the ITA is to:</p> <ul><li>Manage BC’s industry trades training and certification system, and work with employers, employees, industry, labour, training providers, and governments to increase opportunities in the trades. This includes: <ul><li>managing apprenticeships, setting program standards, issuing credentials, and increasing opportunities in the trades</li> <li>providing information and assistance online, by phone, or in person to apprentices, employers, and other individuals and organizations associated with trades training</li> <li>registering apprentices and employer/sponsors, maintaining apprentice records, overseeing exams and assessments, and funding training at public and private institutions</li> <li>setting standards for skilled trades training programs, training provider requirements, and for challenging certification (when work hours and experience count toward certification)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>The role of the training provider is to:</p> <ul><li>Teach the apprentices according to the competencies detailed in the program description for their program.</li> <li>Provide apprentices with feedback on their performance and prepare them to take the level exams or Interprovincial Red Seal exam at the end of their level of technical training.</li> <li>Work with employers as required to assist in registering and scheduling apprentices for their programs.</li> </ul> <h1 id="chapter-30-section-6" class="section-header">Scheduling Your Technical Training</h1> <p>The following are tips on how to schedule your technical training:</p> <ul><li>Work with your employer to identify the best periods in which to take your technical training. This will ensure that your employer has sufficient employees on site or can make alternate arrangements to get the additional staff needed. Since larger employers may have numerous apprentices, planning will also allow them to stagger technical training across the year.</li> <li>Find out ahead of time if any financial support will be coming from your employer. You may have discussed this at your time of hire, and you may need to revisit it.</li> <li>Try to schedule multiple years of technical training at the onset. The availability of technical training can be very limited in some programs, and your ability to schedule multiple years of training will allow you to complete longer-range plans.</li> <li>Remember that you may have to travel to take your training. Find out where the various approved training providers are for your program so that you can consider this issue when you discuss your training with your employer, family, and friends. It will also allow you to prepare for any additional financial costs with studying away from home or any arrangements you may need to make if you have a family to support.</li> <li>Try to keep on schedule with training. For each year of your apprenticeship you should be doing one level of training. If you fall off schedule, try to get back on as soon as possible.</li> <li>If you’ve changed your employer/sponsor, make sure all the paperwork necessary is completed with the ITA prior to starting your next level of technical training.</li> <li>If you haven’t scheduled your technical training and need to as soon as possible, check with the potential training providers and see if they can add you to a waitlist for upcoming training. You may be provided with only a few days’ warning before a place opens up, so make sure that you’ve discussed this with your employer and any other individuals who would be affected by your quick departure from the job site or home if training is out of town.</li> <li>Do your homework and prepare financially for your studies and be aware of the different sources of funding that can assist you during your technical training and how and when to apply for them.</li> </ul> <h1 id="chapter-30-section-7" class="section-header">Financial Support for Training</h1> <p>Access to financial support is often an integral part of a decision to pursue further education.</p> <p>It’s important to know the sources of funding that may be available to you. Remember to think outside the box to find all of the different funding sources that may be available to you and your particular circumstances.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><img class="alignnone wp-image-18" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png" alt="Resources icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-350x350.png 350w" title="" /> Two very good starting points to look at for funding available for trades training in British Columbia are the Trades Training BC site and the provincial government’s Apprenticeship Training support page:</p> <ul><li><a href="https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/FinancialAssistance" data-url="https://www.tradestrainingbc.ca/FinancialAssistance">Financial Assistance Options for BC Trades Students: Trades Training BC</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.apprenticeonline.gov.bc.ca/Static/HomePage.aspx" data-url="https://www.apprenticeonline.gov.bc.ca/Static/HomePage.aspx">Apprenticeship Training Supports: WorkBC</a></li> </ul> </div> <p>Different types of trades training are eligible for different types of support. For example, longer- term Pre-Apprentice or Foundation trades training at a community college may be eligible for regular provincial student loan programs as well as institutionally specific scholarships and bursaries. While apprentices are not eligible for these resources, they are eligible for other types of support, including employment insurance during their studies.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><img class="alignnone wp-image-18" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png" alt="Resources icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-350x350.png 350w" title="" /> Another source of information about apprenticeship support is the Government of Canada webpage: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/apprentices.html" data-url="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/apprentices.html">Support for Apprentices: Government of Canada</a></div> <p>Apprentices should also find out if their employers offer any kind of training support. If you did not discuss this at the time of hiring, ask your employer now if any kind of professional development funds are available and can be used toward your studies. Depending on your employer, this can range from no financial support to full financial support, covering the costs of your studies and textbooks upon successful completion of your program. In addition, some employers also link successful completion of an apprenticeship level to an increase in salary or a bonus, so it is worth finding out this information from your employer ahead of time.</p> <p>High school students entering a trade may also be eligible for prizes and scholarships that they can use toward their post-secondary studies. Check with your school to find out what is available.</p> <p>Occasionally, there are also federal and provincial initiatives that support trades training for individuals meeting specific criteria. The trades training department of your local institution can advise you of any initiatives that may currently be available and let you know if you satisfy the eligibility criteria.</p> <h1 id="chapter-30-section-8" class="section-header">Apprentice Interprovincial Mobility</h1> <p>There are apprentice mobility protocols and agreements in place between the provinces that enable apprentices to pursue jobs anywhere in Canada without interruption to their continuum of training.</p> <p>This mobility option was made possible as a result of the Harmonization Initiative launched in 2013 to substantively align apprenticeship systems across Canada by making training requirements more consistent.

The program has been in existence for over 50 years and is administered by each of the designated provincial and territorial apprenticeship authorities under the guidance of the Canadian Council of Directors of Apprenticeship (CCDA). The formal name of this program is the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program.</p> <p>The Red Seal is not a certificate. It is an endorsement that is affixed to a provincial or territorial trades certificate upon successful completion of all provincial requirements and the Red Seal exam. It is available in 57 different trades, and over 625,000 tradespeople in Canada have obtained the Red Seal Endorsement (RSE) to date.

It denotes that an individual has the knowledge and skill sets for accomplishing work in their trade.</p> <p>Once you have received your Red Seal endorsement, you may use the RSE acronym on your résumé, business cards, and promotional information.</p> <h1 id="chapter-32-section-3" class="section-header">Red Seal Exam</h1> <p>The Red Seal exam is administered to determine whether apprentices and experienced tradespeople meet the Canadian Red Seal standards. The examinations are developed for each of the Red Seal trades with the assistance of industry trade experts from across the country and are based on the Red Seal Occupational Standard (RSOS). (More information on the RSOS is provided below.)</p> <p>To qualify to write a Red Seal exam, an individual must have fulfilled all requirements set out by their provincial/territorial apprenticeship authority. The criteria for eligibility to write the exam differ from one trade to another and depend on the type of applicant (e.g., apprentice, trade qualifier/challenger, journeyperson).</p> <p>The Red Seal Endorsement Official Mark on a provincial/territorial trades certificate signifies that you have completed the Canadian recognized standard of competency in your trade. In some cases (e.g., in British Columbia), the Red Seal exam is taken in lieu of a provincial exam in the final level of the apprenticeship training. In other provinces or territories the exam may be taken in addition to other provincial requirements.</p> <p>To receive your Red Seal endorsement, you must achieve a mark of 70% or higher on the Red Seal exam. If you are unsuccessful in passing the exam, you must wait a set period of time before your next attempt. The waiting period is determined by the individual province or territory.</p> <p>Should you be unsuccessful a second time, you will be required to follow a course of study as defined by your jurisdiction (province or territory) prior to any subsequent attempt.</p> <h1 id="chapter-32-section-4" class="section-header">Red Seal Occupational Standard (RSOS)</h1> <p>The first National Conference on Apprenticeship in Trades and Industries, held in Ottawa in 1952, recommended that the federal government be requested to cooperate with provincial and territorial apprenticeship committees and officials in preparing analyses of a number of skilled occupations. The Red Seal Occupational Standard (RSOS) document for each trade is the basis for the Red Seal Program. Every RSOS provides a comprehensive analysis of a trade completed by a committee of industry experts, and is representative of all jurisdictions. The standards have the following objectives:</p> <ul><li>to describe and group the tasks performed by skilled workers;</li> <li>to identify which tasks are performed in every province and territory;</li> <li>to develop instruments for use in the preparation of Interprovincial Red Seal Examinations and assessment tools for apprenticeship and certification authorities;</li> <li>to develop common tools for apprenticeship on-the-job and technical training in Canada;</li> <li>to facilitate the mobility of apprentices and skilled workers in Canada;</li> <li>to supply employers, employees, associations, industries, training institutions and governments with analyses of occupations.</li> </ul> <h2>Structure of the standard</h2> <p>To facilitate understanding of the occupation, the RSOS standards contain the following sections:</p> <ul><li>Description of the trade: An overview of the trade’s duties, work environment, job requirements, similar occupations and career progression</li> <li>Essential Skills Summary: An overview of how each of the 9 essential skills is applied in the trade</li> <li>Trends in the trade: Some of the trends identified by industry as being the most important for workers in the trade</li> <li>Industry Expected Performance: description of the expectations regarding the level of performance of the tasks, including information related to specific codes, regulations and standards that must be observed</li> <li>Language Requirements: description of the language requirements for working and studying in this trade in Canada</li> <li>Pie Chart: a graph which depicts the national percentages of exam questions assigned to the major work activities</li> <li>Task Matrix and Examination Weightings: a chart which outlines graphically the major work activities, tasks and sub-tasks of this standard and their respective exam weightings</li> <li>Major Work Activity (MWA): the largest division within the standard that is comprised of a detailed description of each of the trade tasks and their skills.</li> </ul> <p>At the end of each RSOS is a series of appendices that include:</p> <ul><li>a list of acronyms</li> <li>all of the tools and equipment required for a trade</li> <li>a glossary of terms associated with the trade</li> </ul> <p>The Red Seal Occupational Standard (RSOS) was introduced in 2015, and they replaced the previous National Occupational Analysis (NOA) as each trades standard was updated.</p> <h2>Other RSOS products</h2> <p>The RSOS includes features that support the development of informational, learning, and assessment products that encouraged greater consistency in provincial and territorial apprenticeship programs. Some of the elements that were previously in the NOA have been recreated as separate informational learning or assessment products. Some of these additional products that are available for each trade may include:</p> <ul><li>Trade Profile, a quick snapshot of all trade activities in the standard.</li> <li>Ellis Chart compares apprenticeship programs across all Canadian jurisdictions</li> <li>Curriculum Outline, which organizes the knowledge elements of the RSOS and provides recommendations for training levels.</li> <li>On-the-job Training Guide</li> <li>Essential Skills Outline, the most important essential skills for each sub-task have also been identified</li> <li>Red Seal exam breakdown, provides a list of the number of questions in each task and sub-task</li> <li>Exam sample questions</li> </ul> <div class="textbox shaded"><p><img class="wp-image-18 alignleft" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png" alt="Resources icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_R-e1624808556202-350x350.png 350w" title="" />To view an example of all of the resources available, visit the designated trades web site and select a trade: <a href="https://www.red-seal.ca/eng/trades/tr.1d.2s_l.3st.shtml" data-url="https://www.red-seal.ca/eng/trades/tr.1d.2s_l.3st.shtml">Red Seal Trades</a></p> </div> <div><img class="wp-image-20 alignleft" src="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828.png" alt="Self-test icon." width="30" height="30" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828.png 587w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828-300x300.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828-65x65.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828-225x225.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/tradescommoncoreb4/wp-content/uploads/sites/373/2021/10/noun_tick-e1624808948828-350x350.png 350w" title="" />Now complete the Learning Task Self-Test.</div> <h1 id="chapter-32-section-5" class="section-header">Self Test</h1> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Self-Test 2</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>The Red Seal program is the Canadian standard of excellence for skilled trades in Canada. <ol type="a"><li>True</li> <li>False</li> </ol> </li> <li>The Red Seal program does not set common standards to assess the skills of tradespersons across Canada. <ol type="a"><li>True</li> <li>False</li> </ol> </li> <li>The Red Seal is a certification issued by the Canadian government. <ol type="a"><li>True</li> <li>False</li> </ol> </li> <li>How many Red Seal trades exist to date?

If you are completing your apprenticeship in British Columbia in an applicable trade, upon successful completion of the Red Seal exam you will also receive your Red Seal endorsement (RSE).</p> <p>To take on the role of a journeyperson you may also need further education. This may include individual learning, such as becoming aware of all of the recent changes and trends in the industry and acquiring in-depth knowledge of the apprenticeship’s training program and what needs to be taught in the workplace at each level of the apprenticeship. As a journeyperson, you may also want to acquire additional formal training to become better acquainted with mentoring and coaching of an individual; for example by completing a continuing education course in leadership.</p> <p>As you will have noted from looking at the Red Seal Occupation Standard (RSOS), all trades require some degree of continual learning to keep up with changes in the industry brought on by new technologies (products or tools), changes in code, or new government legislation. In addition, the use of communication technologies continues to grow rapidly and affect the trades. This includes use of smart phone applications, social media, Web applications, and business-related software and hardware, particularly for individuals who are self-employed or own a small trade-related company. Your ability to keep up with these new demands will ensure that you keep competitive in your field.</p> <h1 id="chapter-34-section-1" class="section-header">Role of the Journeyperson in Training</h1> <p>A journeyperson is knowledgeable about all aspects of their trade. One of the roles of the journeyperson is to assist in the work-based training of new apprentices. The assignment of an apprentice to a journeyperson for mentoring or coaching will be the decision of your employer.</p> <p>The size of a company will determine the role a journeyperson will have in training a new apprentice. In large companies, the training of an apprentice may be a team approach, with individuals in the firm taking on different orientation and/or training. In smaller companies, this role may fall largely in the hands of the journeyperson and their supervisor.</p> <p>The duties assigned to a journeyperson may include assistance with or responsibility for:</p> <ul><li>teaching apprentices all aspects of the trade</li> <li>orienting new apprentices to the workplace, including advising on any company policies and procedures that may need to be followed on the job site</li> <li>informing apprentices about the company’s expectations and what they will receive</li> <li>helping apprentices better understand their trade, the tools and equipment they use, and safety standards</li> <li>developing a training plan for the apprentice</li> <li>supervising, mentoring, and/or coaching the apprentice</li> <li>providing constructive feedback in all aspects of the job, including priorities and time management</li> <li>helping apprentices develop strategies to improve in areas where their skills may fall short, and monitoring their progress in these areas</li> <li>providing feedback to the supervisor on the progress of apprentices</li> <li>evaluating apprentices’ roles in the workplace for certification</li> </ul> <h1 id="chapter-34-section-2" class="section-header">Mentorship</h1> <p>Mentorship is an important part of being a journeyperson, as you supervise and train apprentices you also take on the role of mentor in their training journey.&nbsp; Good mentorship is essential to the success of apprentices.&nbsp; Some of the benefits of mentorship are, higher quality of work, reduced workplace injuries, increased productivity, decreased number of mistakes, improved workplace morale, and higher levels of employee satisfaction.&nbsp; If you experience good mentorship in your training, you are more likely to pass that experience along to your future apprentices.&nbsp; Mentorship can exist in many ways in the trades, it can be between a journeyperson and apprentice, between two apprentices of different levels or between two journeypersons of differing levels of experience.&nbsp; Developing good mentorship skills is deeply rooted in effective communication and listening.</p> <h2>Qualities of a good mentor<strong><br /> </strong></h2> <ul><li><strong>Promotes safe work</strong>, this is important, modeling the safe way to do things has a direct impact on reduction in workplace injuries and near misses.</li> <li><strong>High standards for quality are</strong> also important, it shows how important it is to have a sense of pride in your work and that when work is completed it is done to the highest possible standard.</li> <li><strong>Hard working,</strong> this models work ethic to apprentices.</li> <li><strong>Positive attitude,</strong> helps to engage apprentices, promote learning and keep morale high.</li> <li><strong>Enjoys teaching,</strong> one of the most important qualities that a mentor could have, sharing their knowledge and skills with their mentee should be exciting and fun.&nbsp; Allowing the mentee to see that their mentor is passionate about sharing their knowledge helps to keep the mentee engaged in learning.</li> <li><strong>Good leader,</strong> someone who demonstrates calm and composed leadership, can accept feedback and suggestions from others, intervenes when necessary, leads by example, allows others to take initiative, is focused on the goals of the team, praises others for their successes and provides constructive feedback on mistakes.</li> <li><strong>Patient and empathetic,</strong> understanding that sometimes it takes longer to learn a skill and identifying and removing barriers to learning with patience along with empathy for systemic, structural or personal barriers that an apprentice may face is crucial to their mental well-being which correlates directly to their long-term success.</li> <li><strong>Takes the time to</strong> <strong>teach and explain,</strong> even with deadlines and performance targets a mentor who is willing to take time to teach new skills and when necessary review and repeat to reinforce learning is much more likely to have successful learning outcomes with an apprentice than someone who is unwilling to take the necessary time to develop a skill with their mentee.&nbsp; Good communication skills and listening skills are essential to this for a mentor.</li> <li><strong>Targets multiple learning styles,</strong> all people learn in slightly different ways, being able to present information to your mentee in a blend of visual, auditory and hands on will help to find their specific learning style.</li> </ul> <p>A good mentor can have a positive impact on an apprentice’s success, just as a bad mentor can have a negative impact on an apprentice’s success.&nbsp; As a mentee it is important to advocate for good mentorship for yourself during your apprenticeship.&nbsp; This may mean seeking mentorship outside of your workplace or from a different journeyperson at your workplace.&nbsp; A mentoring relationship is two sided and while the mentor generally does the teaching, the mentee must also bring their own set of skills to the table to be effectively mentored.</p> <h2>Qualities of a good mentee</h2> <ul><li><strong>Dedicated to working safely,</strong> a commitment to safety allows others to feel safe in working with you and in your safety.</li> <li><strong>Passionate about the trade,</strong> this is directly connected to job satisfaction, if you don’t enjoy the work you’re doing it is hard to be satisfied.&nbsp; Showing genuine enthusiasm and excitement for the work you do illustrates this passion for your trade.</li> <li><strong>Strong desire to learn,</strong> showing interest and initiative in learning new skills shows your mentor that you are committed to learning and growth.</li> <li><strong>Good communication skills,</strong> knowing how to communicate and listen effectively goes a long way in ensuring that you get the most out of your mentorship.&nbsp; Other important communication skills include, problem solving, conflict resolution and engaging in respectful communication.</li> <li><strong>Asks questions frequently,</strong> this is crucial, if you do not know something or need clarification you must be confident enough to ask your mentor.&nbsp; Asking questions should be encouraged by a good mentor, it allows the mentee to feel knowledgeable and confident in the skills they are acquiring and prevents unnecessary mistakes from occurring.</li> <li><strong>Requests feedback, it’s</strong> as simple as asking “How did I do?”&nbsp; This allows the mentee to have an ongoing assessment of their progress and helps to identify areas that may need improvement.</li> <li><strong>Values constructive criticism</strong> and views it as a learning opportunity, it’s not personal when a mentor provides constructive criticism of work, the mentor’s goal is to help the continued development of the mentee’s skills and this involves honest critique of work done.&nbsp; As a mentee constructive criticism should be viewed as a way to continue to improve and grow skill sets in areas that the mentor may identify need additional work.</li> </ul> <p>Remember, mentorships are a two-way street, they require respectful communication, good listening skills, a desire to teach and be taught and a good fit between mentor and mentee.&nbsp; The basis of the apprenticeship system is founded on the idea of skills taught by mentorship.&nbsp; Think about it this way, as an apprentice, 95% or more of your training will occur on the job.&nbsp; The most significant amount of skills and training you will acquire will be from your mentors, and as a journeyperson you will bestow your knowledge and skills upon your future mentees.&nbsp; This is how information has been passed down for centuries and is important for ensuring knowledge is not lost between generations.</p> <h1 id="chapter-34-section-3" class="section-header">Other Opportunities</h1> <p>As a journeyperson, you will be exposed to many different opportunities that you can pursue related to your trade and career path. The following are just a few that you may wish to explore further:</p> <ul><li>Many journeypersons hold multiple trade credentials and additional certifications. This allows them to perform multiple functions on job sites and increases their marketability. For example, a metal fabricator may hold a welding ticket, allowing for more versatility.</li> <li>Some journeypersons use their credentials to travel and find work in other Canadian provinces or internationally. They may do so by looking for opportunities through employment agencies or by joining large international organizations where travel is one of the expectations of the job.</li> <li>Some journeypersons work as subject matter experts for industry, associations, and unions, including working in the role of safety inspectors.</li> <li>Many journeypersons pursue supervisory or management positions. In order to do so they may need to take formal education in areas related to administration or business.</li> <li>Many journeypersons are entrepreneurial and start their own small businesses.</li> <li>Some journeypersons take on positions related to trades training at public or private institutions. Doing this requires pursuing the appropriate qualifications (see below).</li> </ul> <p>All of the opportunities listed above may necessitate acquiring additional information or formal training.

We have described the supports, initiatives, and opportunities available for trades training, the process of registering for an apprenticeship in BC, the roles and responsibilities of all parties in the apprenticeship system, and the financial supports available for training. We have also provided an overview of the Canadian Red Seal program, including information on Red Seal exams and how to find the National Occupational Analysis for different trades. We have also looked at the path to becoming a Journeyperson, exploring the role of Journeypeople, mentorship, and other opportunities that are available once you have obtained your Red Seal.</p> <p>After completing the Learning Tasks in this Competency, you will understand that the apprenticeship process is designed to prepare you for becoming a Red Seal tradesperson and relies on a number of different groups and individuals to help you achieve success, this can include your employer and Journeyperson, the provincial training authority, community organizations, training institutions and of course you. As an apprentice in a skilled trade, you will be aware of the requirements to achieve your Red Seal and its importance along with what skills and areas you need to focus on to meet these criteria. Once you achieve your Red Seal you will understand the role you play as a Journeyperson both as an employee and as a mentor for other apprentices, and what opportunities there are for further advancement or other career opportunities connected to your trade.</p> <h3>Media Attributions</h3> <ul><li>“<a href="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_quxwt84o" data-url="https://media.bccampus.ca/media/0_quxwt84o">Line B-4: Summary</a>” audio recording was generated using NaturalReader Commercial by BCcampus and is licensed under a <a class="internal" href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY 4.0 licence</a>.</li> </ul> </div></div>
