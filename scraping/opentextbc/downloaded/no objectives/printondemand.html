Prior to the digital age, most information was available in books that were printed by publishers in large (and expensive) allotments using offset printing.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="494-1"></span></span> The idea of requesting — and printing — a single copy of a book was unheard of.</p> <p>The PoD model began in the 1990s as digital press technology — as well as printing and binding methods — developed and improved, allowing publishers to retreat from printing large runs of books and then dealing with unsold copies.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="494-2"></span></span> Replacing the standard large-book-inventory method with on-demand book printing afforded publishers other savings, too, including a reduction in storage costs, less labour needed for handling inventory, and lower inventory management fees. In 2008, UBC Press — Canada’s third largest university press<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="494-3"></span></span> — began using the print-on-demand and short-run digital printing models as part of its workflow to keep book inventory at workable levels.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="494-4"></span></span></p> <p>While the price of each print-on-demand copy is typically higher than those produced with offset printing, the average PoD cost <em>is</em> lower for small print runs because setup costs for digital printing — including technical configuration — are much lower than those for offset printing. This advantage not only reduces the publisher’s risks, but also leads to more choices for the consumer, such as the ability to order a discrete, professionally produced book. Still, less publisher liability can also mean lower quality control of the printed book.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="494-5"></span></span></p> <p>Nevertheless, the PoD model aligns well with open textbooks. For instructors who take full advantage of the open-copyright licence (the tool that makes a textbook <em>open</em>) by customizing the book to suit their teaching methods and curricula; updating it regularly to keep the material current; and/or inviting students to contribute to the book as part of a course assignment (in line with open pedagogical practice), printing textbooks on demand is the ideal way to go.</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> <div class="footnotes"><div id='494-1'>“Offset Printing,” Wikipedia, last modified April 17, 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Offset_printing.</div><div id='494-2'>Edmund Chamberlain, “Investigating Faster Techniques for Digitization and Print-on-Demand,” <em>New Review of Academic Librarianship</em> 18, no. 1 (2012): 64, https://doi.org/10.1080/13614533.2012.660769.</div><div id='494-3'>“About UBC Press,” About Us, UBC Press, accessed April 8, 2020, http://www.ubcpress.ca/about-us.</div><div id='494-4'>Sara Xue Ying Chang, “A Case Study of Print on Demand and Short-Run Digital Printing at the University of British Columbia Press” (master's project report, Simon Fraser University, 2017), https://summit.sfu.ca/item/17530.</div><div id='494-5'>“Print on Demand,” Wikipedia, last modified April 26, 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Print_on_demand.</div></div></div></div>

Many individuals remain confused about copyright law and are hesitant to print anything, afraid they might be committing copyright fraud. Martin Warkentin, Copyright Librarian at the University of the Fraser Valley in Abbotsford, B.C., says, “Many folks I deal with who are conscientious about copyright are wary about physical printing — the (wrong) gut instinct seems to be printing a substantial part of anything is akin to infringement.”</p> <p>The open-copyright licence is not the only device designed to make copyrighted educational materials easier to use and print: another is <a href="https://fair-dealing.ca/what-is-fair-dealing/" data-url="https://fair-dealing.ca/what-is-fair-dealing/">fair dealing</a>. This copyright exception, added to the <a href="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/" data-url="https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-42/">Canadian Copyright Act</a> in 1921, allows the use and printing of copyrighted works for educational purposes without permission as long as certain parameters are followed.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="65-1"></span></span> Like copyright in general, fair dealing and how it impacts the printing of course materials is covered in many university and college handbooks. At the University of British Columbia (UBC), for example, their “Copyright Guidelines for UBC Faculty, Staff and Students” includes a section entitled <a href="https://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-guidelines/#fair-dealing" data-url="https://copyright.ubc.ca/copyright-guidelines/#fair-dealing">Is copying of the work permitted under the <em>Copyright Act</em>? The Fair Dealing Exception</a>. Adding openly licensed resources to the what-can-I-print discussion can further muddy the waters.</p> <p>Christina Hendricks, Academic Director for the Centre for Teaching, Learning and Technology at UBC, says, “There has been a lot of conversation at my institution over the past few years about ensuring one follows copyright rules when photocopying works, or making print copies of works and distributing them to students. Faculty might be worried that they could run afoul of copyright rules when reusing open educational resources if they don’t have enough knowledge about how open licences work.”</p> <h1 id="coursepack">The course pack precedent</h1> <p>The commonly used course pack is a study in how copyright can affect the printing of teaching materials. Examining the course pack’s history provides the context within which educators have operated for the past several decades in order to provide their students with the best learning resources possible.</p> <p>Course packs are “printed collections of readings assembled by teachers to supplement college and university courses.”<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="65-2"></span></span> The practice of collecting handouts in one packet for a course as supplementary materials or to replace a textbook began in earnest in the 1980s and ’90s, when photocopying became easy. However, it is the fair dealing provision in Canada’s copyright law — followed by landmark decisions by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2004 and 2012 — that confirmed course packs are permitted and showed how they should be assembled under copyright law.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="65-3"></span></span></p> <p>Since then, instructors who use course packs and the librarians and staff who compile them have been careful during the copyright review phase of course pack creation, a step that requires time and money.</p> <p>The cost to produce a course pack at UBC through its bookstore, for example, varies depending not only on the number of pages in each packet and the quantity printed, but also on permission fees charged by copyright holders to use content that is beyond the scope of fair dealing or not covered by an institution’s <a href="https://www.accesscopyright.ca/" data-url="https://www.accesscopyright.ca/">Access Copyright</a> licence.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="65-4"></span></span></p> <p>The University of Victoria (UVic) requires that course pack orders be submitted two months prior to a course’s start date in order to conduct a complete copyright review, including receiving copyright permissions. Copyright permissions for course packs are typically granted for one academic term. This window of permission for a select classroom audience may result in the course pack being prohibited from inclusion in its institution’s course reserve, as is the case at UVic.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="65-5"></span></span></p> <p>More recently, some institutions are asking faculty to consider not only copyrighted materials, but also those in the public domain as well as open educational resources when compiling course packs as a way to save time and money. For an example of institutional recommendations, see <a href="https://camosun.ca.libguides.com/c.php?g=92245&amp;p=597589" data-url="https://camosun.ca.libguides.com/c.php?g=92245&amp;p=597589">Copyright guide for Camosun College: Coursepacks</a>.</p> <h1 id="printing">Printing open textbooks</h1> <p>Anyone, anywhere may print and distribute an unlimited number of copies of a textbook released with an open-copyright — or open — licence without asking the copyright holder for permission. These openly licensed books are called <em>open textbooks</em>. Unfortunately, says Brendan Hunter, Course Materials Supervisor for the Langara Bookstore in Vancouver, “most people have no idea what the boundaries of open (i.e., open-copyright licences) are.”</p> <h2 id="openlicences">Open-copyright licences</h2> <p>Many, if not most, open textbooks are copyrighted. Copyright refers to the legal rights held by the copyright owner of a creative work who is often (but not always) the creator of the material. Typically, copyright holders choose to retain all their rights. What makes an open textbook different from a closed textbook is that, with the former, the copyright holder has released their work with an open-copyright licence. A licence is a contract or agreement by which the copyright holder gives permission to another entity or individual to copy and disseminate their work.</p> <p>The open licences used most often with educational materials are <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> (CC) licences. Like other copyright licences, CC licences are legal tools. A CC licence gives the copyright holder the ability to provide advanced permission to everyone to use their work. There is no limit to how many times the permissions afforded by a CC licensed work may be used, and these permissions have no expiration date. The only condition imposed when using an open work is that the user must attribute, or give credit to, the author.</p> <div class="textbox shaded"><p style="text-align: center;">For more information, see <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/copyright-and-open-licenses/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/copyright-and-open-licenses/">Copyright and Open Licences</a> and <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/concerns-about-plagiarism/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/concerns-about-plagiarism/">Concerns About Plagiarism</a> in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em>.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">For how to write an <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-captions-attributions/#attributions" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-captions-attributions/#attributions">attribution statement</a>, see “Attributions” in the Resources: Captions and Attributions chapter of the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em>.</p> <p style="text-align: center;">For details on how open textbook authors can provide copyright information, and examples of an attribution statement and citation for licensees and readers, see <a href="http://opentextbc.ca/pressbooks/chapter/book-info-page/#copyrightstatement" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/pressbooks/chapter/book-info-page/#copyrightstatement">this copyright statement example</a> in the Book Info Page chapter of the <em>Pressbooks Guide</em>.</p> </div> <h2 id="publicdomain">Public domain</h2> <p>When copyright does <em>not</em> apply to a work because copyright has expired or the author has waived their <em>copy rights</em>, then that work is considered to be in the public domain. This means that anyone and everyone — i.e., the public — can use this work in any way they wish. Examples of creative works in the public domain are Shakespeare’s plays, Mary Shelley’s <em>Frankenstein</em>, and Beethoven’s compositions.</p> <p>Students, instructors, and others are free to print and make multiple copies of textbooks in the public domain. Without copyright in place, public domain resources are without legal restrictions or ownership and thus are bound by fewer conditions than textbooks covered by an open licence. It can be said that:</p> <ul><li>Copyrighted textbooks without an open licence have <em>all rights reserved</em></li> <li>Openly licensed textbooks have <em>some rights reserved</em></li> <li>Textbooks in the public domain have <em>no rights reserved</em></li> </ul> <p>Unfortunately, it isn’t always clear if a resource is in the public domain, though <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/">public domain tools</a> do exist for marking these works. Therefore, it is up to the individual to ensure that a textbook or educational resource is without copyright before printing it. Searching in <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-search-find/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-search-find/">repositories known to hold public domain resources</a> is a good place to start. And even though giving credit to the author of a work in the public domain is not legally required, doing so is considered good academic practice.</p> <div class="textbox shaded" style="text-align: center;">For more information, see <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/back-matter/appendix-1/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/back-matter/appendix-1/">Licences and Tools</a> in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em>.</div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> <div class="footnotes"><div id='65-1'>“Fair Dealing in Canadian Copyright Law,” Wikipedia, last modified May 11, 2020, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_dealing_in_Canadian_copyright_law.</div><div id='65-2'>“Coursepacks,” Wikipedia, last modified August 13, 2017, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coursepacks.</div><div id='65-3'>Council of Ministers of Education, Canada, <em>Fair Dealing Guidelines</em> (poster, CMEC website, July 31, 2019), https://cmec.ca/docs/copyright/CMEC_POSTER_FDG_EN.pdf.</div><div id='65-4'>“Faculty FAQ: Classroom, 2.1 What Are the Copyright Rules that Apply to My Teaching?,” Copyright at UBC, University of British Columbia, accessed April 23, 2020, https://copyright.ubc.ca/instructor-faq/#2.1_What_are_the_copyright_rules_that_apply_to_my_teaching?.</div><div id='65-5'>“Coursepacks,” UVic Bookstore, University of Victoria, accessed April 23, 2020, https://www.uvicbookstore.ca/text/coursepacks.</div></div></div></div>

Anecdotally, reasons for this range from personal preference to memories of being read to as a child. Some feel it’s easier to make notes when reading a physical book. Others are uncomfortable reading online or using technology. Still others like the flexibility of having a textbook that’s available both online <em>and</em> in hard copy. Hearsay aside, research supports the fact that not everyone’s first choice is digital.</p> <h1>Some professors prefer print</h1> <p>According to a print-on-demand survey, instructors expressed an array of preferences when it came to their teaching materials, be they print, digital, or a combination of both.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="400-1"></span></span> These personal tastes are reflected in other research, too.</p> <p>A survey of faculty conducted by the National Association of College Stores during the 2016–17 academic year found that half the instructors surveyed preferred a print textbook over a digital one. One-fifth said they liked to have both print and online components available, while 7 per cent favoured an exclusively digital format for teaching.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="400-2"></span></span></p> <h1>Some students prefer print</h1> <p>Even in this technological age, there are students who want to learn from an old-fashioned printed textbook. Some college bookstores in British Columbia report there are students who still lean toward printed textbooks for courses. Jodie Pickering, kinesiology instructor at the College of the Rockies in Cranbrook, B.C., reports that many of her students “like to have a paper copy to highlight and make notes in. Plus they like to be able to bring their textbook into the lab.”<em><br /> </em></p> <p>Research conducted at Adams State University, a small Hispanic-serving institution in rural Colorado, explored what format students prefer for their textbooks: print or digital. The resounding choice was print, at almost 80 per cent.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="400-3"></span></span></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_1142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1142" style="width: 500px"><a class="internal" href="https://opentextbc.ca/printondemand/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2020/06/Media-Preference.png" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/printondemand/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2020/06/Media-Preference.png"><img class="wp-image-1142" src="https://opentextbc.ca/printondemand/wp-content/uploads/sites/160/2020/06/Media-Preference.png" alt="Graph about media preference.

According to Gagné and Glaser, how <em>well</em> a student learns depends on several factors, such as working memory and academic ability.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-1"></span></span> Learning by reading the printed or digital page taps into even more competencies, including vocabulary, prior subject knowledge, and the speed — and comprehension level — at which one reads.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-2"></span></span> <span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-3"></span></span></p> <p>Some research suggests that choosing to read digital versus physical text can sacrifice a student’s depth of knowledge because of practices characteristic when using a screen: faster reading and extensive scrolling.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-4"></span></span> <span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-5"></span></span> Adding these effects to the learning challenges experienced by certain students makes the printed page a better choice — or even a necessity — for some.</p> <h1 id="learnstyle">Learning style</h1> <p>Many faculty and staff have observed that content format influences how well some of their students learn. Jennifer Kirkey, Chair of the Physics Department at Douglas College in British Columbia, says that she has “a small, but significant, number of students for whom print is essential due to problems with reading on the screen.”</p> <p>Jennifer Stacey, Course Materials Manager for the University of British Columbia Bookstore, points out that learning differences mean that various formats should be made available for students in order to increase accessibility, comprehension, and success.</p> <p>“Students should be able to access materials that support needs or preferences for how they best learn,” she says, “and, for some students, that means having a print option available.”</p> <h1 id="learnenglish">Learning English</h1> <h2 id="abe">Adult Basic Education</h2> <p>Shantel Ivits, Department Head of Basic Education at Vancouver Community College, says that having textbooks available in print ensures a level playing field for students who do not own the technology or possess the computer literacy skills to access textbooks online.</p> <p>“For adult literacy learners who are already working hard to learn to decode text,” explains Ivits, “the online interface adds an extra layer of intimidation and challenge. Printed texts remove this barrier and help make literacy learning a more comfortable experience.”</p> <div class="textbox shaded" style="text-align: center;">See the <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/browse-our-collection/find-open-textbooks/?subject=Adult%20Basic%20Education" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/browse-our-collection/find-open-textbooks/?subject=Adult%20Basic%20Education">Adult Basic Education</a> section of the B.C. Open Textbook Collection.</div> <h2 id="ell">English language learning and foreign language learning</h2> <p>Learning another language is difficult for most people. In English-speaking countries, like Canada and the United States, we refer to these programs as ELL (English language learning), ESL (English as a second language), and EFL (English as a foreign language). A broader term given to language learning is FLL (foreign language learning). Regardless of the label, the form in which these learning materials are provided can affect the road to fluency.</p> <p>At the Acsenda School of Management in Vancouver, where over 80 per cent of students come from outside Canada, Ali de Haan, Manager of Library and Instructional Services, says that many international students report feeling more comfortable with a printed book.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-6"></span></span></p> <p>“A common bit of feedback I’ve heard,” says Ali, “is that it is easier to understand English in print, and they feel like they can take their time with it. Also, I think there is a comfort factor with print, as many of them haven’t used an eBook in their studies before.” <em><br /> </em></p> <p>This approach can also be applied to students who are native English speakers and learning a foreign language, such as French or Mandarin. In a 2019 paper from Indonesia, Pardede reviewed literature on reading comprehension among ELL students who were using digital text. He reported that, compared to the printed page, online reading requires a complex set of strategies, such as scrolling, navigating, decision making, and visual processing. These demands may result in lower comprehension scores for some students.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-7"></span></span></p> <h1 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h1> <p>Finally, for some students, online resources present accessibility problems. Susan Fleming, Educational Technologist at College of the Rockies in Cranbrook, B.C., says she has worked with students who have difficulty reading from a screen for more than a couple of minutes due to visual impairments, visual processing problems (e.g., dyslexia), and visual focusing issues. More specific conditions that can cause problems, says Fleming, include <a href="https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/" data-url="https://irlen.com/what-is-irlen-syndrome/">Meares-Irlen Syndrome</a>, which can result in chronic dizziness that can trigger psychiatric issues, and <a href="https://opto.ca/health-library/computer-vision-syndrome-digital-eye-strain" data-url="https://opto.ca/health-library/computer-vision-syndrome-digital-eye-strain">Computer Vision Syndrome</a>.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="402-8"></span></span></p> <div class="textbox shaded" style="text-align: center;">For more information, see the <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/"><em>Accessibility Toolkit – 2nd Edition</em></a>.</div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> <div class="footnotes"><div id='402-1'>Robert M.

The B.C. provincial government reports that, while 93 per cent of its urban households have internet access at the <a href="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm" data-url="https://crtc.gc.ca/eng/home-accueil.htm">Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission</a> (CRTC) target speeds of 50/10 Mbps,<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="404-1"></span></span> approximately two-thirds of its rural and Indigenous communities do not.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="404-2"></span></span></p> <p>For post-secondary institutions in remote regions, pulling up an online open textbook can be difficult or impossible. For these situations, a printed textbook is needed. Jason Wallace, Purchasing Manager for Print and Retail Services at North Island College in Comox, B.C., concurs, stating, “Not all students have access to high-speed internet and computers. We have students and programs in very remote communities, and online-only is not a viable option.”</p> <p>The reasons for poor connectivity within a community, on campus, or for an individual or family are many, as listed on <a href="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc/connected-communities/success-factors" data-url="https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc/connected-communities/success-factors">Connected Communities: Success Factors</a>. Connected Communities, an initiative of the B.C. Ministry of Citizens’ Services, was designed to “support the digital readiness of local governments, First Nations and rural communities.”<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="404-3"></span></span></p> <p>The five success factors on the Connected Communities list are leadership and support, connectivity, digital capability, sustainability, and community well-being. From these can be drawn three general areas that need attention by regions looking to upgrade internet service. These are:</p> <ol><li>Leadership’s willingness and ability to collaborate with the internet service provider <em>and</em> strategically plan and implement steps to install (and maintain) online services</li> <li>Assurance that internet service will not only be affordable for the community, but provide adequate bandwidth and speed for students learning online and individuals working online</li> <li>A pledge that affordable training is made available for users with little or no computer and/or internet skills</li> </ol> <p>Carolee Clyne, BCcampus’ Open Education Advisor for Northern B.C., sums up the issue this way:</p> <blockquote><p>“Challenges with internet in the rural areas can be linked to distance from major urban centres. The farther away and the smaller the population, the less likely there is consistent access. Both cellphone service and wired internet services are limited. For many residents, the cost to have the services is more than they can afford, so they do without. Often, the computer literacy is limited, given this scarcity of access. In many communities, a key community centre will have access, and this would be the only place for access in these areas. People using the centre will also have limited opportunity to explore online for a couple of reasons: the quality of the connection is often poor and low bandwidth, so response times are slow, and this resource is shared with the community, so times are limited.”</p></blockquote> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> <div class="footnotes"><div id='404-1'>50 Mbps for downloads and 10 Mbps for uploads.</div><div id='404-2'>“Connectivity in B.C.,” Province of British Columbia, accessed April 24, 2020, https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc.</div><div id='404-3'>“Connected Communities: Success Factors,” Province of British Columbia, accessed April 24, 2020, https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/governments/connectivity-in-bc/connected-communities.</div></div></div></div>

Providing this same service at a student’s college or university offers two advantages over a service that is far away: it’s faster and cheaper. Martin Warkentin, Copyright Librarian at the University of the Fraser Valley, points out that savings include more than time and money.</p> <p>“From a sustainability perspective,” says Martin, “it makes sense for printing to occur locally with minimal transportation requirements … (and to avoid) unnecessary generation of more packaging and fuel consumption.”</p> <p>It’s faster because the purchaser doesn’t need to wait for an off-campus service to process the order, then print, bind, and ship the book. It has been observed, for example, that B.C. students and faculty ordering from the <a href="https://opentextbook.docsol.sfu.ca/store/shop/" data-url="https://opentextbook.docsol.sfu.ca/store/shop/">B.C. Open Textbook Collection store</a> receive shipments sooner than customers in eastern Canada and across the border in the United States.</p> <p>A campus-based print-on-demand service is cheaper because shipping is not part of the cost. Of course, the pricing structure for printed open textbooks and educational resources varies between institutions. A common topic among individuals interested in print on demand for OER is how to offer students an affordable printed alternative to traditional commercial textbooks.</p> <p>Jason Wallace, Purchasing Manager for Print and Retail Services at North Island College, points out some of the problems observed on his campus among students seeking printed books.</p> <p>“We have many students,” says Jason, “including remote students, with limited or no access to internet and electronic devices who find it unaffordable to photocopy materials through some place like Staples; others don’t even have access to a copy shop. Some people have trouble reading from screens. Some people don’t have a credit card to order a book online. So being able to go to their campus store and get what they need, often through funding — which they can’t use online — is not only convenient, but sometimes essential.”</p> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> </div></div>

He says that these values are important to an institution’s viability because they create “stability and continuity” for its members.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="338-1"></span></span> These shared values and experiences, as well as familiarity with institutional practices and policies, create a bond between individual members of a post-secondary community.</p> <p>Each post-secondary institution can come up with a list of ways that a campus-based printing service might access and incorporate its traditions and values. Here are some ideas:</p> <ol><li><strong>Showcase</strong>. Display printed open textbooks in the campus bookstore window to expand awareness.</li> <li><strong>Normalize</strong>. Place open textbooks on bookstore shelves alongside other printed resources, such as commercial textbooks and course packs, to standardize open textbook use.</li> <li><strong>Brand</strong>. Kwantlen Polytechnic University includes the KPU logo on the covers of open textbooks, such as <a href="https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/internationalstudents/" data-url="https://kpu.pressbooks.pub/internationalstudents/"><em>Getting to Know Your International Students</em></a>.</li> <li><strong>Educate</strong>. Ask the campus copyright officer to compose a statement about open licences that can be added to open textbooks.</li> <li><strong>Celebrate</strong>. Highlight open textbooks revised by the institution’s instructors. For example, Thompson Rivers University published an article when Renée Anderson adapted&nbsp;<a href="https://opentextbc.ca/clinicalskills/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/clinicalskills/"><em>Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care</em></a> to create <a href="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/clinicalproceduresforsaferpatientcaretrubscn/" data-url="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/clinicalproceduresforsaferpatientcaretrubscn/"><em>Clinical Procedures for Safer Patient Care – Thompson Rivers University Edition</em></a>.

Long term, the instructor might also consider how best and how often to make legally permitted changes to an assigned open textbook.</p> <p>The convenience of an on-campus service that is willing and able to print open textbooks on demand benefits faculty in several ways:</p> <ol><li><strong>Convenience</strong>. On-campus services are nearby.</li> <li><strong>Familiarity</strong>. Instructors are acquainted with their institutions’ bookstores and printshop ordering procedures.</li> <li><strong>Special orders</strong>.

Its staff not only print open textbooks, but possess the skills to handle equipment and technology, know the process to complete jobs, and are familiar with its institution’s courses and programs, as well as the needs of its faculty and students (see <a class="internal" href="#chapter-familiarity-values" data-url="/printondemand/chapter/familiarity-values/">Familiarity and Values</a>).</p> <p>The on-site printshop also offers flexibility and convenience at a reasonable price (see <a class="internal" href="#chapter-control-flexibility" data-url="/printondemand/chapter/control-flexibility/">Control and Flexibility</a> and <a class="internal" href="#chapter-faster-cheaper" data-url="/printondemand/chapter/faster-cheaper/">Faster and Cheaper</a>). For example, a faculty member who has revised an open textbook that they don’t plan to share with the global community can still have their course-specific version printed for their students at a reasonable cost, which is something that may not be possible through a publisher specializing in instructor-customized textbooks. Students, looking to print a select number of pages or chapters for personal use, are also well served.</p> <p>A nearby printshop is not only handy, but allows individuals to ask questions directly of its staff, thus making complex orders less daunting. A book with many images, for example, might require special attention to colour printing and the expertise of a printshop staffer. Staff may determine that a book slated for heavy use requires a more sturdy construction than the typical printed book, such as with a book that a student plans to use for several courses or terms or an order for the library course reserve.</p> <p>Each printshop will have its own operational procedures and capacity, which may depend on the number of staff and available equipment. For those contemplating the addition of an open textbook print-on-demand service, below are <a class="internal" href="#printconsider" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/printondemand/chapter/printshop/#printconsider">items to consider</a> during setup.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><strong id="printconsider">Printshop considerations</strong></p> <ul><li>Are there limitations to what can be offered? For example, can one copy be ordered, or is there a minimum number?</li> <li>What will the turnaround time be? Will it vary depending on the number of pages, customizations, and type of binding?</li> <li>Can a portion of an open textbook be printed? What information must the student or instructor provide for these customized orders?</li> <li>How much will each book cost? How will the price be calculated? Per page?

A procedure is in place to add this information to student book lists and the course registration website, according to Jennifer Stacey, Course Materials Manager.

Students pay for these books in the bookstore or online and can pick up their order 24–48 hours later, using the rain check procedure. Books are available in loose-leaf format.</p> <h2>Douglas College</h2> <p>At the Douglas College Bookstore, the Open Education Resource Assistance section of the Douglas College faculty intranet provides this guidance to instructors:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Douglas College Bookstore is committed to the accessibility and affordability of course materials. In addition to digital initiatives and involvement with national associations that enable us to find lower cost alternatives, we also actively support the Open Educational Resource movement. If OER materials are adopted, students who wish to print the material may quickly use their allotment of free printing. If you would like the OER materials available for students to have in printed form, the Bookstore can, dependent upon the rights associated with the material, reproduce the materials into a physical Coursepack. The Coursepack could be listed as optional for the course and be available for sale at the Bookstore in a double sided format. To begin this process, please contact the Coursepack &amp; Copyright Coordinator. If the OER materials are available in printed format direct from OpenStax, the materials can be purchased by the store for sale as an optional item for the course. As OERs continue to evolve, so will the Bookstore, but here are a few things that we are doing right now to assist with this initiative:</em></p> <ul><li><em>We include listings of required OERs on our Booklist so students can see all required course materials “at-a-glance” (on their personalized booklist).</em></li> <li><em>The Bookstore can provide inexpensive print-on-demand options for students who prefer to study and make notes in traditional print form.</em></li> <li><em>The Bookstore collaborates with faculty members and educational departments to ensure that OER communication and delivery is optimized.</em></li> <li><em>The Bookstore is dedicated to keeping up-to date on new trends in OERs to ensure we are able to adjust and add services that will improve the student experience on our campus.​</em></li> </ul> </blockquote> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">The Bookstore–Library Partnership</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>Many post-secondary bookstores have strong relationships with their campus’s libraries, particularly when it comes to how each department can support the usage and availability of open educational resources in both digital and printed formats.</p> <p>Inba Kehoe, Copyright Officer, Scholarly Communication &amp; Research Repository Librarian at the University of Victoria, says this about the situation at her institution:</p> <blockquote><p>The UVic Bookstore has been a great partner with UVic Libraries for quite a long time, and I am particularly grateful for their open and collegial partnership. We meet with the bookstore manager and the course materials manager on a monthly basis and cover issues related to copyright, library open access monograph publishing, OER textbook print on demand, future badging in the textbook catalogue, transitioning faculty away from print course packs to licensed electronic resources, etc. The UVic Bookstore’s primary goal is to help the students wherever they can, and staff have worked collaboratively with us on open access and education initiatives that would help lower the costs of course materials. I believe that we have the longest and strongest library–bookstore partnership in Canada.</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div class="media-attributions clear"><h3>Media Attributions</h3><ul><li><a rel="cc:attributionURL" href="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/photos/acorn-oak-brown-seeds-couple-two-1017796/">Acorn Oak Brown</a> © <a rel="dc:creator" href="https://pixabay.com/service/license/" data-url="https://pixabay.com/service/license/">svklimkin is used under a Pixabay License and is</a> adapted by Lauri Aesoph </li></ul></div> <div class="footnotes"><div id='353-1'>Rosanna Tamburri, “University Bookstores Change with the Times,” <em>University Affairs</em>, April 8, 2015, https://www.universityaffairs.ca/news/news-article/university-bookstores-change-with-the-times/.</div></div></div></div>

In addition to Langara College, other examples are listed below.</p> <h2>Douglas College</h2> <p>Debra Flewelling, Open Education &amp; Emerging Technologies Librarian at Douglas College, says that, in the past, her department would buy bound copies of select open textbooks so faculty could assess them as they considered adopting an open educational resource. If an instructor chose to use an open textbook, a printed copy was placed in the library’s course reserve.</p> <p>“What’s changing our practice these days,” adds Flewelling, “is that some of our faculty have moved beyond adoption to adaptation. We’re now experimenting with printing and Cerlox-binding textbooks in our printshop in order to include open textbooks in our course reserves.”</p> <h2>University of British Columbia (UBC)</h2> <p>The UBC Library houses several <a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/" data-url="https://open.library.ubc.ca/">Open Collections</a>, including UBC publications and theses and dissertations by its students. <a href="https://circle.ubc.ca/" data-url="https://circle.ubc.ca/">cIRcle</a>, UBC’s open access digital repository, contains published and unpublished materials authored by UBC staff, faculty, students, and its partners and the surrounding community.</p> <div class="textbox interactive-content interactive-content--oembed"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-1ZAuLrWkIE/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Thumbnail for the embedded element &amp;quot;Open Access at UBC Library&amp;quot;" title="Open Access at UBC Library" /> <p>A YouTube element has been excluded from this version of the text.

Instead, it allows each faculty member to decide whether their adopted textbooks should be placed there.</p> <p>“We also leave it up to the student whether they would like to use the online or print copy of a required open textbook,” says Caroline Daniels, Librarian at KPU. “We have made print-on-demand (PoD) services available in a number of ways in hopes of accommodating all the different scenarios that may arise. While faculty can make arrangements in advance with the KPU bookstore to make printed books available to students within their courses, the library can also help students obtain print copies of open textbooks for any of their courses for the price of printing.”</p> <p>This is done, explains Daniels, either through KPU’s print services or, for books in the B.C.

<div class="back-matter miscellaneous" id="back-matter-appendix-a" title="Textbook Cover Toolkit"><div class="back-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="back-matter-number">1</h3><h1 class="back-matter-title">Appendix A: Open Textbook Cover Toolkit</h1></div><div class="ugc back-matter-ugc"> <p>This toolkit can be used by printshops, providing print-on-demand services, for textbooks missing a cover or in cases when a different cover is needed. Authors and publishers are also welcome to use the toolkit.</p> <p>All images used to create the templates in this toolkit are either covered by a <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution International Licence</a> or are in the public domain.</p> <h1>Book cover elements</h1> <p>This book cover toolkit allows for the essential items of a book cover to be added (title, author) as well as other optional items such as photos or other graphic types, a tag line, and logo. There are three book cover styles to choose from — simple, graphic, photo — each with a template file that can be copied as is or customized.</p> <h2>Template Files</h2> <p>There are two types of files:</p> <ul><li>Visual Guide (PDF)</li> <li>InDesign Template</li> </ul> <h2>Visual Guide</h2> <p>The Visual Guide will help you see the elements of the book cover so you can copy their styles, size and placement. If you do not own or have access to Adobe InDesign, then you may use another program that you are comfortable with.</p> <p><em><strong>Please note:</strong> Whichever program you use, you will need to export your cover to a JPEG image file to upload into Pressbooks to make the cover. Microsoft Word does not export with a high enough resolution to be usable. </em></p> <h2>InDesign template</h2> <p>InDesign is a layout program created by Adobe. If you own the program or have access to it, you can download the template and edit it with your book’s information. You can also modify the template to personalize your book by changing the fonts and colours used. If you have selected the photo or graphic template then you can modify those elements as well to suit your book. If you are not an InDesign user, but have hired a designer to create your book cover, you may pass the template onto them to modify.</p> <h2>Book cover styles</h2> <p>There are three book cover styles to choose from:</p> <ol><li>Simple: colour cover and text</li> <li>Graphic: pattern background and text</li> <li>Photo: image and/or pattern background and text</li> </ol> <p>Each book cover template has a screen or print version. The print version includes a spine and back cover. This is not required for screen viewing.</p> <h2>Book cover final files</h2> <p>When exporting your finished cover choose:</p> <ul><li>PDF for print files</li> <li>JPEG for screen files</li> </ul> <h2>Resources</h2> <p>If you decide to use the graphic or photo cover template, you can find a <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-search-find/" rel="noopener" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-search-find/">list of openly licensed and public domain graphics (vectors) and images</a> in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em>.</p> <h2>Images</h2> <p>When choosing an image for your work, you need to decide if you will be using it for print or for screen. Images for print require a larger resolution than images for screen.</p> <p>See <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/textbook-cover/" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/textbook-cover/">Textbook Cover in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em></a> for details on choosing an image.</p> <h2>Attribution statement</h2> <p>Attribution may be required if you are:</p> <ul><li>Adapting an open textbook</li> <li>Required to give credit for the graphic or image you are using</li> <li>Include the CC BY licence in your attribution statement</li> </ul> <p>For more information on best practices for attribution statements, see <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-captions-attributions/#attributions" rel="noopener" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/selfpublishguide/chapter/resources-captions-attributions/#attributions">Attributions in the <em>Self-Publishing Guide</em></a>.</p> <h2>Licensing</h2> <p>Visit <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/" rel="noopener" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/">Creative Commons</a> to learn about the various licensing types.

The service is print on demand, which means that a student must prepay for their print copy before picking it up at the bookstore. Instructors are able to set up this service by using two existing procedures: the bookstore’s Verba Collect system and the printshop’s Course Manual Requisition form. KPU also provides a <a href="https://media.kpu.ca/media/Print+on+demand+setup+tutorial/0_izv6teqn" data-url="https://media.kpu.ca/media/Print+on+demand+setup+tutorial/0_izv6teqn">print on demand setup tutorial video</a>.</li> </ul> <h2>North Island College</h2> <ul><li>When an open textbook is adopted by faculty, staff in the purchasing and print department help create a PoD file, which is listed like a textbook option on the course description, visible in the book search and the bookstore. If a student wishes to order a print copy, they go to one of the college’s bookstores and order and pay for it. The order is then sent to purchasing or the printshop, and the book is printed for that student and returned to the bookstore for them to pick up. Faculty provide information about open textbooks they’ve adopted to purchasing staff on their textbook requisitions. Purchasing then works with the appropriate departments on things like copyright and licensing in order to create the PoD file. <ul><li>For more information, contact retailpurchasing@nic.bc.ca.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h2>University of British Columbia</h2> <ul><li>UBC Bookstore lists “Open Educational Resources” on its <a href="https://bookstore.ubc.ca/instructors-course-materials-resources" data-url="https://bookstore.ubc.ca/instructors-course-materials-resources">UBC Instructors: Course Materials Resources</a> page and provides a <a href="https://shop.bookstore.ubc.ca/c-532-open-educational-resources-for-instructors.aspx" data-url="https://shop.bookstore.ubc.ca/c-532-open-educational-resources-for-instructors.aspx">video for faculty wanting to adopt an open textbook</a> or other OER.
