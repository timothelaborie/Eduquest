Today’s users take for granted the many benefits found in a database system. However, it wasn’t that long ago that computers relied on a much less elegant and costly approach to data management called the file-based system.</p> <h2>File-based System</h2> <p>One way to keep information on a computer is to store it in permanent files. A company system has a number of application programs; each of them is designed&nbsp;to manipulate data files. These application programs have been written at the&nbsp;request of the users in the organization. New applications are&nbsp;added to the system as the need arises. The system just described is called the <em>file-based system</em>.</p> <p>Consider a traditional banking system that&nbsp;uses the file-based system to manage the organization’s data shown in Figure 1.1. As we can see, there are different departments in the bank. Each has its&nbsp;own applications that manage and manipulate different data files. For banking systems, the programs may be used&nbsp;to debit or credit an account, find the balance of an account, add a new mortgage loan and generate monthly statements.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_159" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-159" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/FileBased-300x1701.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/FileBased-300x1701.jpg"><img class="wp-image-159 size-full" alt="Diagram with three coloured drawings: one of a woman and two men sitting and talking; the second shows a man shaking hands with a woman, both are standing and holding briefcases; the third is of a woman sitting.

Example of a file-based system used by banks to manage data.</div></div> <h3>Disadvantages of the file-based approach</h3> <p>Using the file-based system to keep organizational information has a number of disadvantages. Listed below are five examples.</p> <h4>Data redundancy</h4> <p>Often, within an organization, files and applications are created by different programmers from various departments over long periods of time. This can lead to <em>data redundancy, </em>a situation that occurs in a database when a field&nbsp;needs to be updated in more than one table. This practice can lead to several problems such as:</p> <ul><li>Inconsistency in data format</li> <li>The same information being&nbsp;kept in several different places (files)</li> <li><em>Data inconsistency</em>, a situation where various copies of the same data are conflicting, wastes storage space and duplicates effort</li> </ul> <h4>Data isolation</h4> <p><em>Data isolation</em> &nbsp;is a property <span style="color: #000000;">that determines when and how changes made by one operation become visible to other concurrent </span>users and systems.&nbsp;This issue occurs in a concurrency situation. This is a problem because:</p> <ul><li>It is difficult for new applications to retrieve the appropriate data, which might be stored in various files.</li> </ul> <h4>Integrity problems</h4> <p>Problems with <em>data integrity</em><span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;</span>is another disadvantage of using a file-based system. It refers to the maintenance and assurance that the data in a database are correct and consistent.&nbsp;Factors to consider when addressing this issue are:</p> <ul><li>Data values must satisfy certain consistency constraints that are specified in the application programs.</li> <li>It is difficult to make changes to the application programs in order to enforce new constraints.</li> </ul> <h4>Security problems</h4> <p>Security can be a problem with a file-based approach because:&nbsp;</p> <ul><li>There are constraints regarding accessing privileges.</li> <li>Application requirements are added to the system in an ad-hoc manner so it is difficult to enforce constraints.</li> </ul> <h4>Concurrency access</h4> <p><em>Concurrency</em> is the ability of the database to allow multiple users access to the same record without adversely affecting transaction processing. A file-based system must manage, or prevent, concurrency by the application programs. Typically, in a file-based system, when an application opens a file, that file is locked. This means that no one else has access to the file at the same time.</p> <p>In database systems, concurrency is managed thus allowing multiple users access to the same record. This is an important difference between database and file-based systems.</p> <h2>Database&nbsp;Approach</h2> <p>The difficulties that arise from using the file-based system have prompted the development of a new approach in managing large amounts of organizational information called the <em>database approach</em>.</p> <p>Databases and database technology play an important role in most areas where computers are used, including business, education and medicine. To understand the fundamentals of database systems, we will start by introducing some basic concepts in this area.</p> <h3>Role of databases in business</h3> <p>Everybody uses a database in some way, even if it is&nbsp;just to store information about their friends and family. That data might be written down or stored in a computer by using a word-processing program or it could be saved in a spreadsheet.&nbsp;However, the best way to store data is by using <em>database management software</em>. This&nbsp;is a powerful software tool that allows you to store, manipulate and retrieve data in a variety of different ways.</p> <p>Most companies keep track of customer information by storing it in a database.&nbsp;This data may include&nbsp;customers, employees, products, orders or anything else that assists the business with its&nbsp;operations.</p> <h3>The meaning of data</h3> <p>Data are factual information such as measurements or statistics about objects and concepts. We use data for discussions or as part of a calculation. Data can be a person, a place, an event, an action or any one of a number of things. A single fact is an element of data, or a <em>data element</em>.</p> <p>If data are information and information is what we are in the business of working with, you can start to see where you might be storing it. Data can be stored in:</p> <ul><li>Filing cabinets</li> <li>Spreadsheets</li> <li>Folders</li> <li>Ledgers</li> <li>Lists</li> <li>Piles of papers on your desk</li> </ul> <p>All of these items store information, and so too does a database. Because of the mechanical nature of databases, they have terrific power to manage and process the information they hold. This can make the information they house much more useful for your work.</p> <p>With this understanding of data, we can start to see how a tool with the capacity to store a collection of data and organize it, conduct a rapid search, retrieve and process, might make a difference to how we can use data.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-3-characteristics-and-benefits-of-a-database" title="Chapter 3 Characteristics and Benefits of a Database"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">3</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3 Characteristics and Benefits of a Database</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Managing information means taking care of it so that it works for us and is useful for the tasks we perform. By using a DBMS, the information we collect and add to its database is no longer subject to accidental disorganization. It becomes more accessible and integrated with the rest of our work. Managing information using a database allows us to become strategic users of the data we have.</p> <p>We often need to access and re-sort data for various uses. These may include:</p> <ul><li>Creating mailing lists</li> <li>Writing management reports</li> <li>Generating lists of selected news stories</li> <li>Identifying various client needs</li> </ul> <p>The processing power of a database allows it to manipulate the data it houses, so it can:</p> <ul><li>Sort</li> <li>Match</li> <li>Link</li> <li>Aggregate</li> <li>Skip fields</li> <li>Calculate</li> <li>Arrange</li> </ul> <p>Because of the versatility of databases, we find them powering all sorts of projects. A database can be linked to:</p> <ul><li>A website that is capturing registered users</li> <li>A client-tracking application for social service organizations</li> <li>A medical record system for a health care facility</li> <li>Your personal address book in your email client</li> <li>A collection of word-processed documents</li> <li>A system that issues airline reservations</li> </ul> <h2>Characteristics and Benefits of a Database</h2> <p>There are a number of characteristics that distinguish the database approach from&nbsp;the file-based system or approach. This chapter describes the benefits (and features) of the database system.</p> <h3>Self-describing nature of a database system</h3> <p>A database system is referred to as <em>self-describing</em> because it not only contains the database itself, but also <i>metadata&nbsp;</i>which defines and describes the data and relationships between tables in the database. This information is used by the DBMS software or database users if needed. This separation <span style="color: #000000;">of data and information about the data</span> makes a database system totally different from the traditional file-based system in which the data definition is part of the application programs.</p> <h3>Insulation between program and data</h3> <p>In the file-based system, the structure of the data files is defined in the application programs so if a user wants to change the structure of a file, all the programs that access that file might need to be changed as well.</p> <p>On the other hand, in the database approach, the data structure is stored in the system catalogue and not in the programs. Therefore, one change is all that is needed <span style="color: #000000;">to change the structure of a file</span>. This insulation <span style="color: #000000;">between</span> the programs and data is also called program-data independence.</p> <h3>Support for multiple views of data</h3> <p>A database supports multiple views of data.&nbsp; A <em>view</em> is a subset of the database, which is defined and dedicated for particular users of the system. Multiple users in the system might have different views of the system. Each view might contain only the data of interest to a user or group of users.</p> <h3>Sharing of data and multiuser system</h3> <p>Current database systems are designed for multiple users. That is,&nbsp;they allow many users to access the same database at the same time. This access is achieved through features called <em>concurrency control strategies</em>. These strategies ensure that the data accessed are always correct and that <span style="color: #000000;">data integrity is maintained.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span style="color: #000000;">The design of modern multiuser database systems is a great improvement from those in the past which restricted usage to one person at a time. </span></p> <h3>Control of data redundancy</h3> <p>In the database approach, ideally, each data item is stored in only one place in the database. In some cases, data redundancy still exists to improve system performance, but such redundancy is controlled by application programming<span style="color: #ff0000;"></span> and kept to minimum by introducing as little redudancy as possible when designing the database.</p> <h3>Data sharing</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">The integration of all the data, for an organization, within a database system has many advantages. First, it allows for data sharing among employees and others who have access to the system. Second, it gives users the ability to generate more information from a given amount of data than would be possible without the integration.</span></p> <h3>Enforcement of integrity constraints</h3> <p>Database management systems must provide the ability to define and enforce certain constraints to ensure that users enter valid informatio<span style="color: #333333;">n and maintain data integrity.</span>&nbsp;A <em>database constraint</em> is a restriction or rule that dictates what can be entered or edited in a table such as a postal code using a certain format or adding a valid city in the City field.</p> <p>There are many types of database constraints. <em>Data type</em>, for example, determines the sort of data permitted in a field, for example numbers only. <em>Data uniqueness </em>such as the primary key ensures that no duplicates are entered. Constraints can be simple (field based) or complex (programming).</p> <h3>Restriction of unauthorized access</h3> <p>Not all users of a database system will have the same accessing privileges. For example, one user might have <em>read-only access</em> (i.e., the ability to read a file but not make changes), while another might have <em>read and write privileges</em>, which is the ability to both read and modify a file. For this reason, a database management system should provide a security subsystem to create and control different types of user accounts and restrict unauthorized access.</p> <h3>Data independence</h3> <p><span style="color: #000000;">Another advantage of a database management system is how it allows for data independence. In other words, the system data descriptions or data describing data (metadata) are separated from the application programs. This is possible because changes to the data structure are&nbsp;handled by the database management system and&nbsp; are not embedded in the program itself.</span></p> <h3>Transaction processing</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;A database management system must include concurrency control subsystems. This feature ensures that data remains consistent and valid during transaction processing even if several users update the same information.</span></p> <h3>Provision for multiple views of data</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">By its very nature, a DBMS permits many users to have access to its database either individually or simultaneously. It is not important for users to be aware of how and where the data they access is stored</span></p> <h3>Backup and recovery facilities</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">Backup and recovery are methods that allow you to protect your data from loss.&nbsp; The database system provides a separate process, from that of a network backup, for backing up and recovering data. If a hard drive fails and the database stored on the hard drive is not accessible, the only way to recover the database is from a backup.<br /> If a computer system fails in the middle of a complex update process, the recovery subsystem is responsible for making sure that the database is restored to its original state. These are two more benefits of a database management system.</span></p> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Key Terms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>concurrency control strategies</strong>: features of a database that allow several users access to the same data item at the same time</p> <p><strong>data type</strong>:&nbsp;determines the sort of data permitted in a field, for example numbers only</p> <p><strong>data uniqueness</strong>:&nbsp;ensures that no duplicates are entered</p> <p><strong>database constraint</strong>: a restriction that determines what is allowed to be entered or edited in a table</p> <p><strong>metadata</strong>:&nbsp;defines and describes the data and relationships<span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #000000;">between</span></span>&nbsp;tables in the database</p> <p><strong>read and write privileges:</strong>&nbsp;the ability to both read and modify a file</p> <p><strong>read-only</strong> <strong>access:</strong>&nbsp;the ability to read a file but not make changes</p> <p><strong>self-describing</strong>: a&nbsp;database system is referred to as self-describing because it not only contains the database itself, but also metadatawhich defines and describes the data and relationships between tables in the database</p> <p><strong>view</strong>: a subset of the database</p> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>How is a DBMS distinguished from a file-based system?</li> <li>What is data independence and why is it important?</li> <li>What is the purpose of managing information?</li> <li>Discuss the uses of databases in a business environment.</li> <li>What is metadata?</li> </ol> </div> </div> <h2>Attribution</h2> <p>This chapter of&nbsp;<em>Database Design</em> is a derivative copy of&nbsp;<a href="http://cnx.org/contents/b57b8760-6898-469d-a0f7-06e0537f6817@1" data-url="http://cnx.org/contents/b57b8760-6898-469d-a0f7-06e0537f6817@1">Database System Concepts</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nguyen Kim Anh&nbsp;licensed under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" data-url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 license</a></p> <p>The following material was written by Adrienne Watt:</p> <ol><li>Introduction</li> <li>Key Terms</li> <li>Exercises</li> </ol> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-4-types-of-database-models" title="Chapter 4 Types of Data Models"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">4</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4 Types of Data Models</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt &#038; Nelson Eng</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h2>High-level Conceptual <span style="color: #000000;">Data</span> Models</h2> <p>High-level conceptual data models provide concepts for presenting data in ways that are close to the way people perceive data. A typical example is the entity relationship model, which uses main concepts like entities, attributes and relationships. An entity represents a real-world object such as an employee or a project. The&nbsp;entity has attributes that&nbsp;represent properties such as an employee’s name, address and birthdate. A relationship represents an association among entities; for example, an employee works on many projects. A&nbsp;relationship exists between the employee and each project.</p> <h2>Record-based Logical <span style="color: #000000;">Data</span> Models</h2> <p>Record-based logical data models provide concepts users&nbsp;can&nbsp;understand&nbsp;but are not too far from the way data is stored in the computer.

For example, in the membership system at Science World, each membership has many members (see Figure 2.2 in Chapter 2). The membership identifier, expiry date and address information are fields in the membership. The members are individuals such as Mickey, Minnie, Mighty, Door, Tom, King, Man and Moose. Each record is said to be an <em>instance</em> of the membership table.</li> </ul> <ul><li><span style="color: #333333;">The <em>network model</em> represents data as record types.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-5-data-modelling" title="Chapter 5 Data Modelling"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">5</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5 Data Modelling</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p><em>Data modelling</em> is the first step in the process of database design. This step is sometimes considered to be&nbsp;a high-level and abstract design phase, also referred to as conceptual design. The aim of this phase is&nbsp;to describe:</p> <ul><li>The&nbsp;data contained in the database (e.g., entities: students, lecturers, courses, subjects)</li> <li>The relationships between data items (e.g., students are supervised by lecturers; lecturers teach courses)</li> <li>The constraints on data (e.g., student number has exactly eight&nbsp;digits; a subject has four&nbsp;or six&nbsp;units of credit only)</li> </ul> <p>In the second step, the data items, the relationships and the constraints are all expressed using the concepts provided by the high-level data model. Because these concmepts do not include the implementation details, the result of the data modelling process is a (semi) formal representation of the database structure. This result is quite easy to understand so it is used as reference to make sure that all the user’s requirements are met.</p> <p>The third step is database design. During this step, we might have two sub-steps:&nbsp;one called <em>database logical design</em>, which defines a database in a data model of a specific DBMS, and another called <em>database physical design</em>, which defines the internal database storage structure, file organization or indexing techniques. These two sub-steps&nbsp;are database implementation and operations/user interfaces building steps.</p> <p>In the database design phases, data are represented using a certain data model. The <em>data model</em> is a collection of concepts or notations for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and data constraints. Most data models also include a set of basic operations for manipulating data in the database.</p> <h2>Degrees of Data Abstraction</h2> <p>In this section we will look at the database design process in terms of specificity.&nbsp;Just as any design starts at a high level and proceeds to an ever-increasing level of detail, so does database design.&nbsp;For example, when building a home, you start with how many bedrooms and bathrooms the home will have, whether it&nbsp;will be on one level or multiple levels, etc.&nbsp;The next step is to get an architect to design the home from a more structured perspective. This level gets more detailed with respect to actual room sizes, how the home will be wired, where the plumbing fixtures will be placed, etc.&nbsp;The last step is to hire a contractor to build the home.&nbsp;That’s looking at the design from a high level of abstraction to an increasing&nbsp;level of&nbsp;detail.</p> <p>The database design is very much like that. It starts with users identifying the business rules; then the database designers and analysts create the database design; and then the database administrator implements the design using a DBMS.</p> <p>The following subsections summarize the models in order of decreasing level of&nbsp;abstraction.</p> <h3>External models</h3> <ul><li>Represent the user’s view of the database</li> <li>Contain multiple different external views</li> <li>Are&nbsp;closely related to the real world as perceived by each user</li> </ul> <h3>Conceptual models</h3> <ul><li>Provide flexible data-structuring capabilities</li> <li>Present a “community view”: the logical structure of the entire database</li> <li>Contain data stored in the database</li> <li>Show relationships among data including: <ul><li>Constraints</li> <li>Semantic information (e.g., business rules)</li> <li>Security and&nbsp;integrity information</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consider a database as a collection of entities (objects) of various kinds</li> <li>Are the basis for identification and high-level description of main data objects; they avoid details</li> <li>Are database independent regardless of the database you will be using</li> </ul> <h3>Internal models</h3> <p>The three&nbsp;best-known models of this kind are the relational data model, the network data model and the hierarchical data model. These internal models:</p> <ul><li>Consider a database as a collection of fixed-size records</li> <li>Are&nbsp;closer to the physical level or file structure</li> <li>Are&nbsp;a representation of the database as seen by the DBMS.</li> <li>Require the designer to match the conceptual model’s characteristics and constraints to those of the selected implementation model</li> <li>Involve mapping the entities in the conceptual model to the tables in the relational model</li> </ul> <h3>Physical models</h3> <ul><li>Are the physical representation of the database</li> <li>Have the lowest level of abstractions</li> <li>Are&nbsp;how the data is stored; they deal with <ul><li>Run-time performance</li> <li>Storage utilization and&nbsp;compression</li> <li>File organization and&nbsp;access methods</li> <li>Data encryption</li> </ul> </li> <li>Are the physical level – managed by the <em>operating system</em><em>&nbsp;(OS)</em></li> <li>Provide concepts that describe the details of how data are stored in the computer’s memory</li> </ul> <h2>Data Abstraction Layer</h2> <p>In a pictorial view, you can see how the different models work together. Let’s look at this from the highest level, the external model.</p> <p>The external model is the end user’s view of the data. Typically a database is an enterprise system that serves the needs of multiple departments. However, one department is not interested in seeing other departments’ data&nbsp;(e.g., the&nbsp;human resources (HR) department does not care to view the sales department’s data). Therefore, one user view will differ from another.</p> <p>The external model requires that the designer subdivide a set of requirements and constraints into functional modules that can be examined within the framework of their external models (e.g., human resources versus sales).</p> <p>As a data designer, you need to understand all the data so that you can build an enterprise-wide database. Based on the needs of various departments, the conceptual model is the first model created.</p> <p>At this stage, the conceptual model is independent of both software and hardware. It does not depend on the DBMS software used to implement the model. It does not depend on the hardware used in the implementation of the model. Changes in either hardware or DBMS software have no effect on the database design at the conceptual level.</p> <p>Once a DBMS is selected, you can then implement it. This is the internal model. Here you create all the tables, constraints, keys, rules, etc.&nbsp; This is often referred to as the <em>logical design</em>.</p> <p>The physical model is simply the way the data is stored on disk. Each database vendor has its&nbsp;own way of storing the data.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_42" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-42" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Table-Description-300x146.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Table-Description-300x146.jpg"><img class="wp-image-42" alt="Three stick figures and the words &amp;quot;End Users&amp;quot; at the top.

Data abstraction layers.</div></div> <h2>Schemas</h2> <p>A <em>schema</em> is an overall description of a database, and it is usually represented by the&nbsp;<em>entity relationship diagram (ERD)</em>. There are many subschemas that represent external models and thus display external views of the data. Below is a list of items to consider during the design process of a database.</p> <ul><li>External schemas: there are multiple</li> <li>Multiple subschemas: these display multiple external views of the data</li> <li>Conceptual schema: there is only one. This schema includes data items, relationships and&nbsp;constraints, all represented in an ERD.</li> <li>Physical schema: there is only one</li> </ul> <h2>Logical and Physical Data Independence</h2> <p><em>Data independence</em> refers to the immunity of user applications to changes made in the definition and organization of data. Data abstractions expose only those items that are important or pertinent to the user. Complexity is hidden from the database user.</p> <p>Data independence and operation independence together form&nbsp;the feature of data abstraction. There are two types of data independence: logical and physical.</p> <h3>Logical data independence</h3> <p>A <em>logical schema </em>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;conceptual design of the database done on paper or a whiteboard, much like architectural drawings for a house. The ability to change the logical schema,&nbsp;without changing the <em>external schema</em>&nbsp;or user view,&nbsp;&nbsp;is called <em>logical data independence</em>. For example, the addition or removal of new entities, attributes or relationships to this <em>conceptual schema</em> should be possible without having to change existing external schemas or rewrite existing application programs.&nbsp;<em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In other words, changes to&nbsp;the logical schema (e.g., alterations to the structure of the database like adding a column or other tables) should not affect the function of the application (external views).</p> <h3>Physical data independence</h3> <p><em>Physical data independence</em> refers to the immunity of the internal model to changes in the physical model. The logical schema stays unchanged even though changes are made to file organization or storage structures, storage devices or indexing strategy.</p> <p>Physical data independence deals with hiding the details of the storage structure from user applications. The applications should not be involved with these issues, since there is no difference in the operation carried out against the data.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Key Terms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><strong>conceptual model</strong>:&nbsp;the logical structure of the entire database <p><strong>conceptual schema</strong>: another term for logical schema</p> <p><strong>data independence</strong>:&nbsp;the immunity of user&nbsp;applications&nbsp;to changes made in the definition and organization of data</p> <p><strong>data model</strong>:a collection of concepts or notations for describing data, data relationships, data semantics and data constraints</p> <p><strong>data modelling</strong>:&nbsp;the first step in the process of database design</p> <p><strong>database logical design</strong>:&nbsp; defines a database in a data model of a specific database management system</p> <p><strong>database physical design<em>:</em></strong>&nbsp;defines the internal database storage structure, file organization or indexing techniques</p> <p><strong>entity relationship diagram (ERD)</strong>: a data model describing the database showing tables, attributes and relationships</p> <p><strong>external model</strong>: &nbsp;represents the user’s view of the database</p> <p><strong>external schema</strong>: user view</p> <p><strong>internal model:</strong>&nbsp;a representation of the database as seen by the DBMS</p> <p><strong>logical data independence</strong>: the ability to change the logical schema without changing the external schema</p> <p><strong>logical design</strong>: where you create all the tables, constraints, keys, rules, etc.</p> <p><strong>logical schema</strong>:&nbsp;a&nbsp;conceptual design of the database done on paper or a whiteboard, much like architectural drawings for a house</p> <p><strong>operating system (OS)</strong>: manages the physical level of the physical model</p> <p><strong>physical data independence</strong>: the immunity of the internal model to changes in the physical model</p> <p><strong>physical model</strong>:&nbsp;the physical representation of the database</p> <p><strong>schema</strong>: an overall description of a database</p> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>Describe the purpose of a conceptual design.</li> <li>How is a conceptual design different from a logical design?</li> <li>What is an external model?</li> <li>What is a conceptual model?</li> <li>What is an internal model?</li> <li>What is a physical model?</li> <li>Which model does the database administrator work with?</li> <li>Which model does the end user work with?</li> <li>What is logical data independence?</li> <li>What is physical data independence?</li> </ol> <p>Also see <em>Appendix A: University Registration Data Model Example</em></p> </div> </div> <h2>Attribution</h2> <p>This chapter of&nbsp;<em>Database Design</em>&nbsp;is a derivative copy of&nbsp;<a href="http://cnx.org/contents/b57b8760-6898-469d-a0f7-06e0537f6817@1" data-url="http://cnx.org/contents/b57b8760-6898-469d-a0f7-06e0537f6817@1">Database System Concepts</a>&nbsp;by&nbsp;Nguyen Kim Anh&nbsp;licensed under&nbsp;<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/" data-url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">Creative Commons Attribution License 3.0 license</a></p> <p>The following material was written by Adrienne Watt:</p> <ul><li style="list-style-type: none;"><ol><li>Some or all of the introduction, degrees of data abstraction, data abstraction layer</li> <li>Key Terms</li> <li>Exercises</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-6-classification-of-database-systems" title="Chapter 6 Classification of Database Management Systems"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">6</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 6 Classification of Database Management Systems</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Database management systems can be classified based on several criteria, such as the data model, user numbers and database distribution, all described below.</p> <h2>Classification Based on D<span style="color: #333333;">ata</span>&nbsp;Model</h2> <p>The most popular data model in use today is the relational data model. Well-known DBMSs like Oracle, MS SQL Server, DB2 and MySQL support this model. Other traditional models, such as hierarchical data models and network data models, are still used in industry mainly&nbsp;on mainframe platforms. However, they are not commonly used due to their complexity. These are all referred to as <em>traditional</em>&nbsp;<em>models</em> because they preceded the relational model.</p> <p>In recent years, the newer <em>object-oriented data models</em>&nbsp;were introduced. This model is a database management system in which information is represented in the form of objects as used in object-oriented programming. Object-oriented databases are different from relational databases, which are table-oriented. Object-oriented database management systems (OODBMS) combine database capabilities with object-oriented programming language capabilities.</p> <p>The object-oriented models have&nbsp;not caught on as expected so are&nbsp;not in widespread use. Some examples of object-oriented DBMSs are O2, ObjectStore and Jasmine.</p> <h2>Classification Based&nbsp;on User Numbers</h2> <p>A DBMS can be classification based on the number of users it supports. It can be a <em>single-user database system</em>, which supports one user at a time, or a <em>multiuser database system</em>, which supports multiple users concurrently.</p> <h2>Classification Based on Database Distribution</h2> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">There are four main distribution systems for database systems and these, in turn, can be used to classify the DBMS.</span>&nbsp;</span></p> <h3>Centralized systems</h3> <p>With a <em>centralized database system</em>,&nbsp;the DBMS and database&nbsp;are stored at a single site that is used by several other systems too. This is illustrated in Figure 6.1.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_41" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg"><img width="300" height="174" class="wp-image-41" alt="Diagram showing one large computer monitor and four small ones labelled Workstations or Terminals, with arrows between them.

Each book catalogue had a barcode field similar to those on supermarket products.</p> <h3>Distributed database system</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">In a <em>distributed database system</em>, the actual database and the DBMS software are distributed from various sites that are connected by a computer network, as shown in Figure 6.2.</span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_45" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-45" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/EntitySet-300x86.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/EntitySet-300x86.jpg"><img width="300" height="217" class="wp-image-45" alt="Diagram showing three circles, separately labelled Site 1-3, and each containing several computer monitors and a computer tower.

Data exchange between these various sites can be handled easily. For example, library information systems by the same vendor, such as Geac Computer Corporation, use the same DBMS software which allows easy data exchange between the various Geac library sites.</p> <h3>Heterogeneous distributed database systems</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">In a <em>heterogeneous distributed database system</em>, different sites might use different DBMS software, but there is additional common software to support data exchange between these sites.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-7-the-relational-data-model" title="Chapter 7 The Relational Data Model"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">7</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 7 The Relational Data Model</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>The relational data model was introduced by E. F. Codd in 1970. Currently, it is the most widely used data model.</p> <p>The relational model has provided the basis for:</p> <ul><li>Research on the theory of data/relationship/constraint</li> <li>Numerous database design methodologies</li> <li>The standard database access language called s<em>tructured query language (SQL)</em></li> <li>Almost all modern commercial database management systems</li> </ul> <p>The relational data model describes the world as “a collection of inter-related relations (or tables).”</p> <h2>Fundamental Concepts in the Relational Data Model</h2> <h3>Relation</h3> <p>A&nbsp;<em>relation,&nbsp;</em>also known as a <em>table</em> or <em>file</em>,&nbsp;is a subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains characterized by a name.&nbsp;And within&nbsp;a table, each row represents a group of related data values. A <em>row</em>, or record, is also known as a <em>tuple</em>. The columns in a table is a field and is also referred to as an attribute. You can also think of it this way: an attribute is used to define the record and a record contains a set of attributes.</p> <p>The steps below outline the logic between a relation and its domains.</p> <ol><li>Given<em>&nbsp;n</em>&nbsp;domains&nbsp;are&nbsp;denoted by D1, D2, … Dn</li> <li>And<em>&nbsp;r</em>&nbsp;is a relation defined on these domains</li> <li>Then&nbsp;&nbsp;r ⊆ D1×D2×…×Dn</li> </ol> <h3>Table</h3> <p>A database is composed of multiple tables and each<em>&nbsp;</em>table holds the data. Figure 7.1 shows a database that contains three tables.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_29" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-29" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Banking-Systems-RDBMS-300x195.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Banking-Systems-RDBMS-300x195.jpg"><img class="wp-image-29" src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/School-Database-Fig-1-300x221.jpg" alt="Blue cylinder with three white rectangles each with a list of words." width="300" height="221" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-29">Figure 7.1. Database with three tables.</div></div> <h3>Column</h3> <p>A database stores pieces of information or facts in an organized way. Understanding how to use and get the most out of databases requires us to understand that method of organization.</p> <p>The principal storage units are called <em>columns</em>&nbsp;or <em>fields</em>&nbsp;or <em>attributes</em>. These house the basic components of data into which&nbsp;your content can be broken down. When deciding which fields to create, you need to think generically about your information, for example, drawing out the common components of the information that you will store in the database and avoiding the specifics that distinguish one item from another.</p> <p>Look at the example of an ID card in Figure 7.2 to see the relationship between fields and their data.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-41" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg"><img class="wp-image-41 size-full" src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg" alt="Record-300x177" width="300" height="177" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177-65x38.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Record-300x177-225x132.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7.2. Example of an ID card by A. Watt.</div></div> <h3>Domain</h3> <p>A <em>domain</em> is the original sets of atomic values used to model data. By <em>atomic value</em>, we mean that each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the relational model is concerned. For example:</p> <ul><li>The domain of Marital Status has a set of possibilities:&nbsp;Married, Single, Divorced.</li> <li>The domain of Shift has the set of all possible days: {Mon, Tue, Wed…}.</li> <li>The domain of Salary is the set of all floating-point numbers greater than 0 and less than 200,000.</li> <li>The domain of First Name is the set of character strings that represents names of people.</li> </ul> <p>In summary, a domain is a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed to contain. This is based on various properties and the data type for the column. We will discuss data types in another chapter.</p> <h3>Records</h3> <p>Just as the content of any one document or item needs to be broken down into its constituent bits of data for storage in the fields, the link between them also needs to be available so that they can be reconstituted into their whole form. Records allow us to do this. <em>Records</em> contain fields that are related, such as a customer or an employee. As noted earlier, a tuple is another term used for record.</p> <p>Records and fields form the basis of all databases. A simple table &nbsp;gives us the clearest picture of how records and fields work together in a&nbsp;database storage project.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-136" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/RDBMS-300x2091.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/RDBMS-300x2091.jpg"><img class="wp-image-136" src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Table-Description-300x146.jpg" width="300" height="146" alt="" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 7.3. Example of a simple table by A. Watt.</div></div> <p>The <span style="color: #333333;">simple table</span> example in Figure 7.3 shows us how fields can hold a range of different sorts of data. This one has:</p> <ul><li>A Record ID field: this is an ordinal number; its data type is an integer.</li> <li>A PubDate field: this is displayed as day/month/year; its data type is date.</li> <li>An Author field: this is displayed as&nbsp;Initial. Surname; its data type is text.</li> <li>A Title field text: free text can be entered here.</li> </ul> <p>You can command the database to sift through its data and organize it in a particular way. For example, you can request that a selection of records be limited by date: 1. all before a given date, 2. all after a given date or 3. all between two given dates. Similarly, you can choose to have records sorted by date. Because the field, or record, containing the data is set up as a Date field, the database reads the information in the Date field not just as numbers separated by slashes, but rather, as dates that&nbsp;must be ordered according to a calendar system.</p> <h3>Degree</h3> <p>The <em>degree</em> is the number of attributes in a table. In our example in Figure 7.3, the degree is 4.</p> <h2>Properties of a Table</h2> <ul><li>A table has a name that is distinct from all other tables in the database.</li> <li>There are no duplicate rows; each row is distinct.</li> <li>Entries in columns are atomic. The table<span style="color: #333333;">&nbsp;does&nbsp;</span>not contain repeating groups or multivalued attributes.</li> <li>Entries from columns are from the same domain based on their data type including: <ul><li>number (numeric, integer, float, smallint,…)</li> <li>character (string)</li> <li>date</li> <li>logical (true or false)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Operations combining different data types are disallowed.</li> <li>Each attribute has a distinct name.</li> <li>The sequence of columns is insignificant.</li> <li>The sequence of rows is insignificant.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Key Terms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p><strong>atomic value</strong>:&nbsp;each value in the domain is indivisible as far as the relational model is concerned<strong>attribute</strong>:&nbsp;principle storage unit in a database</p> <p><strong>column: </strong>see <em>attribute</em></p> <p><strong>degree</strong>: number of attributes in a table</p> <p><strong>domain</strong>:&nbsp;the original sets of atomic values used to model data;&nbsp;a set of acceptable values that a column is allowed to contain</p> <p><strong>field</strong>:&nbsp;see&nbsp;<em>attribute</em></p> <p><strong>file</strong>:see <em>relation</em></p> <p><strong>record</strong>:&nbsp;contains fields that are related; <em>see tuple</em></p> <p><strong>relation</strong>: a&nbsp;subset of the Cartesian product of a list of domains characterized by a name; the technical term for table or file</p> <p><strong>row</strong>: <em>see tuple</em></p> <p><strong>structured query language (SQL)</strong>: the standard database access language</p> <p><strong>table:</strong>see <em>relation</em></p> <p><strong>tuple</strong>:&nbsp;a technical term for row or record</p> <h4>Terminology Key</h4> <p>Several of the terms used in this chapter are synonymous.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-8-entity-relationship-model" title="Chapter 8 The Entity Relationship Data Model"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">8</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 8 The Entity Relationship Data Model</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>The <em>entity relationship&nbsp;(ER) data model</em> has existed for over 35 years. It&nbsp;is well suited to data modelling for use with databases because it is fairly abstract and is easy to discuss and explain. ER models are readily translated to relations.&nbsp;ER models, also called an ER schema, are represented by ER diagrams.</p> <p>ER modelling is based on two concepts:</p> <ul><li>Entities<em>,</em>&nbsp;defined as tables that hold specific information (data)</li> <li><em>Relationships,</em>&nbsp;defined as the associations or interactions between entities</li> </ul> <p>Here is an example of how these two concepts might be combined in an ER data model:&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;">Prof. Ba (entity)</span> <span style="color: #339966;">teaches (relationship)</span> <span style="color: #0000ff;">the Database Systems&nbsp;course (entity)</span>.</p> <p>For the rest of this chapter, we will use a sample database called the COMPANY database to illustrate the concepts of the ER&nbsp;model. This database contains information about employees, departments and projects. Important points to note include:</p> <ul><li>There are several departments in the company. Each department has a unique identification, a name, location of the office and a particular employee who manages the department.</li> <li>A department controls a number of projects, each of which has a unique name, a unique number and a&nbsp;budget.</li> <li>Each employee has a name, identification number, address, salary and birthdate. An employee is assigned to one department but can join in several projects. We need to record the start date of the employee in each project. We also need to know the direct supervisor of each employee.</li> <li>We want to keep track of the dependents for each employee. Each dependent has a name, birthdate and relationship with the employee.</li> </ul> <h2>Entity, Entity Set and Entity Type</h2> <p>An <em>entity</em> is an object in the real world with an independent existence that&nbsp;can be differentiated from other objects. An entity might be</p> <ul><li>An object with physical existence&nbsp;(e.g., a lecturer, a student, a car)</li> <li>An object with conceptual existence&nbsp;(e.g., a course, a job, a position)</li> </ul> <p>Entities can be classified based on their strength. An entity is considered weak if its tables are existence dependent.</p> <ul><li>That is, it cannot exist without a relationship with another entity</li> <li>Its primary key is derived from the primary key of the parent entity <ul><li>The Spouse table, in the COMPANY database, is a weak entity because its primary key is dependent on the Employee table. Without a corresponding employee record, the spouse record would not exist.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>An entity is considered strong if it can exist apart from all of its related entities.</p> <ul><li>Kernels are strong entities.</li> <li>A table without a foreign key or a table that contains a foreign key that&nbsp;can contain nulls&nbsp;is a strong entity</li> </ul> <p>Another term to know is <em>entity type</em> which defines a collection of similar entities.</p> <p>An <em>entity set</em> is a collection of entities of an entity type at a particular point of time. In an entity relationship diagram (ERD), an entity type is represented by a name in a box. For example, in Figure 8.1, the entity type is EMPLOYEE.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_46" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Attributes-300x106.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Attributes-300x106.jpg"><img width="300" height="106" class="wp-image-46" alt="A yellow rectangle with e1, e2 and en inside.

ERD with entity type EMPLOYEE.</div></div> <h3>Existence dependency</h3> <p>An entity’s existence is dependent on the existence of the related entity. It is existence-dependent if it has a mandatory foreign key&nbsp;(i.e.,&nbsp;a foreign key attribute that cannot be null). For example, in the COMPANY database, a Spouse entity is existence -dependent on the Employee&nbsp;entity.</p> <h2>Kinds of Entities</h2> <p>You should also be familiar with different kinds of entities including independent entities, dependent entities and characteristic entities. These are described below.</p> <h3>Independent entities</h3> <p><em>Independent entities</em>, also referred to as kernels, are the backbone of the database. They are&nbsp;what other tables are based on. <em>Kernels</em> have the following characteristics:</p> <ul><li>They are the building blocks of a database.</li> <li>The primary key may be simple or composite.</li> <li>The primary key is not a foreign key.</li> <li>They do not depend on another entity for their existence.</li> </ul> <p>If we refer back to our COMPANY database, examples of an independent entity include the Customer table, Employee table or Product table.</p> <h3>Dependent entities</h3> <p><em>Dependent entities</em>, also referred to as <em>derived entities</em>, depend on other tables for their meaning.&nbsp;These entities have the following characteristics:</p> <ul><li>Dependent entities are used to connect two kernels together.</li> <li>They are said to be existence dependent on two or more tables.</li> <li>Many to many relationships become associative tables with at least two foreign keys.</li> <li>They may contain other attributes.</li> <li>The foreign key identifies each associated table.</li> <li>There are three options for the primary key: <ol><li>Use a composite of foreign keys of associated tables if unique</li> <li>Use a composite of foreign keys and a qualifying column</li> <li>Create a new simple primary key</li> </ol> </li> </ul> <h3>Characteristic entities</h3> <p><em>Characteristic entities</em> provide more information about another table. These entities have the following characteristics:</p> <ul><li>They represent multivalued attributes.</li> <li>They describe other entities.</li> <li>They typically have a one to many relationship.</li> <li>The foreign key is used to further identify the characterized table.</li> <li>Options for primary key are as follows: <ol><li>Use a composite of foreign key plus a qualifying column</li> <li>Create a new simple primary key. In the COMPANY database, these might include: <ul><li>Employee (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EID,</span> Name, Address, Age, Salary) – EID is the simple primary key.</li> <li>EmployeePhone (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">EID, Phone</span>) – EID is part of a composite primary key. Here, EID is also a foreign key.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <h2>Attributes</h2> <p>Each entity is described by a set of attributes&nbsp;(e.g., Employee = (Name, Address, Birthdate (Age), Salary).</p> <p>Each attribute has a name, and is associated with an entity and a domain of legal values. However, the information about attribute domain is not presented on the ERD.</p> <p>In the entity relationship diagram, shown in Figure 8.2, each attribute is represented by an oval with a name inside.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_38" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-38" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Distributed-Systems-300x217.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Distributed-Systems-300x217.jpg"><img width="300" height="106" class="wp-image-38" alt="One blue rectangle with the word EMPLOYEE.

How attributes are represented in an ERD.</div></div> <h2>Types of Attributes</h2> <p>There are a few types of attributes you need to be familiar with. Some of these are to be left as is, but some need to be adjusted to facilitate representation in the relational model. This first section will discuss the types of attributes. Later on we will discuss fixing the attributes to fit correctly into the relational model.</p> <h3>Simple attributes</h3> <p><em>Simple attributes</em> are those drawn from the atomic value domains; they are also called <em>single-valued attributes</em>. In the COMPANY database, an example of this would be:&nbsp;Name = {John} ; Age = {23}</p> <h3>Composite attributes</h3> <p><em>Composite attributes</em> are those that consist of a hierarchy of attributes. <span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">Using our database example, and shown in Figure 8.3, Address may consist of Number, Street and Suburb. So this would be written as → Address = {59 + ‘Meek Street’ + ‘Kingsford’}</span></span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_32" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-32" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Network-data-model-300x244.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Network-data-model-300x244.jpg"><img width="300" height="133" class="wp-image-32" alt="Blue rectangle with the word EMPLOYEE.

Example of a derived attribute.</div></div> <h2>Keys</h2> <p>An important constraint on an entity&nbsp;is the key. The <em>key</em> is an attribute or a group of attributes whose values can be used to uniquely identify an individual entity in an entity set.</p> <h2>Types of Keys</h2> <p>There are several types of keys. These are described below.</p> <h3>Candidate key</h3> <p>A <em>candidate key</em> is a simple or composite key that is unique and minimal.&nbsp; It is unique because no two rows in a table may have the same value at any time. It is minimal because every column is necessary in order to attain uniqueness.</p> <p>From our COMPANY database example, if the entity is <strong>Employee</strong>(EID, First Name, Last Name, <em>SIN</em>, Address, Phone, BirthDate, Salary, DepartmentID), possible candidate keys are:</p> <ul><li>EID, SIN</li> <li>First Name and Last Name – assuming there is no one else in the company with the same name</li> <li>Last Name and DepartmentID – assuming two people with the same last name don’t work in the same department</li> </ul> <h3>Composite key</h3> <p>A <em>composite key</em> is composed of two or more attributes, but it must be minimal.</p> <p>Using the example from the candidate key section, possible composite&nbsp;keys are:</p> <ul><li>First Name and Last Name – assuming there is no one else in the company with the same name</li> <li>Last Name and Department ID – assuming two people with the same last name don’t work in the same department</li> </ul> <h3>Primary key</h3> <p><span style="color: #333333;">The primary key is a candidate key that is selected by the database designer to be used as an identifying mechanism for the whole entity set. It must uniquely identify tuples in a table and not be null. The primary key is indicated in the ER model by underlining the attribute.</span></p> <ul><li><span style="color: #333333;">A candidate key is selected by the design</span>er to uniquely identify tuples in a table. It must not be null.</li> <li>A key is chosen by the database designer to be used as an identifying mechanism for the whole entity set.&nbsp; This is referred to as the primary key. This key is indicated by underlining the attribute in the ER model.</li> </ul> <p>In the following example, EID is the primary key:</p> <p><strong>Employee</strong>(<span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #333333;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">EID</span></span>, First Name, Last Name, SIN, Address, Phone, BirthDate, Salary, DepartmentID)</p> <h3>Secondary key</h3> <p>A <em>secondary key</em> is an attribute used strictly for retrieval purposes (can be composite), for example: Phone and Last Name.</p> <h3>Alternate key</h3> <p><em>Alternate keys</em>&nbsp;are all candidate keys not chosen as the primary key.</p> <h3>Foreign key</h3> <p>A <em>foreign key (FK)</em> is an attribute in a table that references the primary key in another table OR it can be null. Both foreign and primary keys must be of the same data type.</p> <p>In the COMPANY database example below, DepartmentID is the foreign key:</p> <p><strong>Employee</strong>(EID, First Name, Last Name, SIN, Address, Phone, BirthDate, Salary, DepartmentID)</p> <h2>Nulls</h2> <p>A <em>null</em> is a special symbol, independent of data type, which means either unknown or inapplicable.

They are used to connect related information between tables.</p> <p><em>Relationship strength</em> is based on how the primary key of a related entity is defined. A weak, or non-identifying, relationship exists if the primary key of the related entity does not contain a primary key component of the parent entity. Company database examples include:</p> <ul><li>Customer(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CustID</span></strong>, CustName)</li> <li>Order(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OrderID</span></strong>, CustID, Date)</li> </ul> <p>A strong, or identifying, relationship exists when the primary key of the related entity contains the primary key component of the parent entity. Examples include:</p> <ul><li>Course(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CrsCode</span></strong>, DeptCode, Description)</li> <li>Class(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CrsCode, Section</span></strong>, ClassTime…)</li> </ul> <h2>Types of Relationships</h2> <p>Below are descriptions of the various types of relationships.</p> <h3>One to many (1:M) relationship</h3> <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><span style="color: #333333;">A one to many (1:M) relationship should be the norm in any relational database design and is found in all relational database environments.

It should be rare in any relational database design. In fact, it could indicate that two entities actually belong in the same table.</p> <p>An example from the COMPANY database is one employee is associated with one spouse, and one spouse is associated with one employee.</p> <h3>Many to many&nbsp;(M:N) relationships</h3> <p>For a many to many relationship, consider the following points:</p> <ul><li>It cannot be implemented as such in the relational model.</li> <li>It can be changed into two 1:M relationships.</li> <li>It can be implemented by breaking up to produce a set of 1:M relationships.</li> <li>It involves the implementation of a composite entity.</li> <li>Creates two or more 1:M relationships.</li> <li>The composite entity table must contain at least the primary keys of the original tables.</li> <li>The linking table contains multiple occurrences of the foreign key values.</li> <li>Additional attributes may be assigned as needed.</li> <li>It can avoid problems inherent in an&nbsp;M:N relationship by creating a composite entity or bridge entity. For example, an employee can work on many projects OR a project can have many employees working on it, depending on the business rules. Or,&nbsp;a student can have many classes and a class can hold many students.</li> </ul> <p>Figure 8.8 shows another another aspect of the M:N relationship where an employee has different start dates for different projects<span style="color: #000000;">.

In fact, the relational model supports the well-defined theory of constraints on attributes or tables. Constraints are useful because they allow a designer to specify the semantics of data in the database. <em>Constraints</em> are the rules that force DBMSs to check that data satisfies the semantics.</p> <h2>Domain Integrity</h2> <p>Domain restricts the values of attributes in the relation and is a constraint of the relational model. However, there are real-world semantics for data that cannot be specified if used only with domain constraints. We need more specific ways to state what data values are or are not allowed and which format is suitable for an attribute. For example, <span style="color: #333333;">the Employee ID (EID) must</span> be unique or the employee Birthdate is in the range [Jan 1, 1950, Jan 1, 2000]. Such information is provided in logical statements called <em>integrity constraints</em>.</p> <p>There are several kinds of integrity constraints, described below.</p> <h3>Entity integrity</h3> <p>To ensure <em>entity integrity</em>, it is required that every table have a primary key. Neither the PK nor any part of it can contain null&nbsp;values. This is because null&nbsp;values for the primary key mean we cannot identify some rows. For example, in the EMPLOYEE&nbsp;table, Phone cannot be a primary key since some people may not have a telephone.</p> <h3>Referential integrity</h3> <p><em>Referential integrity</em> requires that a foreign key must have a matching primary key or it must be null.&nbsp;This constraint is specified between two tables (parent and child); it maintains the correspondence between rows in these tables.&nbsp; It means the reference from a row in one table to another table must be valid.</p> <p>Examples of referential integrity constraint in the Customer/Order database of the Company<span style="color: #ff0000;"></span>:</p> <ul><li>Customer(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CustID</span></strong>, CustName)</li> <li>Order(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">OrderID</span></strong>, CustID, OrderDate)</li> </ul> <p>To ensure that there are no orphan records, we need to enforce referential integrity.&nbsp;An <em>orphan record</em> is one whose foreign key FK&nbsp;value is not found in the corresponding entity – the entity where the&nbsp;PK&nbsp;is located. Recall that a typical join is between a PK and FK.</p> <p>The referential integrity constraint states that the customer ID (CustID) in the Order table must match a valid CustID in the Customer table. Most relational databases have declarative referential integrity. In other words, when the tables are created the referential integrity constraints are set up.</p> <p>Here is another example from a Course/Class database:</p> <ul><li>Course(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CrsCode</span></strong>, DeptCode, Description)</li> <li>Class(<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CrsCode, Section</span></strong>, ClassTime)</li> </ul> <p>The referential integrity constraint states that CrsCode in the Class table must match a valid CrsCode in the Course table. In this situation, it’s not enough that the CrsCode and Section in the Class table make up the <span style="color: #333333;">PK</span>, we must also enforce referential integrity.</p> <p>When setting up referential integrity it is important that the <span style="color: #333333;">PK and FK </span>have the same data types and come from the same domain, otherwise the<span style="color: #ff0000;">&nbsp;<span style="color: #333333;">relational database management system (RDBMS)</span></span> will not allow the join. RDBMS is a popular database system that is based on the relational model introduced by E. F. Codd of IBM’s San Jose Research Laboratory. Relational database systems are easier to use and understand than other database systems.</p> <h3>Referential integrity in Microsoft Access</h3> <p>In Microsoft (MS) Access, referential integrity is set up by joining the PK in the Customer table to the CustID in the Order table. See Figure 9.1 for a view of how this is done on the Edit Relationships screen in MS Access.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_56" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-56" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the Edit Relationships commend in MS Access." width="300" height="212" class="wp-image-56 size-full" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212-65x45.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Access-Referential-Integrity-Window-300x212-225x159.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-56">Figure 9.1. Referential access in MS Access, by A. Watt.</div></div> <h3>Referential integrity using Transact-SQL (MS SQL Server)</h3> <p>When using Transact-SQL, the referential integrity is set when creating the Order t<span style="color: #333333;">able with the FK</span>. Listed below are the statements showing the FK in the Order table referencing the PK in the Customer table.</p> <div class="textbox">CREATE TABLE Customer<br /> ( CustID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,<br /> CustName CHAR(35) )</div> <div class="textbox">CREATE TABLE Orders<br /> ( OrderID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,<br /> CustID INTEGER REFERENCES Customer(CustID),<br /> OrderDate DATETIME )</div> <h3>Foreign key rules</h3> <p>Additional foreign key rules may be added when setting referential integrity, such as what to do with the child rows (in the Orders table) when the record with the PK, part of&nbsp;the parent (Customer), is deleted or changed (updated). For example, the Edit Relationships window in MS Access (see Figure 9.1) shows two additional options for FK&nbsp;rules: Cascade Update and Cascade Delete. If these are not selected, the system will prevent the deletion or update of PK values in the parent table (Customer table) if a child record exists. The child record is any record with a matching PK.</p> <p>In some databases, an additional option exists when selecting the Delete option called Set to Null. In this is chosen, the PK row is deleted, but the FK in the child table is set to NULL. Though this creates an orphan row, it is acceptable.</p> <h2>Enterprise Constraints</h2> <p>Enterprise constraints – sometimes referred to as semantic constraints&nbsp;–&nbsp;are additional rules specified by users or database administrators and can be based on multiple tables.</p> <p>Here are some examples.</p> <ul><li>A&nbsp;class can have a maximum of 30 students.</li> <li>A teacher can teach a maximum of four&nbsp;classes per semester.</li> <li>An employee cannot take part in more than five&nbsp;projects.</li> <li>The salary of an employee cannot exceed the salary of the employee’s manager.</li> </ul> <h2>Business Rules</h2> <p><em>Business rules</em> are obtained from users when gathering requirements. The requirements-gathering process is very important, and its results should be verified by the user before the database design is built. If the business rules are incorrect, the design will be incorrect, and ultimately the application built will not function as expected by the users.</p> <p>Some examples of business rules are:</p> <ul><li>A teacher can teach many students.</li> <li>A class can have a maximum of 35 students.</li> <li>A course can be taught many times, but by only one instructor.</li> <li>Not all teachers teach classes.</li> </ul> <h3>Cardinality and connectivity</h3> <p>Business rules are used to determine cardinality and connectivity.<em>&nbsp;Cardinality</em>&nbsp;describes the relationship between two data tables by expressing the minimum and maximum number of entity occurrences associated with one occurrence of a related entity. In Figure 9.2, you can see that cardinality is represented by the innermost markings on the relationship symbol. In this figure, the cardinality is 0 (zero) on the right and 1 (one) on the left.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_57" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-57" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202.jpg" alt="Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202" width="300" height="202" class="wp-image-57 size-full" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202-65x43.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Connectivity-and-Cardinality-300x202-225x151.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-57">Figure 9.2.

Essentially, &nbsp;<em>functional dependencies</em> describe how individual attributes are related. FDs are a kind of constraint among attributes within a relation and contribute to a good relational schema design. In this chapter, we will look at:</p> <ul><li>The basic theory and definition of functional dependency</li> <li>The methodology for improving schema designs, also called normalization</li> </ul> <h2>Relational Design and Redundancy</h2> <p>Generally, a good relational database design must capture all of the necessary attributes and associations. The design should do this with a minimal amount of stored information and no redundant data.</p> <p>In database design, redundancy is generally undesirable because it causes problems maintaining consistency after updates. However, redundancy can sometimes lead to performance improvements;&nbsp;for example,&nbsp;when redundancy can be used in place of&nbsp;a <em>join</em> to connect data. A <em>join</em> is used when you need to obtain information based on two related tables.</p> <p>Consider Figure 10.1: &nbsp;customer 1313131 is displayed twice, once for account no. A-101 and again for account A-102. In this case, the customer number is not redundant, although there are deletion anomalies with the table. Having a separate customer table would solve this problem. However, if a branch address were to change, it would have to be updated in multiple places. If the customer number was left in the table as is, then you wouldn’t need a branch table and no join would be required, and performance is improved .&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;"></span></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_72" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-72" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197.jpg" alt="Bank-Accounts-1-300x197" width="300" height="197" class="wp-image-72 size-full" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197-65x42.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Bank-Accounts-1-300x197-225x147.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-72">Figure 10.1.

However, it is difficult to separate the normalization process from the ER modelling process so the two techniques should be used concurrently.</p> <p>Use an entity relation diagram (ERD) to provide the big picture, or macro view, of an organization’s data requirements and operations. This is created through an iterative process that involves identifying relevant entities, their attributes and their relationships.</p> <p>Normalization procedure focuses on characteristics of specific entities and represents the micro view of entities within the ERD.</p> <h2>What Is Normalization?</h2> <p><em>Normalization</em> is the branch of relational theory that provides design insights. It is the process of determining how much redundancy exists in a table. The goals of normalization are to:</p> <ul><li>Be able to characterize the level of redundancy in a relational schema</li> <li>Provide mechanisms for transforming schemas in order to remove redundancy</li> </ul> <p>Normalization theory draws heavily on the theory of functional dependencies. Normalization theory defines six normal forms (NF). Each normal form involves a set of dependency properties that a schema must satisfy and each normal form&nbsp;gives guarantees about the presence and/or absence of update anomalies. This means that higher normal forms have less redundancy, and as a result, fewer update problems.</p> <h2>Normal Forms</h2> <p>All the tables in any database can be in one of the normal forms we will discuss next.&nbsp; Ideally we only want minimal redundancy for PK to FK. Everything else should be derived from other tables.&nbsp; There are six normal forms, but we will only look at the first four, which are:</p> <ul><li>First&nbsp;normal form (1NF)</li> <li>Second&nbsp;normal form (2NF)</li> <li>Third normal form (3NF)</li> <li>Boyce-Codd normal form (BCNF)</li> </ul> <p>BCNF is rarely used.</p> <h2>First Normal Form (1NF)</h2> <p>In the <em>first normal form</em>, only single values are permitted at the intersection of each row and column; hence, there are no repeating groups.</p> <p>To normalize a relation that contains a repeating group, remove the repeating group and form two new relations.</p> <p>The PK&nbsp;of the new relation is a combination of the PK&nbsp;of the original relation plus an attribute from the newly created relation for unique identification.</p> <h3>Process for 1NF</h3> <p>We will use the <strong>Student_Grade_Report&nbsp;</strong>table below,&nbsp;from a School database, as our example to explain the process for 1NF.</p> <div class="textbox"><strong>Student_Grade_Report&nbsp;</strong>(StudentNo, StudentName, Major, CourseNo, CourseName, InstructorNo, InstructorName, InstructorLocation, Grade)</div> <ul><li>In the Student Grade Report table, the repeating group is the course information.

In this case, it’s the course information for each student.</li> <li>Identify the PK for your new table.</li> <li>The PK must uniquely identify the attribute value (StudentNo and CourseNo).</li> <li>After removing all the attributes related to the course and student, you are left with the student course table (<strong>StudentCourse</strong>).</li> <li>The Student table (<strong>Student</strong>) is now in first normal form with the repeating group removed.</li> <li>The two new tables are shown below.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox"><strong>Student</strong> (StudentNo, StudentName, Major)</div> <div class="textbox"><strong>StudentCourse</strong> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">StudentNo, CourseNo</span>,&nbsp;CourseName, InstructorNo, InstructorName, InstructorLocation, Grade)</div> <h3>How to update 1NF anomalies</h3> <p><strong>StudentCourse</strong> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">StudentNo, CourseNo</span>, CourseName, InstructorNo, InstructorName, InstructorLocation, Grade)</p> <ul><li>To add a new course, we need a student.</li> <li>When course information needs to be updated, we may have inconsistencies.</li> <li>To delete a <em>student,</em> we might also delete critical information about a course.</li> </ul> <h2>Second Normal Form (2NF)</h2> <p>For the <em>second normal form</em>, the relation must first be in 1NF. The relation is automatically in 2NF if, and only if, the PK comprises a single attribute.</p> <p>If the relation has a composite PK, then each non-key attribute must be fully dependent on the entire PK and not on a subset of the PK (i.e., there must be no partial dependency or augmentation).</p> <h3>Process for 2NF</h3> <p>To move to 2NF, a table must first be in 1NF.</p> <ul><li>The Student table is already in 2NF because it has a single-column PK.</li> <li>When examining the Student Course table, we see that not all the attributes are fully dependent on the PK; specifically, all course information.

Also all transitive dependencies must be removed; a non-key attribute may not be functionally dependent on another non-key attribute.</p> <h3>Process for 3NF</h3> <ul><li>Eliminate all dependent attributes in transitive relationship(s) from each of the tables that have a transitive relationship.</li> <li>Create new table(s) with removed dependency.</li> <li>Check new table(s) as well as table(s) modified to make sure that each table has a determinant and that no table contains inappropriate dependencies.</li> <li>See the four new tables below.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox"><strong>Student</strong> (StudentNo, StudentName, Major)</div> <div class="textbox"><strong>CourseGrade</strong> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">StudentNo, CourseNo</span>, Grade)</div> <div class="textbox"><strong>Course</strong> (<span style="text-decoration: underline;">CourseNo</span>, CourseName, InstructorNo)</div> <div class="textbox"><strong>Instructor</strong> (InstructorNo, InstructorName, InstructorLocation)</div> <p>At this stage, there should be no anomalies in third normal <span style="color: #333333;">form.

The collection of these steps is sometimes referred to as the&nbsp;<em>software development life cycle (SDLC)</em>. The software product moves through this life cycle (sometimes repeatedly as it is refined or redeveloped) until it is finally retired from use. Ideally, each phase in the life cycle can be checked for correctness before moving on to the next phase.</p> <h2>Software Development Life Cycle – Waterfall</h2> <p>Let us start with an overview of the <em>waterfall model</em> such as you will find in most software engineering textbooks. This waterfall figure, seen in Figure 13.1, illustrates a general waterfall model that could apply to any computer system development. It shows the process as a strict sequence of steps where the output of one step is the input to the next and all of one step has to be completed before moving onto the next.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_91" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-91" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296.jpg" alt="SDLC-300x296" class="wp-image-91 size-full" height="296" width="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296-65x64.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-300x296-225x222.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-91">Figure 13.1. Waterfall model.</div></div> <p>We can use the <em>waterfall process</em> as a means of identifying the tasks that are required, together with the input and output for each activity. What is important is the scope of the activities, which can be summarized as follows:</p> <ul><li><em>Establishing requirements</em> involves consultation with, and agreement among, stakeholders about what they want from a system, expressed as a statement of requirements.</li> <li><em>Analysis</em> starts by considering the statement of requirements and finishes by producing a system specification. The specification is a formal representation of what a system should do, expressed in terms that are independent of how it may be realized.</li> <li><em>Design</em> begins with a system specification, produces design documents and provides a detailed description of how a system should be constructed.</li> <li><em>Implementation</em> is the construction of a computer system according to a given design document and taking into account the environment in which the system will be operating (e.g., specific hardware or software available for the development). Implementation may be staged, usually with an initial system that can be validated and tested before a final system is released for use.</li> <li><em>Testing</em> compares the implemented system against the design documents and requirements specification and produces an acceptance report or, more usually, a list of errors and bugs that require a review of the analysis, design and implementation processes to correct (testing is usually the task that leads to the waterfall model iterating through the life cycle).</li> <li><em>Maintenance</em> involves dealing with changes in the requirements or the implementation environment, bug fixing or porting of the system to new environments (e.g., migrating a system from a standalone PC to a UNIX workstation or a networked environment). Since maintenance involves the analysis of the changes required, design of a solution, implementation and testing of that solution over the lifetime of a maintained software system, the waterfall life cycle will be repeatedly revisited.</li> </ul> <h2>Database Life Cycle</h2> <p>We can use the waterfall cycle as the basis for a model of database development that incorporates three assumptions:</p> <ol><li>We can separate the development of a database – that is, specification and creation of a schema to define data in a database – from the user processes that make use of the database.</li> <li>We can use the three-schema architecture as a basis for distinguishing the activities associated with a schema.</li> <li>We can represent the constraints to enforce the semantics of the data once within a database, rather than within every user process that uses the data.</li> </ol> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_92" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-92" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295.jpg" alt="SDLC-Database-300x295" class="wp-image-92 size-full" height="295" width="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295-65x63.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/SDLC-Database-300x295-225x221.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-92">Figure 13.2. A waterfall model of the activities and their outputs for database development.</div></div> <p>Using these assumptions and Figure 13.2, we can see that this&nbsp;diagram represents a model of the activities and their outputs for database development. It is applicable to any class of DBMS, not just a relational approach.</p> <p>Database application development is the process of obtaining real-world requirements, analyzing requirements, designing the data and functions of the system, and then implementing the operations in the system.</p> <h2>Requirements Gathering</h2> <p>The first step is <em>requirements gathering</em>. During this step, the database designers have to interview the customers (database users) to understand the proposed system and obtain and document the data and functional requirements. The result of this step is a document that includes the detailed requirements provided by the users.</p> <p>Establishing requirements involves consultation with, and agreement among, all the users as to what persistent data they want to store along with an agreement as to the meaning and interpretation of the data elements. The data administrator plays a key role in this process as they overview the business, legal and ethical issues within the organization that impact on the data requirements.</p> <p>The <em>data requirements document</em> is used to confirm the understanding of requirements with users. To make sure that it is easily understood, it should not be overly formal or highly encoded. The document should give a concise summary of all users’ requirements – not just a collection of individuals’ requirements – as the intention is to develop a single shared database.</p> <p>The requirements should not describe how the data is to be processed, but rather what the data items are, what attributes they have, what constraints apply and the relationships that hold between the data items.</p> <h2>Analysis</h2> <p>Data analysis begins with the statement of data requirements and then produces a conceptual data model. The aim of analysis is to obtain a detailed description of the data that will suit user requirements so that both high and low level properties of data and their use are dealt with. These include properties such as the possible range of values that can be permitted for attributes (e.g., in the school database example, the student course code, course title and credit points).</p> <p>The conceptual data model provides a shared, formal representation of what is being communicated between clients and developers during database development – it is focused on the data in a database, irrespective of the eventual use of that data in user processes or implementation of the data in specific computer environments. Therefore, a conceptual data model is concerned with the meaning and structure of data, but not with the details affecting how they are implemented.</p> <p>The conceptual data model then is a formal representation of what data a database should contain and the constraints the data must satisfy. This should be expressed in terms that are independent of how the model may be implemented. As a result, analysis focuses on the questions, “What is required?” not “How is it achieved?”</p> <h2>Logical Design</h2> <p>Database design starts with a conceptual data model and produces a specification of a logical schema; this will determine the specific type of database system (network, relational, object-oriented) that is required. The relational representation is still independent of any specific DBMS; it is another conceptual data model.</p> <p>We can use a relational representation of the conceptual data model as input to the logical design process. The output of this stage is a detailed relational specification, the logical schema, of all the tables and constraints needed to satisfy the description of the data in the conceptual data model. It is during this design activity that choices are made as to which tables are most appropriate for representing the data in a database. These choices must take into account various design criteria including, for example, flexibility for change, control of duplication and how best to represent the constraints. It is the tables defined by the logical schema that determine what data are stored and how they may be manipulated in the database.</p> <p>Database designers familiar with relational databases and SQL might be tempted to go directly to implementation after they have produced a conceptual data model. However, such a direct transformation of the relational representation to SQL tables does not necessarily result in a database that has all the desirable properties: completeness, integrity, flexibility, efficiency and usability. A good conceptual data model is an essential first step towards a database with these properties, but that does not mean that the direct transformation to SQL tables automatically produces a good database. This first step will accurately represent the tables and constraints needed to satisfy the conceptual data model description, and so will satisfy the completeness and integrity requirements, but it may be inflexible or offer poor usability. The first design is then flexed to improve the quality of the database design. <em>Flexing</em> is a term that is intended to capture the simultaneous ideas of bending something for a different purpose and weakening aspects of it as it is bent.</p> <p>Figure 13.3 summarizes the iterative (repeated) steps involved in database design, based on the overview given. Its main purpose is to distinguish the general issue of what tables should be used from the detailed definition of the constituent parts of each table – these tables are considered one at a time, although they are not independent of each other. Each iteration that involves a revision of the tables would lead to a new design; collectively they are usually referred to as <em>second-cut designs</em>, even if the process iterates for more than a single loop.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_93" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-93" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217.jpg" alt="Logical-Design-Steps-300x217" class="wp-image-93 size-full" height="217" width="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217-65x47.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Logical-Design-Steps-300x217-225x162.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-93">Figure 13.3. A summary of the iterative steps involved in database design.</div></div> <p>First, for a given conceptual data model, it is not necessary that all the user requirements it represents be satisfied by a single database. There can be various reasons for the development of more than one database, such as the need for independent operation in different locations or departmental control over “their” data. However, if the collection of databases contains duplicated data and users need to access data in more than one database, then there are possible reasons that one database can satisfy multiple requirements, or issues related to data replication and distribution need to be examined.</p> <p>Second, one of the assumptions about database development is that we can separate the development of a database from the development of user processes that make use of it. This is based on the expectation that, once a database has been implemented, all data required by currently identified user processes have been defined and can be accessed; but we also require flexibility to allow us to meet future requirements changes. In developing a database for some applications, it may be possible to predict the common requests that will be presented to the database and so we can optimize our design for the most common requests.</p> <p>Third, at a detailed level, many aspects of database design and implementation depend on the particular DBMS being used. If the choice of DBMS is fixed or made prior to the design task, that choice can be used to determine design criteria rather than waiting until implementation. That is, it is possible to incorporate design decisions for a specific DBMS rather than produce a generic design and then tailor it to the DBMS during implementation.</p> <p>It is not uncommon to find that a single design cannot simultaneously satisfy all the properties of a good database. So it is important that the designer has prioritized these properties (usually using information from the requirements specification); for example, to decide if integrity is more important than efficiency and whether usability is more important than flexibility in a given development.</p> <p>At the end of our design stage, the logical schema will be specified by SQL data definition language (DDL) statements, which describe the database that needs to be implemented to meet the user requirements.</p> <h2>Implementation</h2> <p>Implementation involves the construction of a database according to the specification of a logical schema. This will include the specification of an appropriate storage schema, security enforcement, external schema and so on. Implementation is heavily influenced by the choice of available DBMSs, database tools and operating environment. There are additional tasks beyond simply creating a database schema and implementing the constraints – data must be entered into the tables, issues relating to the users and user processes need to be addressed, and the management activities associated with wider aspects of corporate data management need to be supported. In keeping with the DBMS approach, we want as many of these concerns as possible to be addressed within the DBMS. We look at some of these concerns briefly now.</p> <p>In practice, implementation of the logical schema in a given DBMS requires a very detailed knowledge of the specific features and facilities that the DBMS has to offer. In an ideal world, and in keeping with good software engineering practice, the first stage of implementation would involve matching the design requirements with the best available implementing tools and then using those tools for the implementation. In database terms, this might involve choosing vendor products with DBMS and SQL variants most suited to the database we need to implement. However, we don’t live in an ideal world and more often than not, hardware choice and decisions regarding the DBMS will have been made well in advance of consideration of the database design. Consequently, implementation can involve additional flexing of the design to overcome any software or hardware limitations.</p> <h2>Realizing the Design</h2> <p>After the logical design has been created, we need our database to be created according to the definitions we have produced. For an implementation with a relational DBMS, this will probably involve the use of SQL to create tables and constraints that satisfy the logical schema description and the choice of appropriate storage schema (if the DBMS permits that level of control).</p> <p>One way to achieve this is to write the appropriate SQL DDL statements into a file that can be executed by a DBMS so that there is an independent record, a text file, of the SQL statements defining the database. Another method is to work interactively using a database tool like SQL Server Management Studio or Microsoft Access. Whatever mechanism is used to implement the logical schema, the result is that a database, with tables and constraints, is defined but will contain no data for the user processes.</p> <h2>Populating the Database</h2> <p>After a database has been created, there are two ways of populating the tables – either from existing data or through the use of the user applications developed for the database.</p> <p>For some tables, there may be existing data from another database or data files. For example, in establishing a database for a hospital, you would expect that there are already some records of all the staff that have to be included in the database. Data might also be brought in from an outside agency (address lists are frequently brought in from external companies) or produced during a large data entry task (converting hard-copy manual records into computer files can be done by a data entry agency). In such situations, the simplest approach to populate the database is to use the import and export facilities found in the DBMS.</p> <p>Facilities to import and export data in various standard formats are usually available (these functions are also known in some systems as loading and unloading data). Importing enables a file of data to be copied directly into a table. When data are held in a file format that is not appropriate for using the import function, then it is necessary to prepare an application program that reads in the old data, transforms them as necessary and then inserts them into the database using SQL code specifically produced for that purpose. The transfer of large quantities of existing data into a database is referred to as a <em>bulk load</em>. Bulk loading of data may involve very large quantities of data being loaded, one table at a time so you may find that there are DBMS facilities to postpone constraint checking until the end of the bulk loading.</p> <h2>Guidelines for Developing an ER Diagram</h2> <p><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp; These are general guidelines that will assist in developing a strong basis for the actual database design (the logical model).</p> <ol><li>Document all entities discovered during the information-gathering stage.</li> <li>Document all attributes that belong to each entity. Select candidate and primary keys. Ensure that all non-key attributes for each entity are full-functionally dependent on the primary key.</li> <li>Develop an initial ER diagram and review it with appropriate personnel. (Remember that this is an iterative process.)</li> <li>Create new entities (tables) for multivalued attributes and repeating groups. Incorporate these new entities (tables) in the ER diagram. Review with appropriate personnel.</li> <li>Verify ER modeling by normalizing tables.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Key Terms</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><strong>analysis</strong>: starts by considering the statement of requirements and finishes by producing a system specification<strong>bulk load</strong>: the transfer of large quantities of existing data into a database <p><strong>data requirements document</strong>:used to confirm the understanding of requirements with the user</p> <p><strong>design</strong>: begins with a system specification, produces design documents and provides a detailed description of how a system should be constructed</p> <p><strong>establishing requirements</strong>: involves consultation with, and agreement among,&nbsp;stakeholders as to what they want from a system; expressed as a statement of requirements</p> <p><strong>flexing</strong>:&nbsp;a term that captures the simultaneous ideas of bending something for a different purpose and weakening aspects of it as it is bent</p> <p><strong>implementation</strong>: the construction of a computer system according to a given design document</p> <p><strong>maintenance</strong>: involves dealing with changes in the requirements or the implementation environment, bug fixing or porting of the system to new environments</p> <p><strong>requirements gathering</strong>: a process during which the database designer interviews the database user to understand the proposed system and obtain and document the data and functional requirements</p> <p><strong>second-cut designs</strong>:the collection of iterations that each involves a revision of the tables that lead to a new design</p> <p><strong>software development life cycle (SDLC)</strong>: the&nbsp;series of steps involved in the database development process</p> <p><strong>testing</strong>: compares the implemented system against the design documents and requirements specification and produces an acceptance report</p> <p><strong>waterfall model</strong>:&nbsp;shows the database development process as a strict sequence of steps where the output of one step is the input to the next</p> <p><strong>waterfall process</strong>: a means of identifying the tasks required for database development, together with the input and output for each activity (see <em>waterfall model)</em></p> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Exercises</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><ol><li>Describe the waterfall model.

Example of Microsoft SQL Server, by A. Watt.</div></div> <p>In a DBMS, the SQL database language is used to:</p> <ul><li>Create the database and table structures</li> <li>Perform basic data management chores (add, delete and modify)</li> <li>Perform complex queries to transform raw data into useful information</li> </ul> <p>In this chapter, we will focus on using SQL to create the database and table structures, mainly using SQL as a data definition language (<em>DDL</em>). In Chapter 16, we will use SQL as a data manipulation language (<em>DML</em>) to insert, delete, select and update data within the database tables.</p> <h2>Create Database</h2> <p>The major SQL DDL statements are CREATE DATABASE and CREATE/DROP/ALTER TABLE. The SQL statement CREATE is used to create the database and table structures.</p> <p><strong>Example: CREATE DATABASE SW</strong></p> <p>A new database named <strong>SW</strong> is created by the SQL statement CREATE&nbsp; DATABASE SW. Once the database is created, the next step is to create the database tables.</p> <p>The general format for the CREATE TABLE command is:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">CREATE TABLE &lt;tablename&gt;<br /> (<br /> ColumnName, Datatype, Optional Column Constraint,<br /> ColumnName, Datatype, Optional Column Constraint,<br /> Optional table Constraints<br /> );</div> <p>Tablename is the name of the database table such as <strong>Employee</strong>. Each field in the CREATE TABLE has three parts (see above):</p> <ol><li>ColumnName</li> <li>Data type</li> <li>Optional Column Constraint</li> </ol> <h3>ColumnName</h3> <p>The ColumnName must be unique within the table. Some examples of ColumnNames are FirstName and LastName.</p> <h2>Data Type</h2> <p>The data type, as described below, must be a system data type or a user-defined data type.&nbsp;Many of the data types have a size such as CHAR(35) or Numeric(8,2).</p> <p><b>Bit</b> <b>–</b>Integer data with either a 1 or 0 value</p> <p><b>Int –</b>Integer (whole number) data from -2^31 (-2,147,483,648) through 2^31 – 1&nbsp; (2,147,483,647)</p> <p><b>Smallint –</b>Integer data from 2^15 (-32,768) through 2^15 – 1 (32,767)</p> <p><b>Tinyint</b> <b>–</b>Integer data from 0 through 255</p> <p><b>Decimal –</b>Fixed precision and scale numeric data from -10^38 -1 through 10^38</p> <p><b>Numeric –</b>A synonym for <b>decimal</b></p> <p><b>Timestamp –</b>A database-wide unique number</p> <p><b>Uniqueidentifier –</b>A globally unique identifier (GUID)</p> <p><b>Money </b>– Monetary data values from -2^63 (-922,337,203,685,477.5808) through 2^63 – 1 (+922,337,203,685,477.5807), with accuracy to one-ten-thousandth of a monetary unit</p> <p><b>Smallmoney –</b>Monetary data values from -214,748.3648 through +214,748.3647, with accuracy to one-ten-thousandth of a monetary unit</p> <p><b>Float –</b>Floating precision number data from -1.79E + 308 through 1.79E + 308</p> <p><b>Real –</b>Floating precision number data from -3.40E + 38 through 3.40E + 38</p> <p><b>Datetime –</b>Date and time data from January 1, 1753, to December 31, 9999, with an accuracy of one-three-hundredths of a second, or 3.33 milliseconds</p> <p><b>Smalldatetime –</b>Date and time data from January 1, 1900, through June 6, 2079, with an accuracy of one minute</p> <p><b>Char –</b>Fixed-length non-Unicode character data with a maximum length of 8,000 characters</p> <p><b>Varchar –</b>Variable-length non-Unicode data with a maximum of 8,000 characters</p> <p><b>Text –</b>Variable-length non-Unicode data with a maximum length of 2^31 – 1 (2,147,483,647) characters</p> <p><b>Binary –</b>Fixed-length binary data with a maximum length of 8,000 bytes</p> <p><b>Varbinary –</b>Variable-length binary data with a maximum length of 8,000 bytes</p> <p><b>Image </b><b>–</b> <b></b>Variable-length binary data with a maximum length of 2^31 – 1 (2,147,483,647) bytes</p> <h2>Optional Column Constraints</h2> <p>The Optional ColumnConstraints are NULL, NOT NULL, UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY and DEFAULT, used to initialize a value for a new record. The column constraint NULL indicates that null values are allowed, which means that a row can be created without a value for this column. The column constraint NOT NULL indicates that a value must be supplied when a new row is created.</p> <p>To illustrate, we will use the SQL statement CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES to create the employees table with 16 attributes or fields.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">USE SW<br /> CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES<br /> (<br /> EmployeeNo&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(10)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; UNIQUE,<br /> DepartmentName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(30)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DEFAULT “Human Resources”,<br /> FirstName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(25)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> LastName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(25)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> Category&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(20)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> HourlyRate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CURRENCY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> TimeCard&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOGICAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> HourlySalaried&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> EmpType&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> Terminated&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; LOGICAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> ExemptCode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> Supervisor&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; LOGICAL&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> SupervisorName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(50)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> BirthDate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DATE&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> CollegeDegree&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CHAR(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> CONSTRAINT &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Employee_PK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeNo<br /> );</div> <p>The first field is EmployeeNo with a field type of CHAR.

After all the table columns are defined, a table constraint, identified by the word CONSTRAINT, is used to create the primary key:</p> <div class="textbox">CONSTRAINT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; EmployeePK&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; PRIMARY KEY(EmployeeNo)</div> <p>We will discuss the constraint property further later in this chapter.</p> <p>Likewise, we can create a Department&nbsp; table,&nbsp; a Project table and an Assignment table using the CREATE TABLE SQL DDL command as shown in the below example.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">USE SW<br /> CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT<br /> (<br /> DepartmentName Char(35)&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> BudgetCode&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Char(30)&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> OfficeNumber&nbsp;&nbsp; Char(15)&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> Phone&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Char(15)&nbsp; NOT NULL,<br /> CONSTRAINT DEPARTMENT_PK PRIMARY KEY(DepartmentName)<br /> );</div> <p>In this example, a project table is created with seven fields: ProjectID, ProjectName, Department, MaxHours, StartDate, and EndDate.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">USE SW<br /> CREATE TABLE PROJECT<br /> (<br /> ProjectID&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Int&nbsp; NOT NULL IDENTITY (1000,100),<br /> ProjectName&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Char(50) NOT NULL,<br /> Department&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Char(35) NOT NULL,<br /> MaxHours&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Numeric(8,2)&nbsp; NOT NULL DEFAULT 100,<br /> StartDate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DateTime NULL,<br /> EndDate&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; DateTime NULL,<br /> CONSTRAINT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ASSIGNMENT_PK&nbsp; PRIMARY KEY(ProjectID)<br /> );</div> <p>In this last example, an assignment table is created with three fields: ProjectID, EmployeeNumber, and HoursWorked.

Identity columns are often used with the PRIMARY KEY constraints to serve as the unique row identifier for the table.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-chapter-sql-dml" title="Chapter 16 SQL Data Manipulation Language"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">16</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 16 SQL Data Manipulation Language</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">Adrienne Watt &#038; Nelson Eng</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p style="text-align: left; text-align: center;">The SQL data manipulation language (DML) is used to query and modify database data. In this chapter, we will describe how to use the SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE&nbsp;SQL DML command statements, defined below.</p> <ul><li><em>SELECT</em>&nbsp; – to query data in the database</li> <li><em>INSERT</em>&nbsp; – to insert data into a table</li> <li><em>UPDATE</em>&nbsp;– to update data in a table</li> <li><em>DELETE</em>&nbsp;– to delete data from a table</li> </ul> <p>In the SQL DML statement:</p> <ul><li>Each clause in a statement should begin on a new line.</li> <li>The beginning of each clause should line up with the beginning of other clauses.</li> <li>If a clause has several parts, they should appear on separate lines and be indented under the start of the clause to show the relationship.</li> <li>Upper case letters are used to represent reserved words.</li> <li>Lower case letters are used to represent user-defined words.</li> </ul> <h1>SELECT Statement</h1> <p>The SELECT statement, or command, allows the user to extract data from tables, based on specific criteria. It&nbsp;is processed according to the following sequence:</p> <p>SELECT DISTINCT item(s)<br /> FROM&nbsp; table(s)<br /> WHERE&nbsp; predicate<br /> GROUP BY&nbsp; field(s)<br /> ORDER BY fields</p> <p>We can use the SELECT&nbsp;statement to generate an employee phone list from the Employees table as follows:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT &nbsp;FirstName, LastName, phone<br /> FROM Employees<br /> ORDER BY LastName</div> <p><span style="color: #333333;">This action will</span> display employee’s last name, first name, and phone number from the Employees table, seen in Table 16.1.</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Last Name</strong></td> <td><strong>First Name</strong></td> <td><strong>Phone Number</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Hagans</td> <td>Jim</td> <td>604-232-3232</td> </tr> <tr><td>Wong</td> <td>Bruce</td> <td>604-244-2322</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 16.1. Employees table.</em></p> <p>In this next example, we will use a Publishers table (Table 16.2). (You will notice that Canada is mispelled in the <em>Publisher Country</em> field for Example Publishing and ABC Publishing.&nbsp;To correct mispelling, use the UPDATE statement to standardize the country field to Canada – see UPDATE statement later in this chapter.)</p> <table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Publisher Name</strong></td> <td><strong>Publisher City</strong></td> <td><strong>Publisher Province</strong></td> <td><strong>Publisher Country</strong></td> </tr> <tr><td>Acme Publishing</td> <td>Vancouver</td> <td>BC</td> <td>Canada</td> </tr> <tr><td>Example Publishing</td> <td>Edmonton</td> <td>AB</td> <td>Cnada</td> </tr> <tr><td>ABC Publishing</td> <td>Toronto</td> <td>ON</td> <td>Canda</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 16.2. Publishers table.</em></p> <p>If you add the publisher’s name and city, you would use the SELECT statement followed by the fields name separated by a comma:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT PubName, city<br /> FROM Publishers</div> <p>This action will display the publisher’s name and city from the Publishers table.</p> <p><span style="color: #333333;">If you just want the publisher’s name under the display name city, you would use the SELECT statement with <em>no comma</em> separating pub_name and city:</span></p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT&nbsp;PubName city<br /> FROM Publishers</div> <p>Performing this action will display only the pub_name from the Publishers table with a “city” heading. &nbsp;If you do not include the comma, SQL Server assumes you want a new column name for pub_name.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <h2>SELECT statement with WHERE criteria</h2> <p>Sometimes you might want to focus on a portion of the Publishers table, such as only publishers that are in Vancouver. In this situation, you would use the SELECT statement with the WHERE criterion, i.e., WHERE city = ‘Vancouver’.</p> <p>These first two examples illustrate&nbsp;how to limit record&nbsp;selection&nbsp;with the WHERE criterion&nbsp;using BETWEEN. Each of these examples give the same results for store items with between 20 and 50 items in stock.</p> <p>Example #1 uses the quantity, <em>qty BETWEEN 20 and 50</em>.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT StorID, qty, TitleID<br /> FROM Sales<br /> WHERE qty BETWEEN 20 and 50&nbsp; <i>(includes the 20 and 50)</i></div> <p>Example #2, on the other hand, uses <em>qty &gt;=20 and qty &lt;=50</em>&nbsp;.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT StorID, qty, TitleID<br /> FROM Sales<br /> WHERE qty &gt;= 20 and qty&nbsp; &lt;= 50</div> <p><span style="color: #333333;">Example #3 illustrates how to limit record selection with the WHERE criterion using NOT BETWEEN.</span></p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT StorID, qty, TitleID<br /> FROM Sales<br /> WHERE qty NOT BETWEEN 20 and 50</div> <p>The next two examples show two different ways&nbsp;to limit record&nbsp;selection&nbsp;with the WHERE criterion using IN, with each yielding the same results.</p> <p>Example #4 shows how to select records using<em>&nbsp;province= </em>as part of the WHERE statement.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT *<br /> FROM Publishers<br /> WHERE province = ‘BC’ OR province = ‘AB’ OR province = ‘ON’</div> <p>Example #5 select records using <em>province IN</em> as part of the WHERE statement.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT *<br /> FROM Publishers<br /> WHERE province IN (‘BC’, ‘AB’, ‘ON’)</div> <p>The final two examples illustrate how NULL and NOT NULL can be used to select records. For these examples, a Books&nbsp;table (not shown) would be used that contains fields called Title, Quantity, and Price (of book). Each publisher has a Books&nbsp;table that lists all of its books.</p> <p><span style="color: #333333;">Example #6 uses NULL.</span></p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT price, title<br /> FROM Books<br /> WHERE price IS NULL</div> <p>Example #7 uses NOT NULL.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT price, title<br /> FROM Books<br /> WHERE price IS NOT NULL</div> <h2><span style="color: #333333;">Using wildcards in the LIKE&nbsp;clause</span></h2> <p>The LIKE keyword selects rows containing fields that match specified portions of character strings. LIKE is used with char, varchar, text, datetime and smalldatetime data. A <em>wildcard&nbsp;</em>allows the user to match fields that contain certain letters. For example, the wildcard province = ‘N%’ would give all provinces that start with the letter ‘N’. Table 16.3 shows four ways to specify wildcards in the SELECT statement in regular express format.</p> <table style="width: 622px; border-spacing: 0px;" cellpadding="0"><tbody><tr><td valign="top" style="width: 105px;"><p style="text-align: center;">%</p> </td> <td style="text-align: left; width: 517px;" valign="top">Any string of zero or more characters</td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top" style="width: 105px;"><p style="text-align: center;">_</p> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 517px;">Any single character</td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top" style="width: 105px;"><p style="text-align: center;">[ ]</p> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 517px;">Any single character within the specified range (e.g., [a-f]) or set (e.g., [abcdef])</td> </tr> <tr><td valign="top" style="width: 105px;"><p style="text-align: center;">[^]</p> </td> <td valign="top" style="width: 517px;">Any single character not within the specified range (e.g., [^a – f]) or set (e.g., [^abcdef])</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p><em>Table 16.3. How to specify wildcards in the SELECT statement.</em></p> <p>In example #1,&nbsp;LIKE ‘Mc%’ searches for all last names that begin with the letters “Mc” (e.g., McBadden).</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT LastName<br /> FROM Employees<br /> WHERE LastName&nbsp;LIKE ‘Mc%’</div> <p>For example #2: LIKE ‘%inger’ searches for all last names that end with the letters “inger” (e.g., Ringer, Stringer).</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT&nbsp;LastName<br /> FROM Employees<br /> WHERE LastName&nbsp;LIKE ‘%inger’</div> <p>In, example #3: LIKE ‘%en%’ searches for all last names that have the letters “en” (e.g., Bennett, Green, McBadden).</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT&nbsp;LastName<br /> FROM Employees<br /> WHERE LastName LIKE ‘%en%’</div> <h2>SELECT statement with ORDER BY&nbsp;clause</h2> <p>You use the ORDER BY&nbsp;clause to sort the records in the resulting list. Use&nbsp;<em>ASC&nbsp;</em>to sort the&nbsp;results&nbsp;in ascending order and <em>DESC&nbsp;</em>to sort the results&nbsp;in descending order.</p> <p>For example, with ASC:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT *<br /> FROM Employees<br /> ORDER BY HireDate ASC</div> <p>And with DESC:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT *<br /> FROM Books<br /> ORDER B<span style="color: #000000;">Y type, pric</span>e DESC</div> <h2>SELECT&nbsp;statement with GROUP BY&nbsp;clause</h2> <p>The <em>GROUP BY&nbsp;</em>clause is used to create one output row per each group and produces summary values for the selected columns, as shown below.</p> <div class="textbox">SELECT type<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <p>Here is an example using the above statement.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT type AS ‘Type’, MIN(price) AS ‘Minimum Price’<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> WHERE royalty &gt; 10<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <p>If the SELECT statement includes a WHERE criterion where <em>price is not null</em>,</p> <div class="textbox">SELECT type, price<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> WHERE price is not null</div> <p>then a statement with the GROUP BY clause would look like this:</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT type AS ‘Type’, MIN(price) AS ‘Minimum Price’<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> WHERE price is not null<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <h3>Using COUNT with GROUP BY</h3> <p>We can use COUNT to tally how many items are in a container. However, if we want to count different items into separate groups, such as marbles of varying colours, then we would use the COUNT function with the GROUP BY command.</p> <p>The below SELECT statement illustrates how to count groups of data using the COUNT function with the GROUP BY clause.</p> <div class="textbox">SELECT COUNT(*)<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <h3>Using AVG and SUM with GROUP BY</h3> <p>We can use the AVG function to give us the average of any group, and SUM to give the total.</p> <p>Example #1 uses the AVG FUNCTION with the GROUP BY type.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT AVG(qty)<br /> FROM&nbsp;Books<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <p>Example #2 uses the SUM function with the GROUP BY type.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT SUM(qty)<br /> FROM Books<br /> GROUP BY type</div> <p>Example #3 uses both the AVG and SUM functions with the GROUP BY type in the SELECT statement.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT ‘Total Sales’ = SUM(qty), ‘Average Sales’ = AVG(qty), stor_id<br /> FROM Sales<br /> GROUP BY StorID ORDER BY&nbsp; ‘Total Sales’</div> <h2>Restricting rows with HAVING</h2> <p>The HAVING clause can be used to restrict rows. It is similar to the WHERE condition except HAVING&nbsp;can include the aggregate function; the WHERE cannot do this.</p> <p>The HAVING clause behaves like the WHERE clause, but is applicable to groups. In this example, we use the HAVING clause to exclude the groups with the province ‘BC’.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SELECT au_fname AS ‘Author”s First Name’, province as ‘Province’<br /> FROM Authors<br /> GROUP BY au_fname, province<br /> HAVING province &lt;&gt; ‘BC’</div> <h2>INSERT statement</h2> <p>The <em>INSERT statement</em> adds rows to a table. In addition,</p> <ul><li>INSERT specifies the table or view that data will be inserted into.</li> <li>Column_list lists columns that will be affected by the INSERT.</li> <li>If a column is omitted, each value must be provided.</li> <li>If you are including columns, they can be listed in any order.</li> <li>VALUES specifies the data that you want to insert into the table.&nbsp;VALUES is required.</li> <li>Columns with the IDENTITY property should not be explicitly listed in the column_list or values_clause.</li> </ul> <p>The syntax for the INSERT statement is:</p> <div class="textbox">INSERT [INTO] Table_name | view name [column_list]<br /> DEFAULT VALUES | values_list | select statement</div> <p>When inserting rows with the INSERT statement, these rules apply:</p> <ul><li>Inserting an empty string (‘ ‘) into a varchar or text column inserts a single space.</li> <li>All char columns are&nbsp;right-padded to the defined length.</li> <li>All trailing spaces are removed&nbsp;from data inserted into varchar columns, except in strings that contain&nbsp;only spaces. These strings are truncated to a single space.</li> <li>If an INSERT statement violates a constraint, default or rule, or if it is the wrong data type, the&nbsp;statement fails and SQL Server displays an error message.</li> </ul> <p>When you specify values for only some of the columns in the column_list, one of three things can happen to the columns that have no values:</p> <ol><li>A default value is entered if&nbsp;the column has a DEFAULT constraint, if a default is bound to the column, or if a default is bound to the underlying user-defined data type.</li> <li>NULL is entered if the column allows NULLs and no default value exists for the column.</li> <li>An error message is displayed&nbsp;and the row is rejected if the column is defined as NOT NULL and no&nbsp;default exists.</li> </ol> <p>This example uses INSERT to add a record to the publisher’s Authors table.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">INSERT INTO Authors<br /> VALUES(‘555-093-467’, ‘Martin’, ‘April’, ‘281 555-5673’, ‘816 Market St.,’ , ‘Vancouver’, ‘BC’, ‘V7G3P4’, 0)</div> <p>This following example illustrates how to insert a partial row into the Publishers table with a column list. The country column had a default value of Canada so it does not require that you include it in your values.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">INSERT INTO Publishers&nbsp;(PubID, PubName, city, province)<br /> VALUES (‘9900’, ‘Acme Publishing’, ‘Vancouver’, ‘BC’)</div> <p>To insert rows into a table with an IDENTITY column, follow the below example.&nbsp;Do not supply the value for the IDENTITY nor the name of the column in the column list.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">INSERT INTO jobs<br /> VALUES (‘DBA’, 100, 175)</div> <h3>Inserting specific values into an IDENTITY column</h3> <p>By default, data cannot be inserted directly into an IDENTITY column; however, if a row is accidentally deleted, or there are gaps in the IDENTITY column values, you can insert a row and specify the IDENTITY column value.</p> <div class="textbox">IDENTITY_INSERT option</div> <p>To allow an insert with a specific identity value, the IDENTITY_INSERT option can be used as follows.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">SET IDENTITY_INSERT jobs ON<br /> INSERT INTO jobs &nbsp;(job_id, job_desc, min_lvl, max_lvl)<br /> VALUES (19, ’DBA2’, 100, 175)<br /> SET IDENTITY_INSERT jobs OFF</div> <h3>&nbsp;Inserting rows with a SELECT&nbsp;statement</h3> <p>We can sometimes create a small temporary table from a large table. For this, we can insert rows with a SELECT statement. When using this command, there is no validation for uniqueness. Consequently, there may be many rows with the same pub_id in the example below.</p> <p>This example creates a smaller temporary Publishers table using the CREATE TABLE statement. Then the INSERT with a SELECT statement is used to add records to this temporary Publishers table from the publis table.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">CREATE TABLE dbo.tmpPublishers (<br /> PubID char (4) NOT NULL ,<br /> PubName varchar (40) NULL ,<br /> city varchar (20) NULL ,<br /> province char (2) NULL ,<br /> country varchar (30) NULL&nbsp; DEFAULT (‘Canada’)<br /> )<br /> INSERT&nbsp; tmpPublishers<br /> SELECT * FROM Publishers</div> <p>In this example, we’re copying a subset of data.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">INSERT tmpPublishers (pub_id, pub_name)<br /> SELECT PubID, PubName<br /> FROM Publishers</div> <p>In this example, the publishers’ data are copied to the tmpPublishers table and the country column is set to Canada.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">INSERT tmpPublishers (PubID, PubName, city, province, country)<br /> SELECT PubID, PubName, city, province, ‘Canada’<br /> FROM Publishers</div> <h2>UPDATE statement</h2> <p>The <em>UPDATE&nbsp;statement</em> changes data in existing rows either by adding new data or modifying existing data.</p> <p>This example uses the UPDATE statement to standardize the country field to be Canada for all records in the Publishers table.</p> <div class="textbox">UPDATE Publishers<br /> SET country = ‘Canada’</div> <p>This example increases the royalty amount by 10% for those royalty amounts between 10 and 20.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">UPDATE roysched<br /> SET royalty = royalty + (royalty * .10)<br /> WHERE royalty BETWEEN 10 and 20</div> <h3>Including subqueries in an UPDATE statement</h3> <p>The employees from the Employees table who were hired by the publisher in 2010 are given a promotion to the highest job level for their job type. This is what the UPDATE statement would look like.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">UPDATE Employees<br /> SET job_lvl =<br /> (SELECT max_lvl FROM jobs<br /> WHERE employee.job_id = jobs.job_id)<br /> WHERE DATEPART(year, employee.hire_date) = 2010</div> <h2>DELETE&nbsp;statement</h2> <p>The <em>DELETE&nbsp;statement</em> removes rows from a record set. DELETE names the table or view that holds the rows that will be deleted and only one table or row may be listed at a time. WHERE is&nbsp; a standard WHERE clause that limits the deletion to select records.</p> <p>The DELETE syntax looks like this.</p> <div class="textbox">DELETE [FROM] {table_name | view_name }<br /> [WHERE clause]</div> <p>The rules for the DELETE statement are:</p> <ol><li>If you omit a WHERE clause, all rows in the table are removed&nbsp;(except for indexes, the table, constraints)<i>.</i></li> <li>DELETE cannot be used with a view that has a FROM clause naming more than one table. (Delete can affect only one base table at a time.)</li> </ol> <p>What follows are three different DELETE statements that can be used.</p> <p>1. Deleting all rows from a table.</p> <div class="textbox">DELETE<br /> FROM Discounts</div> <p>2. Deleting selected rows:</p> <div class="textbox">DELETE<br /> FROM Sales<br /> WHERE stor_id = ‘6380’</div> <p>3. Deleting rows based on a value in a subquery:</p> <div class="textbox">DELETE FROM Sales<br /> WHERE title_id IN<br /> (SELECT title_id FROM Books&nbsp;WHERE type = ‘mod_cook’)</div> <h1>Built-in Functions</h1> <p>There are many built-in functions in SQL Server such as:</p> <ol><li><em>Aggregate:</em>&nbsp;returns summary values</li> <li><em>Conversion:</em>&nbsp;transforms one data type to another</li> <li><em>Date:</em>&nbsp;displays information about dates and times</li> <li><em>Mathematical:</em>&nbsp;performs operations on numeric data</li> <li><em>String:</em>&nbsp;performs operations on character strings, binary data or expressions</li> <li><em>System:</em>&nbsp;returns a special piece of information from the database</li> <li><em>Text and image:</em>&nbsp;performs operations on text and image data</li> </ol> <p>Below you will find detailed descriptions and examples for the first four functions.</p> <h2>Aggregate functions</h2> <p>Aggregate functions perform a calculation on a set of values and return a single, or summary, value.

A student is not required to enroll in any courses at registration; enrollment in a course can happen at a later time.</p> <p>Information recorded for each member of the tutorial and counseling staff must include the staff number, name and region in which he or she is located. Each staff member may act as a counselor to one or more students, and may act as a tutor to one or more students on one or more courses. It may be the case that, at any particular point in time, a member of staff may not be allocated any students to tutor or counsel.</p> <p>Each student has one counselor, allocated at registration, who supports the student throughout his or her university career. A student is allocated a separate tutor for each course in which he or she is enrolled. A staff member may only counsel or tutor a student who is resident in the same region as that staff member.</p> <p>Each course that is available for study must have a course code, a title and a value in terms of credit points. A course is either a 15-point course or a 30-point course. A course may have a quota for the number of students enrolled in it at&nbsp;any one presentation. A course need not have any students enrolled in it (such as a course that has just been written and offered for study).</p> <p>Students are constrained in the number of courses they can be enrolled in at any one time. They may not take courses simultaneously if their combined points total exceeds 180 points.</p> <p>For assessment purposes, a 15-point course may have up to three assignments per presentation and a 30-point course may have up to five assignments per presentation. The grade for an assignment on any course is recorded as a mark out of 100.</p> <p>The university database below is one possible data model that describes the above set of requirements. The model has several parts, beginning with an ERD and followed by a written description of entity types, constraints, and assumptions.</p> <h2>Design Process</h2> <p>See Figure A.1.</p> <ol><li>The first step is to determine the kernels. These are typically nouns: Staff, Course, Student and Assignment.</li> <li>The next step is to document all attributes for each entity. This is where you need to ensure that all tables are properly normalized.</li> <li>Create the initial ERD and review it&nbsp;with the users.</li> <li>Make changes if needed after the ERD review.</li> <li>Verify the ER model with users to finalize the design.</li> </ol> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_96" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-96" style="width: 300px"><a href="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189.jpg" data-url="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189.jpg"><img src="http://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189.jpg" alt="Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189" class="wp-image-96 size-full" height="189" width="300" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189-65x40.jpg 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/dbdesign01/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2013/12/Ch-14-University-Example-ERD-300x189-225x141.jpg 225w" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-96">Figure A.1.
