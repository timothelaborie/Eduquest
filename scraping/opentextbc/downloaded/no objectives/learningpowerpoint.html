Select a template and PowerPoint will format the entire presentation according to that template.</p> <p><em>Steps to choosing a theme template:</em></p> <ol><li>Open PowerPoint.</li> <li>At the PowerPoint window, click the File tab, then click New.</li> <li>The Available Templates and Themes screen will appear, click on an available template or download a free template from the office.com online templates.<img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-170" alt="powerpoint themes" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/themes-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/themes-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/themes-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /></li> <li>Once you have selected the desired template, it will be displayed in normal view. New slides can be added as needed.</li> </ol> <h4>Tips &amp; Tricks</h4> <p>A theme template can be added to a presentation before, during or after you have added the presentation content.</p> <p>To apply various templates to a presentation, click the Design tab, then click on the desired template in the themes group.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-171" alt="theme templates" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/theme_templates3.gif" width="834" height="126" title="" /></p> <h4>Create a New Slide</h4> <p>Whether you are using a pre-made theme template or working from your own design, it is very easy to insert a new slide.</p> <ol><li>In the slide pane click on the slide where you would like the new slide to appear below.</li> <li>Click on the <strong>New Slide</strong> button located on the <strong>Home </strong>tab in the <strong>Slides </strong>group.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-172" alt="new slide button" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/new_slide.gif" width="296" height="150" title="" /></li> <li>The new slide should appear below the selected slide. If you want to add a new slide between two, select the first of the two slides and click <strong>New Slide</strong>.</li> <li>Notice the New Slide button contains a New Slide button arrow. Click on the arrow to view different slide layouts. Another way to change the slide layout is by clicking on the <strong>Layout </strong>button located in the <strong>Slides </strong>group. The slide layout option determines the position of the objects on a slide. Simply click on the layout you want to use and it will appear in the slide pane.<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-173" alt="slide layout" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/slidelayout.gif" width="539" height="478" title="" /></li> </ol> <h4>Create Slide Content</h4> <p>Entering text and images into your presentation slide is easy and fun. When using the theme template the first slide to appear in Normal view is called the <strong>Title Slide</strong>.</p> <p>The title slide is the slide that is used to introduce the presentation to the audience. It has two text placeholders for text: title text placeholder and sub-title text placeholder. <strong></strong>Placeholders are the building blocks for a PowerPoint slide.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-174" alt="place holders" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/placeholders.gif" width="555" height="292" title="" /></p> <p>To insert text in a placeholder, left click inside of the textbox and begin typing. Once you have entered text, click outside the text box to see how your text looks. The placeholder then becomes an object. An <strong>object</strong> is any item on a slide that can be manipulated. Objects are the building blocks that make up a slide. A text object can moved around and repositioned on a slide.</p> <p>A object is selected when there is a gray, bold outline around the object, and when the cursor turns into a cross. Around the selected object are small white circles that are called sizing handles. You can drag the handles to position the object.</p> <p>To apply formatting to text inside an object, select the text with your cursor, then click on the <strong>Home </strong>tab and in the <strong>Font </strong>group add text attributes such as bold, underline, and italics. The <strong>Paragraph </strong>group, located next to the Font group, contains commands that allow you to change the alignment of text, insert numbers or bullets to lists, and indent text.</p> <p>You can also edit your text by accessing the Font dialogue box by clicking the <strong>Font </strong>group dialogue box launcher. (The dialogue box launcher is the small button containing a diagonal arrow that displays in the lower right corner of the group.) The Font dialogue box includes special effects such as: double strikethrough, superscript and subscript.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-175" alt="font menu" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/fontmenu.gif" width="455" height="312" title="" /></p> <p>Another quick and easy way to format slides is by using a slide master. A <strong>Slide Master</strong> will reduce the steps needed to format all the slides in a presentation. Any changes made in the slide master will affect all slides in the presentation. This allows for consistency in any presentation.</p> <p>When you choose a theme template PowerPoint automatically adds a Slide master.

Bulleted lists are used in PowerPoint to display levels of importance within the presentation. Various slide layouts in the Slide Layout task pane contain bullets. To add multi levels to a bulleted list you need to choose the appropriate layout.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-178" alt="bullet list" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/bulletlist-300x187.gif" width="300" height="187" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/bulletlist-300x187.gif 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/bulletlist-1024x640.gif 1024w" title="" /></p> <p>The first-level bullet will be displayed under the title placeholder. Once you have typed your text next to the first-level bullet press <strong>Enter </strong>on your keyboard. The new first-level bullet automatically appears. Press <strong>Tab </strong>on your keyboard and the first-level bullet becomes a second level bullet. Press <strong>Shift + Tab</strong> this will decrease the indent and bring the bullet back to first level.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-180" alt="indent button" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/levellist.gif" width="43" height="23" title="" /></p> <p>Another method to add levels to your presentation is by clicking the decrease list level or increase list level buttons on the <strong>Paragraph </strong>group in the <strong>Home </strong>tab.</p> <p>You can customize the bullets in your presentation by selecting the Bullets and Numbering dialogue box from <strong>Paragraph </strong>group located in the <strong>Home </strong>tab. Select the bullet text, click on the drop down arrow next to Bullets or Numbering, click on <strong>Bullets and Numbering</strong>, then choose the from the pre-designed bullets.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-181" alt="pre-designed bullets" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/bullets2-300x256.gif" width="300" height="256" title="" /></p> <p>Now that you are able to create a presentation let us move on to view and save presentations.</p> </div></div>

Your Windows Explorer will open and allow you to choose an existing presentation. <em>Note: This section is information only, you can work along exploring this feature. Later in this lesson you will use this PowerPoint open in the hands on practice activities.</em></p> <h4><a title="View_a_Presentation" data-url=""></a>View a Presentation</h4> <p>In the first learning activity we learned that there are four buttons located in the <strong>View area</strong> that are used to view a presentation.</p> <p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-184" alt="normal view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/normview1.gif" width="16" height="16" title="" />&nbsp;The first view is the <strong>Normal View</strong>. In this view, you edit one slide at a time by adding text, graphics and clip art. This is the default view. It allows you to see and work with several aspects of the presentation simultaneously, including the slide, the outline/slide sorter section, and the notes pane. There are many ways to navigate from slide to slide in the normal view. First, you can select the slide pane and simply click on the desired slide. Second, you can select the outline tab and click on the slide icon. This will display the selected slide in the slide pane. Another way to view slides in Normal view is by using the arrow keys on your keyboard.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-185" alt="normal view large" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/normalview-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/normalview-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/normalview-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-186" alt="slide sorter button" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/slidesorter1.gif" width="17" height="18" title="" />&nbsp;The second view is the <strong>Slide Sorter View</strong>. This view shows a miniature of your slides and provides an easy way to rearrange or delete one or more slides. Under each slide is the slide number, transition between slides, body text animation and display time. All of these attributes can be modified from this view.</p> <p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-187 aligncenter" alt="slide sorter view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/slidesort.gif" width="407" height="250" title="" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-188" alt="reading pane icon" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/reading-pane-icon.png" width="18" height="24" title="" />&nbsp;The third view is the <strong>Reading View</strong>. This view allows an inpidual to view the presentation in a window with simple controls that make the presentation easy to review on the computer.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-189" alt="reading pane screen" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/reading-pane-screen-1024x613.png" width="1024" height="613" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/reading-pane-screen-1024x613.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/reading-pane-screen-300x179.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/reading-pane-screen.png 1296w" title="" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-190" alt="view icon" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/viewshow.gif" width="15" height="15" title="" />&nbsp;The fourth view is the <strong>Slide Show View</strong>. This view is used to deliver the presentation to an <strong>audience</strong>. With this view, you can see the slide transitions and timing. To run the slide show automatically, timings must be set. Use the arrow keys or your mouse to move from slide to slide. To return to the normal view or the slide sorter view, press the <strong>ESC</strong> key.</p> <h4><a title="View_Options" data-url=""></a>View Options</h4> <p style="text-align: left;">A useful way to view your presentations is in <strong>black and white or Grayscale</strong>. If you need to use a projector that can only handle Black &amp; White or Grayscale you should view your presentation with a black and white command applied to be sure your text and layout is still readable.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">To <strong>see</strong> how your slides would look in black and white, click the <strong>View</strong> tab, select Grayscale or Black and White in the <strong>Color/Grayscale</strong> group and scroll through your slides.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-191" alt="greyscale view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/pureblack-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/pureblack-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/pureblack-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">A new tab will then display. From the <strong>Black and White</strong> tab, select one of the various black and white settings.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-192" alt="black and white view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/blackwhitetab-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/blackwhitetab-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/blackwhitetab-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /></p> <h4>Print a Presentation</h4> <p style="text-align: left;">A presentation can be printed in many formats. You can print the slides of your presentation, handouts for the audience, the notes page, or the outline view. Prior to printing the desired material, you may want to specify the page Orientation; select <strong>Slide Orientation </strong>located in the <strong>Page Setup </strong>group in the <strong>Design </strong>tab. The dialogue box will appear; this allows you to set the orientation either Portrait or Landscape.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The next step to printing your presentation is to display the print dialogue box. Click on the <strong>File </strong>tab, then <strong>Print</strong>. At the Print screen you have the the option to print all of the slides, or you can specify the slides that you would like to print.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br /> <img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-193" alt="specify the slides you want to print" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/printscreen-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/printscreen-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/printscreen-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /><br /> </strong></p> <p style="text-align: left;">The drop list beside <strong>Full Page Slides</strong>: displays a list of printing options such as print slides, handouts, notes pages and outline view.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">The <strong>Color </strong>drop list includes the options to have your presentation print in Color, Grayscale and Pure Black and White.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">Once you have determined how you want your presentation to print, you can then select the number of copies and click OK.</p> <h4><a title="Correct_Text_" data-url=""></a>Correct Text</h4> <p style="text-align: left;">While viewing your presentation, you need to proofread your presentation for any errors. PowerPoint is equipped with a spell checking feature to check for and correct misspelled words. Keep in mind that the spell check only recognizes misspelled words not misused words. To check your presentation for any spelling mistakes, click on the <strong>Spelling </strong>button located in the <strong>Review </strong>tab. When PowerPoint recognizes a misspelled word it offers suggestions, you then have the option to choose the correct spelling or ignore the misspelled word.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-194" alt="spell check view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/spelling1-1024x640.gif" width="1024" height="640" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/spelling1-1024x640.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/spelling1-300x187.gif 300w" title="" /></p> <h4><a title="Save_vs_Save_As" data-url=""></a>Save vs Save As</h4> <p style="text-align: left;">When creating a presentation, you must save your files to a disk. When saving the presentation for the first time, you will use the <strong>Save As </strong>command located under the <strong>File </strong>tab.</p> <p style="text-align: left;">You will then name your presentation and save it either on your hard drive or on a disk. When naming a PowerPoint presentation, you will notice that the new file will be named with the extension .pptx.</p> <p style="text-align: left;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-195" alt="save in a directory" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/savein.gif" width="636" height="397" title="" /></p> <p style="text-align: left;">Once you have saved your presentation with a new name, when you make any additional changes you can use the Save command. The Save command saves any changes you make to the file in the same location you specified when you used the Save As command. Be sure to save your files frequently.</p> <h4><a title="Quit_PowerPoint" data-url=""></a>Quit PowerPoint</h4> <p style="text-align: left;">Once you have saved your PowerPoint Presentation, click on the X located to the right of the Title bar. This command will close the PowerPoint program.</p> </div></div>

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-plan-and-design" title="Plan and Design"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">9</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Plan and Design</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">bpayne</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h3 style="text-align: left;">Unit 2 Plan, Design, Create and Deliver a Presentation</h3> <hr /> <p><em>Remember</em> to check in with your instructor for Discussion or E-mail messages.</p> <p>Before you create a presentation, it is important to <strong>plan</strong> and <strong>outline</strong> the <strong>message</strong> you wish to convey. When working on a construction project, master carpenters abide by the rule “measure twice, cut once.” Likewise, when it comes to creating a presentation, taking the time to plan and prepare before beginning to create a presentation will not only make the presentation more enjoyable and effective but will ultimately save you time. Part of this planning is to identify the audience who will be listening to and/or watching the presentation and then to choose a medium that is appropriate for conveying the message to this audience. The key to being comfortable and relaxed in front of an audience when you deliver the presentation is <strong>preparation</strong>. When the content is organized in a logical manner, it is much easier to learn and to deliver.</p> <h4>Defining the Purpose of the Presentation</h4> <p>There are many different types of presentations. For a presentation to be successful, it is necessary to begin by defining the purpose. Before beginning, ask yourself – Is the presentation meant:</p> <ul><li>to inform?</li> <li>to persuade?</li> <li>to sell?</li> <li>to educate?</li> <li>to motivate?</li> <li>to entertain?</li> </ul> <p>If the presentation is intended to <em><strong>inform</strong> </em>or <em><strong>educate,</strong></em> then the goal of the speaker is to increase the knowledge or ability of the audience by providing new information about an already familiar subject, process, event or concept.</p> <p>If the presentation is intended to <strong><em>persuade, sell,</em></strong> or<strong><em>motivate,</em></strong> then the goal of the speaker is to change the attitude, belief, or behavior of the audience. The speaker may present opposing points of view on a particular subject, product, or issue allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions based on the facts presented; or, the speaker may present and explore a concept or policy concluding with a recommended course of action. This type of presentation can be much more challenging to create and deliver than one meant to inform or educate because it is often based on controversial subjects important not only to the speaker but also to the audience.</p> <p>If the presentation is intended to <em><strong>entertain, </strong></em>then the goal of the speaker is to keep the audience engaged, amused, and interested in the content of the presentation.</p> <p>Identifying the purpose helps to provide a focus for the speaker and ensures that a clear message is conveyed to the audience. Limit the number of related topics in the presentation to avoid confusion in the mind of the audience. Ensure that the main topic is clearly stated and then supported and reinforced throughout the entire presentation.</p> <h4>Developing the Content</h4> <p>To create an effective presentation, you must know your subject. If necessary, you may need to research some components of your topic. Research can enhance your credibility. Knowledge of the latest information in the subject area helps you to anticipate audience reaction and gives you time to prepare ways of dealing with potential controversies. The Internet is one source of current information, as well as traditional forms of media including newspapers and magazines. Personal interviews may also be helpful in developing the content of the presentation.</p> <h4>Creating Effective Text Presentations</h4> <p>Once the purpose has been identified and your topic researched, it is time to organize your presentation. The first slide in the presentation should provide an <strong>introduction</strong> to the topic, and the last slide should provide a <strong>conclusion</strong>. In between, there should be a natural flow to the presentation. Using <strong>PowerPoint</strong>‘<strong>s Outline View</strong> is a very effective way to enter and organize the content of the presentation by arranging it into first, second, and third level headings. Each of these remaining slides in a presentation should contain only one main thought or idea. Too many thoughts or ideas on one slide may confuse the audience and cause the speaker to stray from the topic – don’t overwhelm the audience with too much information. Apply the 7 x 7 rule to the content of these remaining slides. This means that each slide should contain no more than seven lines (bullets) of text and each line of text should contain no more than seven words. This can be achieved by eliminating unnecessary articles, pronouns, and adjectives. Be sure that the grammatical structure of the phrases are parallel to one another and that font sizes are readable.</p> <p>A good <strong>title slide</strong> contains the title and subtitle of the presentation.</p> <p>A good <strong>introductory slide</strong> can build speaker confidence and help a speaker to relax. It should be designed to:</p> <ul><li>gain the attention of the audience</li> <li>introduce the topic</li> <li>forecast the main points</li> </ul> <p>An effective <strong>concluding slide</strong> needs to be more than an opportunity for the speaker to say <strong>thank you.</strong> The <strong>Closing Slide</strong> should:</p> <ul><li>summarize the main points</li> <li>leave the audience with something to remember</li> </ul> <p><strong>Guidelines for slides</strong>:</p> <ul><li>contain only one main idea</li> <li>maintain a consistent layout</li> <li>follow the 7 x 7 rule</li> <li>keep phrases parallel</li> <li>maintain a consistent style for all slides <ul><li>use either capital letters or lowercase letters to start all listed points</li> <li>use the same font sizes for listed points</li> </ul> </li> <li>font size should be no smaller than 24 point font size (with exceptions of axis labels, etc) <ul><li>think about the delivery of the presentation and evaluate the font size for how it will be delivered</li> <li>titles should be 32 point or larger; text should be 24 point</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h4>Before You Begin</h4> <p>You will be assigned a partner to work with this week while you do the practice presentations. You and your partner will review each other’s presentation and offer advice and help (your instructor can also give you some help if you need it). When the partners are assigned, there will also be a Discussion Board set up for the partners to post their practice presentations for review by the partner. You will have the discussion board available for both the presentations and the advice and help for each other. The assignments will be done on your own.</p> <p>The 7 x 7 rule may be the one that needs the most work. Work at eliminating unnecessary articles, pronouns, and adjectives. Creating a list on a slide will often allow you great flexibility on a slide. Point format means that whole sentences are not required.</p> <p>Following the suggestions for planning, preparation and delivery outlined above will put you on your way to creating and delivering an effective presentation.</p> <p>Click the <strong>Next Topic</strong> arrow <strong></strong>to proceed with <strong>Practice Activities.</strong></p> </div></div>

(Note: It is important to be certain that you have the legal right to use clip art, photographs, sounds, and movies in your slide show). You can import files saved in several different formats or add your own graphic or PowerPoint has its own gallery of Microsoft clip art images. To insert a clip art image choose a slide layout that has a content placeholder. Click the Insert Clip Art button in the placeholder.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-207" alt="insert clip art button" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/clipartslide.gif" width="170" height="146" title="" /></p> <p>The Clip Art Task pane displays on the right side of the screen.</p> <p>Enter a word that describes the clip art that you want in the text box labeled “Search for,” and click Go. Graphics that are similar to the word that you entered in the search box will appear in the task pane. Use the scrollbar to browse through available clip art.</p> <p>Click once on the clip art you would like to insert. Your clip art will appear on the current slide, with sizing handles visible and the <strong>Picture Tools Format</strong> tab will open.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-208" alt="picture tools format tab" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/picturetab-1024x116.gif" width="1024" height="116" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/picturetab-1024x116.gif 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/picturetab-300x33.gif 300w" title="" /></p> <p>The Picture Tools Format tab allows for color adjustment, cropping a picture, adding lines around the picture and compressing a picture. By hovering over each command in the available groups, the quick tip screen will appear identifying the command that the icon represents.</p> <p>Around the image, are sizing handles. They allow you to move and resize the image on the slide.</p> <h4><a data-url=""></a>Adjust Clip Art</h4> <p><em><strong>To change the shape of a picture:</strong> </em></p> <p><strong>Step 1:</strong></p> <p>Move your cursor over the picture and click once to select it. You will see a number of small circles appear along the edge of the picture. These circles are called “sizing handles.” There is also one green circle, which is used to rotate the image.</p> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong></p> <p>Click on one of the sizing handles that appears on a side of the picture, hold the mouse button down, and drag the handle to change the shape of the picture. Your pointer will be a double-sided arrow when you are directly over a sizing handle. You are distorting the picture by stretching or squishing it.</p> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong></p> <p>Release the mouse button when you have achieved the desired shape.</p> <p><strong><em>To change the size of a picture</em> </strong>:</p> <p><strong>Step 1</strong>:</p> <p>Move your cursor over the picture and click once. You will see the sizing handles described above.</p> <p><strong>Step 2</strong>:</p> <p>Click your cursor on one of the sizing handles that appear on the corner of the picture. Hold the mouse button down and drag the picture to make it smaller or larger. Using these corner handles maintains the original proportions of the image (it does not stretch or squish).</p> <p><strong>Step 3</strong>:</p> <p>Release the mouse button when you have achieved the desired size.</p> <p>The size of a picture can also be changed by adjusting the aspect ratio which is the relationship between the height and width of an object. To change the aspect ratio of an object right click on the object and select Size and Position. The Size and Position dialogue box will appear. Click on the size tab. Check that the Lock aspect ratio box is selected.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-209" alt="size and position" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/sizeposition.gif" width="351" height="444" title="" /></p> <p><em><strong>To move a picture</strong>:</em></p> <p><strong>Step 1: </strong>Move your cursor over the picture.</p> <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click the mouse button, hold the button down, and drag the picture to change its location.</p> <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Release the mouse button when you are satisfied with the location of the image.</p> <h4><a data-url=""></a>Adding Shapes</h4> <p>By clicking on the <strong>Insert</strong> tab and then <strong>Shapes</strong> in the <strong>Illustrations</strong> group you can draw a variety of shapes, straight lines, free-form lines, or pre-designed shapes and lines.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-210" alt="pre-designed shapes and lines" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/shapes.jpg" width="193" height="500" title="" /></p> <p>Once you have inserted <strong>Shapes </strong>on a slide you can then enhance the shape by adding color to the shape, an outline, an effect, or any of the preset styles available in the <strong>Shape Styles </strong>group located in the <strong>Illustrations </strong>section of the <strong>Insert </strong>Ribbon.</p> <h4><a data-url=""></a>Adding SmartArt</h4> <p>Sometimes when you are working with text the normal text attributes of bold, italics, underline and colour are just not enough to capture the audience’s attention. <strong>SmartArt </strong>allows you to create really dynamic illustrated text! There are 7 basic types of SmartArt to choose from.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-211" alt="smart art graphic" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArt.jpg" width="729" height="377" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArt.jpg 729w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArt-300x155.jpg 300w" title="" /></p> <p>When you choose to add a SmartArt object you will work in two panes. As you add text on the left side pane, the text is transferred into SmartArt design. You can add or remove bulleted points to suit your own needs.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-212" alt="smart art panes" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArtPanes.jpg" width="500" height="218" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArtPanes.jpg 500w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/SmartArtPanes-300x130.jpg 300w" title="" /></p> <p>Use the features on the <strong>SmartArt Design ribbon</strong> to customize the colours and appearance to suit your presentation. The SmartArt design can be moved, adjusted and resized in the same fashion that a graphic can be adjusted.</p> <h4><a data-url=""></a>Create a Text Box</h4> <p>When building presentations in PowerPoint, you will most often insert text in a slide’s placeholders. However, when you want a label, an object, or have control over where text is positioned you may want to use Text Boxes.</p> <p>Click the Text Box button <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-213" alt="insert icon" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/Insert7.gif" width="23" height="24" title="" />&nbsp;in the <strong>Text</strong> group of the <strong>Insert </strong>tab. Then click and drag on the slide to create a text box. Enter the text then apply formatting.</p> <h4><a data-url=""></a>WordArt</h4> <p>WordArt creates decorative text that can be used to add interest to a document. When WordArt is inserted in a presentation, it becomes an object that you can move and rotate in any direction. To add WordArt to your presentation click on the WordArt button located in the <strong>Text </strong>group of the <strong>Insert </strong>tab. Click on the style of your choice from the WordArt Gallery window which appears.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-214" alt="word art" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/wordart1.gif" width="131" height="203" title="" /></p> <p>Type the text you want in the “Type your Text Here box” that displays on the slide. Notice the <strong>Drawing Tools Format</strong> tab becomes available. Use the commands in the <strong>Format </strong>tab to further enhance your WordArt.</p> <p>Once formatted drag the WordArt to a location on the slide that is suitable for your presentation.</p> </div></div>

PowerPoint offers many entertaining and different slide transition schemes- the trick is to be careful not to use too many different schemes in one presentation. Be selective and consider the appropriateness of the scheme before you apply it to the different slides. Test them out by running the Slide Show and evaluate them for effectiveness. <em>Quality rather then quantity is the key.</em></p> <p>To add transitions to a presentation click on the slide sorter view, located at the bottom of the screen. Thumbnails of all the slides in your presentation will appear. Click on the <strong>Transitions</strong> tab. The transitions tab contains the <strong>Transitions to This Slide</strong> group. From this group choose a special effect to be applied during the transition between the previous slide to the next slide.</p> <p><a data-url=""><br /> <img class="alignnone wp-image-273" alt="" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/Transitionstab-300x27.png" width="500" height="61" title="" /></a></p> <p>To apply transition schemes to all the slides in your presentation select <strong>Apply to All</strong>. You can also adjust the duration of the transitionby setting a time in the Duration box located above Apply To All.</p> <p>When a transition is added to a slide, a transition icon (*) displays below the slide in all of the slide views.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-224" alt="transition icon view" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/transition-icon1.png" width="212" height="154" title="" /></p> <p><a title="Preset_Animations" data-url=""></a>Preset Animations</p> <p>To further enhance your slides you can apply animation to the text and objects. This feature adds a visual aspect to your presentation and can create focus on specific items. When an animation effect is applied to bulleted lists and clip art objects, you can animate one bulleted item or clip art object to appear on the screen with each successive mouse click.</p> <p>Preset <strong>Animations Schemes</strong> are available in the <strong>Animation</strong> group of the <strong>Animations Tab.</strong></p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-225" alt="preset animation" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/presetanimation-1024x95.jpg" width="1024" height="95" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/presetanimation-1024x95.jpg 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/presetanimation-300x27.jpg 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/presetanimation.jpg 1150w" title="" /></p> <p>You must have an object selected on your slide for the animation list to become available. Different types of objects will result in different animation options appearing in the list.</p> <h4><a title="Custom_Animation" data-url=""></a>Custom Animation</h4> <p>Click on the <strong>Animation Pane</strong> in the <strong>Advanced Animation </strong>group on the <strong>Animations </strong>tab and the animation pane appears to the right of the slide pane. Click on Add Animation. There are four options to apply effects to: the entrance, emphasis, exit and motion paths. Choose a slide, select an object on the slide, then add your choice of animation. The effect displays in the Slide pane. Preview the slide show by selecting slide show located at the bottom of the task pane.</p> <p>The Animation task pane allows you to control the order in which text and objects appear on the slide. Once you have applied a custom animation to each object on a slide the objects display in the task pane list box. Objects can be rearranged in the task pane list box, by clicking on the Re-Order arrows below the list.</p> <p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-227" alt="animation pane" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/animationpane.png" width="191" height="610" title="" /></p> <p>To adjust the speed click on the speed option box.</p> <h4><a title="Run_an_Animated_Slide_Show" data-url=""></a>Run an Animated Slide Show</h4> <p>Unlike the slide show in Project 1, clicking the mouse button does not take you from slide to slide – it takes you from object to object. In order to have the bulleted items and clip art objects display on the screen it will be necessary for you to click each time. This is useful for speakers when giving a presentation as it allows them to guide the audience and have them focus on each inpidual point without the distraction of remaining text.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-effective-presentations" title="Effective Presentations"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">20</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Effective Presentations</h2><h2 class="chapter-author">bpayne</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-68" alt="hand pointing at book" src="http://opentextbc.ca/learningpowerpoint/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2013/05/readstudy.gif" width="52" height="50" title="" />&nbsp;Effective Presentations</h3> <hr /> <p><em>Remember</em> to check in with your instructor for Discussion or E-mail messages.</p> <p>In Unit 2 you were introduced to some basic design concepts:</p> <h4>Defining the Purpose of the Presentation</h4> <p>Identifying the purpose helps to provide a focus for the speaker and ensures that a clear message is conveyed to the audience. Limit the number of related topics in the presentation to avoid confusion in the mind of the audience. Ensure that the main topic is clearly stated and then supported and reinforced throughout the entire presentation.</p> <h4>Developing the Content</h4> <p>To create an effective presentation, you must know your subject. If necessary, you may need to research some components of your topic.</p> <h4>Creating Effective Text Presentations</h4> <ul><li>The first slide in the presentation should provide an <strong>introduction</strong> to the topic.&nbsp; It should:&nbsp; gain the attention of the audience; introduce the topic; present the purpose; and forecast the main points</li> <li>The last slide should provide a <strong>conclusion</strong>.&nbsp; It should:&nbsp; summarize the main points; and leave the audience with something to remember</li> <li>In between, there should be a natural flow to the presentation. Each of these remaining slides in a presentation should contain only one main thought or idea. Apply the 7 x 7 rule to the content of these remaining slides. This means that each slide should contain no more than seven lines (bullets) of text and each line of text should contain no more than seven words. This can be achieved by eliminating unnecessary articles, pronouns, and adjectives. Be sure that the grammatical structure of the phrases are parallel to one another and that font sizes are readable.</li> </ul> <p>Now you have some new features to consider when creating a presentation:</p> <h4>Using Graphics Effectively</h4> <p>There are many reasons to include graphic images in a presentation. Some of these reasons are:</p> <ul><li>to present information that cannot be as effectively conveyed in words</li> <li>to involve, interest and motivate the audience</li> <li>to increase audience understanding and create a lasting impression</li> <li>to build credibility and add a sense of reality</li> <li>to provide variety</li> </ul> <p>When choosing a graphic image or picture to add to the presentation consider the effect it will have on the audience and the part it plays in supporting the topic. Just because clip art and other images are available to use, does not necessarily mean they should be included. Too many graphic images in a presentation can be distracting for the audience creating the opposite effect, detracting from rather than enhancing the message.</p> <h4>Polish Up the Presentation</h4> <p>Now that the text is created and entered and appropriate graphic images inserted it is time to put on the finishing touches. If not already selected, choose a <strong>theme template</strong> that will provide an appropriate backdrop to the slides in the presentation. Run the <strong>slide show</strong> to check how each slide will be presented to the audience, and consider applying <strong>transition</strong> and <strong>custom animation</strong> effects to the objects in the presentation.</p> <p>When applying <strong>transition schemes </strong>to the presentation, graphic designers recommend that it is best to use no more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two</strong></span> different effects in one presentation. Using more than two can cause the audience to become fixated on the visual effects and lose sight of the content and message of the presentation. The <strong>title slide</strong> usually has <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>no</strong></span> transition effects applied.</p> <p><strong>Custom animation effects</strong> can be applied to bulleted text or graphic images. When applied to bulleted text, each bulleted paragraph is progressively disclosed to the audience during the running of the <strong>slide show</strong>. This helps to focus the audience attention on each individual bulleted item as it appears on the screen. If <strong>animation effects</strong> are applied to bulleted text, like the use of <strong>transition schemes </strong>it is best to choose and use no more than <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>two</strong></span> different types of effect. This will keep the presentation consistent.</p> <p>You will work again with you partner this week while you do the practice presentations.&nbsp; You and your partner will review each other’s presentation and offer advice and help (your instructor can also give you some help if you need it).&nbsp; Remember to use the Discussion Board that was set up for you and your partner to post the practice presentations for review by each other.&nbsp; You will have the discussion board available for both the presentations and the advice and help for each other.&nbsp; The assignments will be done on your own.</p> <p>The 7 x 7 rule may still be the one that needs the most work.&nbsp; Work at eliminating unnecessary articles, pronouns, and adjectives.&nbsp; Creating a list on a slide will often allow you great flexibility on a slide.&nbsp; Point format means that whole sentences are not required.</p> <p>Following the suggestions for planning, preparation and delivery outlined above will put you on your way to creating and delivering an effective presentation.</p> </div></div>

You send a link (URL) to your audience, and then everyone watches a synchronized view of your slide show in their browser.</p> <p><strong>Choosing a broadcast service</strong> The Broadcast Slide Show feature requires a network service to host the slide show. You can choose from among several services, including a SharePoint server within your organization but for this course we will use the <strong>PowerPoint Broadcast Service</strong>. This service is available to anyone with a <strong>Windows Live ID</strong>. Anyone on the Internet will be able to access the URL for a slide show hosted on this service.</p> <p>Before you broadcast your presentation:</p> <ul><li>The presenter and audience need to be connected to the <strong>Internet</strong>.

When working on a construction project, master carpenters abide by the rule “measure twice, cut once”. Likewise, when it comes to creating a presentation, taking the time to plan and prepare before beginning to create a presentation, will not only make the presentation more enjoyable and effective but will ultimately save you time. Part of this planning is to identify the audience who will be listening to and or watching the presentation and then to choose a medium that is appropriate for conveying the message to this audience. The key to being comfortable and relaxed in front of an audience when you deliver the presentation is <strong>preparation</strong>. When the content is organized in a logical manner, it is much easier to learn and to deliver.</p> <h4>Defining the Purpose of the Presentation</h4> <p>There are many different types of presentations. For a presentation to be successful, it is necessary to begin by defining the purpose. Before beginning ask yourself – Is the presentation meant:</p> <ul><li>to inform?</li> <li>to persuade?</li> <li>to sell?</li> <li>to educate?</li> <li>to motivate?</li> <li>to entertain?</li> </ul> <p>If the presentation is intended to <em><strong>inform</strong> </em>or <em><strong>educate,</strong></em> then the goal of the speaker is to increase the knowledge or ability of the audience by providing new information about an already familiar subject, process, event, or concept.</p> <p>If the presentation is intended to <strong><em>persuade, sell,</em></strong> or<strong><em>motivate,</em></strong> then the goal of the speaker is to change the attitude, belief, or behaviour of the audience. The speaker may present opposing points of view on a particular subject, product, or issue allowing the audience to draw their own conclusions based on the facts presented. Or, the speaker may present and explore a concept or policy concluding with a recommended course of action. This type of presentation can be much more challenging to create and deliver than one meant to inform or educate because it is often based on controversial subjects important not only to the speaker but also to the audience.</p> <p>If the presentation is intended to <em><strong>entertain, </strong></em>then the goal of the speaker is to keep the audience engaged, amused, and interested in the content of the presentation.</p> <p>Identifying the purpose helps to provide a focus for the speaker and ensures that a clear message is conveyed to the audience. Limit the number of related topics in the presentation to avoid confusion in the mind of the audience. Ensure that the main topic is clearly stated and then supported and reinforced throughout the entire presentation.</p> <h4>Developing the Content</h4> <p>To create an effective presentation, you must know your subject. If necessary, you may need to research some components of your topic. Research can enhance your credibility. Knowledge of the latest information in the subject area helps you to anticipate audience reaction and gives you time to prepare ways of dealing with potential controversies. The Internet is one source of current information as well as traditional forms of media including newspapers and magazines. Personal interviews may also be helpful in developing the content of the presentation.</p> <h4>Creating Effective Text Presentations</h4> <p>Once the purpose has been identified and your topic researched, it is time to organize your presentation. The first slide in the presentation should provide an <strong>introduction</strong> to the topic, and the last slide should provide a <strong>conclusion</strong>. In between, there should be a natural flow to the presentation. Using <strong>PowerPoint</strong>‘<strong>s Outline View</strong> is a very effective way to enter and organize the content of the presentation by arranging it into first, second, and third level headings. Each of these remaining slides in a presentation should contain only one main thought or idea. Too many thoughts or ideas on one slide may confuse the audience and cause the speaker to stray from the topic – don’t overwhelm the audience with too much information. Apply the 7 x 7 rule to the content of these remaining slides. This means that each slide should contain no more than seven lines of text and each line of text should contain no more than seven words. This can be achieved by eliminating unnecessary articles, pronouns, and adjectives. Be sure that the grammatical structure of the phrases are parallel to one another and that font sizes are readable.</p> <p>A good <strong>introductory slide</strong>can build speaker confidence and help a speaker to relax. It should be designed to:</p> <ul><li>gain the attention of the audience</li> <li>introduce the topic</li> <li>present the purpose</li> <li>forecast the main points</li> </ul> <p>An effective <strong>concluding slide</strong> needs to be more than an opportunity for the speaker to say <strong>thank you.</strong> The <strong>Closing Slide</strong>should:</p> <ul><li>summarize the main points</li> <li>leave the audience with something to remember</li> </ul> <p>The <strong>remaining slides </strong>in the presentation should:</p> <ul><li>contain only one main idea</li> <li>maintain a consistent layout</li> <li>follow the 7 x 7 rule</li> <li>keep phrases parallel</li> </ul> <h4>Using Graphics Effectively</h4> <p>There are many reasons to include graphic images in a presentation. Some of these reasons are:</p> <ul><li>to present information that cannot be as effectively conveyed in words</li> <li>to involve, interest, and motivate the audience</li> <li>to increase audience understanding and create a lasting impression</li> <li>to build credibility and add a sense of reality</li> <li>to provide variety</li> </ul> <p>When choosing a graphic image or picture to add to the presentation, consider the effect it will have on the audience and the part it plays in supporting the topic. Just because clip art and other images are available to use, does not necessarily mean they should be included. Too many graphic images in a presentation can be distracting for the audience creating the opposite effect, detracting from rather than enhancing the message.</p> <h4>Polish Up the Presentation</h4> <p>Now that the text is created and entered and appropriate graphic images inserted, it is time to put on the finishing touches. If not already selected, choose a <strong>theme template</strong> that will provide an appropriate backdrop to the slides in the presentation. Run the <strong>slide show</strong> to check how each slide will be presented to the audience, and consider applying <strong>transition</strong> and <strong>custom animation</strong> effects to the objects in the presentation.</p> <p>When applying <strong>transition schemes </strong>to the presentation, graphic designers recommend that it is best to use no more than two different effects in one presentation. Using more than two can cause the audience to become fixated on the visual effects and lose sight of the content and message of the presentation. The <strong>title slide</strong> usually has <strong>no transition</strong> effects applied.</p> <p><strong>Custom animation effects</strong> can be applied to bulleted text or graphic images. When applied to bulleted text, each bulleted paragraph is progressively disclosed to the audience during the running of the <strong>slide show</strong>. This helps to focus the audience attention on each individual bulleted item as it appears on the screen. If <strong>animation effects</strong> are applied to bulleted text, like the use of <strong>transition schemes </strong>it is best to choose and use no more than two different types of effect. This will keep the presentation consistent.</p> <h4>Delivering the Presentation</h4> <p>Though the presentation may be prepared to be delivered online on the Web or perhaps run endlessly in a kiosk, more often than not the presentation is used as a visual tool to accompany a speech in front of an audience. This is the point when it all comes together for you. Some of the following tips may help when <strong>delivering the presentation.</strong></p> <h5><strong>Practice Makes Perfect</strong></h5> <p>Be prepared! You cannot bluff your way through a presentation. Practice aloud several times while running the slides and referring to the speaker’s notes. Practice using the equipment and the different software features.</p> <h5><strong>Polish your Delivery</strong></h5> <p>Look at the audience while speaking – make eye contact. This opens up communication and gains credibility for your message. Try not to read verbatim from the speaker’s notes. Speak clearly and try to vary your tone of voice always making sure that the person in the back row can hear you. Try not to stand directly in front of the projector. Stand to the side and face the audience as much as possible.</p> <h5><strong>Arrive Early</strong></h5> <p>This will give you time to check out the equipment and let you gather your thoughts as you set up the presentation. Start PowerPoint and be sure that the show will run and that your notes are with you or on the lectern. Relax and greet people as they arrive. Distribute handouts before or after, not during, the presentation.</p> <h5><strong>Be Flexible and Courteous</strong></h5> <p>Be prepared to adjust to the audience demands. Questions from the audience may require that you return to a previous slide or that you may not be able to cover all slides and so need to advance more quickly.</p> <p>Following the suggestions for planning, preparation, and delivery outlined above will put you on your way to creating and delivering an effective presentation.</p> <p>Click the <strong>Next Topic</strong> arrow to proceed to the <strong>Presentation Checklist </strong>and then the instructions for completing the <strong>Final Project</strong>.</p> </div></div>
