This will assist administrators in program, budget, and resource planning. In many cases, it will be educational technologists, instructional designers, and other staff who will be performing the tasks outlined in this guide.</p> <p>Individuals who are preparing to develop or facilitate similar courses may also benefit from this guide, and may choose to adapt it for their own courses. However, because the emphasis is on facilitating in a community of learners and supporting collaboration and reflective practices, it may not be as beneficial for those focusing on teacher-created content or transmissive models.</p> <h1>About this guide</h1> <p>The authors of this guide – Gina Bennett, Beth Cougler Blom, Sylvia Currie, and Sylvia Riessner – created it to provide all current and future FLO facilitators with details about our practices to make your job easier, and to give you a comprehensive picture of how to facilitate FLO courses. It builds on our experiences developing and facilitating the FLO courses and mentoring others to do the same. We use exemplary contributions to the courses, instructions, ideas, and materials, as well as facilitation strategies that have worked for us.</p> <p>Ultimately, our intention is to provide support and mentorship for FLO facilitators and to share the vision of what we are trying to accomplish with this family of courses. This guide will help us be more clear with ourselves and others about what that is, and how to keep moving forward with a robust program.</p> <h1>How to use this guide</h1> <p>This guide is not necessarily a linear read. The first three chapters are of value to all facilitators and those curious about FLO courses; however, FLO facilitators and mentors may choose to refer mainly to the course-specific chapters.</p> <p>The introduction, Chapter 1: What is Facilitation? and Chapter 2: FLO Family of Courses, are applicable to all readers. These chapters will help you understand how we approach facilitation, and the context in which we have developed and refined this collection of courses.</p> <p>Chapter 3: Facilitating FLO outlines recommended steps for preparing to facilitate FLO, as well as the facilitation and hosting models for those interested in offering the courses in-house. This chapter will be of interest to all future facilitators, but also to administrative and support staff.</p> <p>Chapter 4: FLO Fundamentals, Chapter 5: FLO Design, Chapter 6: FLO Synchronous and Chapter 7: FLO MicroCourses, provide specific details about planning and facilitating each course. Jump directly to the course you plan to facilitate, or read them all as a way to determine if you want to expand your offerings to include other courses.</p> <p>Each FLO course chapter (4 – 7) is associated with an open educational resource (OER) for that course. The OER resources have been developed using the Moodle learning management system, and you are free to use them in a variety of ways:</p> <ul><li>Browse the courses from <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=16" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=16">BCcampus’s SCoPE website</a>.</li> <li>Download each course (as an .MBZ file) using the “Download this Course” link on the homepage of each course.</li> <li>Copy the contents of all, or part of, each course into your own learning management system.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="719-1"></span></span></li> </ul> </div><div class="footnotes"><div id='719-1'>We have used the Moodle Learning Management System to implement FLO courses.

The <a href="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/facilitate" data-url="https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/facilitate">Oxford English Dictionary</a> defines the verb facilitate as:</p> <blockquote><p>Make (an action or process) easy or easier.</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ica-uk.org.uk/what-we-mean-by-facilitation/" data-url="https://www.ica-uk.org.uk/what-we-mean-by-facilitation/">The Institute of Cultural Affairs – UK</a>, describes the role of a facilitator as using a set of skills</p> <blockquote><p>“…in working with a group, enabling and supporting them to achieve their objectives in a way that involves and respects all contributions, builds ownership and releases the potential of the group and its members.”</p></blockquote> <h1>What is facilitation in an educational context?</h1> <p>As educational philosophies developed and a growing number of adults began to participate in higher education (not only youth or young adults), beliefs and pedagogical practices changed to accommodate the richer experience and knowledge that learners brought to the classroom. Adult learning theory had a profound impact on the way courses were designed and delivered, and the developing ideas around social constructivist learning and humanist teaching approaches influenced many instructors to move from acting as the “sage on the stage” and instead, to begin supporting or scaffolding the learning that was meaningful for each student (e.g., acting as the “guide on the side”).</p> <p>A concurrent shift in teaching practice occurred as educators recognized that traditional approaches were not successful in developing the 21st-century skills that learners needed (e.g., critical thinking and the ability to communicate effectively, innovate, and solve problems through negotiation and collaboration). Research consistently suggested that collaborative learning and personalized learning strategies were successful in supporting the deeper learning needed.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="722-1"></span></span></p> <p>Many teachers began to modify their practices to include facilitative teaching rather than direct teaching. While teaching methods will still vary depending on the subject, level of learning or intended outcomes, the focus is generally on helping learners understand course content through questioning and suggestions while providing rich cases, complex problems, and opportunities to apply new knowledge in different contexts.</p> <h1>Facilitating learning online</h1> <p>A model or framework of online learning referred to as the Community of Inquiry was one of the first to identify the increasing role of the learner and the importance of having teachers facilitate social and cognitive interactions. Research collected over more than 18 years demonstrated the importance of facilitation of learning through listening, connecting ideas, and involving learners in “…meaningful and educationally worthwhile learning” (Chapter 3: Facilitation – <a href="http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229" data-url="http://www.aupress.ca/index.php/books/120229">Teaching in Blended Learning Environments</a> – Vaughan, et al, 2013, p.47).</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='722-1'>

In one week, you will dip into the FLO experience and leave with something practical and useful for your own teaching practice. Topics are emergent and relate to designing and facilitating learning online.</p> <h1>The FLO story (the short version!)</h1> <p>The first Facilitating Learning Online course was called Instructional Skills Workshop Online (ISWO) and was developed by Royal Roads University in 2008 through the BCcampus Online Program Development [https://bccampus.ca/open-education/] fund. This course was based on the well-known Instructional Skills Workshop, but focused on facilitating online, rather than in person.</p> <p>In 2013, BCcampus began offering what is now called FLO Fundamentals. It is an adaptation of the original ISWO, and was subsequently revised several times. In 2015, the name of the workshop changed from Instructional Skills Workshop Online (ISWO) to Facilitating Learning Online (FLO), more closely reflecting the focus on online facilitation.</p> <p>From the beginning, our goal was to prepare educators across the BC post-secondary system to effectively facilitate learning online- first by hosting, refining and growing the collection of courses, then by supporting the adoption and expansion process in a way that maintains a high quality and consistent experience for faculty and staff across institutions. All FLO courses are open educational resources (OER) and available for institutions to implement in-house.</p> <div class="textbox shaded">The term Open Educational Resources (OER) was first defined by <a href="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-are-open-educational-resources-oers/" data-url="http://www.unesco.org/new/en/communication-and-information/access-to-knowledge/open-educational-resources/what-are-open-educational-resources-oers/">UNESCO in 2002</a> as “any type of educational materials that are in the public domain or introduced with an open license” and can “range from textbooks to curricula, syllabi, lecture notes, assignments, tests, projects, audio, video and animation.”</div> <div><p>Over the years, participant feedback has informed our curriculum revisions and development, resulting in the redesign of FLO Fundamentals and the addition of two other courses: FLO Design and FLO Synchronous. Later, we recognized a need to appeal to faculty and staff who were unable to commit to a course spanning several weeks, and we introduced the one-week MicroCourse. We expect to grow the FLO family of MicroCourses. Suggestions for MicroCourse topics continue to emerge, such as assessing learning, multimedia development, open pedagogy, and digital literacy.</p> </div> <h1>Who are the FLO learners?</h1> <p>We have attracted a range of learners to FLO courses: very experienced educators, experienced online instructors, new-to-online instructors, and even those new to both instruction and online learning. The courses have also been popular in teaching and learning centres and with other post-secondary institution staff, as well as with individuals from private and non-profit organizations.</p> <h1>What makes FLO unique?</h1> <p>FLO courses provide you with a participatory and learner-centred experience to enhance the skills you need to facilitate your own online courses and activities. The FLO experience is very different from an independent and self-directed study. In addition, the courses provide an ideal environment to mentor future FLO facilitators.</p> <p>The following list captures our philosophy and approach:</p> <p>Design and Development</p> <ul><li>Experienced learning designers and educators design and develop the courses.</li> <li>We undergo pilots, extensive testing and improvement cycles, incorporating feedback and suggestions from educators from various fields and institutions.</li> <li>Courses are licensed <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC BY</a>, meaning you can copy, remix, transform, and build upon the work, and we hope you will!

We hope there will be many, many facilitators ready to adopt FLO courses and implement them in their own institutions.</p> <p>The next chapter looks at how to prepare for facilitating FLO courses.</p> <h1>Attributions</h1> <p>The OER definition from the <a href="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/facultyoertoolkit/" data-url="https://pressbooks.bccampus.ca/facultyoertoolkit/">Faculty OER Toolkit</a>&nbsp;is used under a CC BY 4.0 Licence.</p> <h1>Image descriptions</h1> <p><strong id="&quot;fig2.1"><a id="fig2.1" class="internal" data-url=""></a>Figure 2.1 long description:</strong></p> <blockquote><p>“The FLO family of courses are jam-packed with pedagogically sound inspiration, current ideas, helpful resources and a network of amazing participants, instructors, and facilitators, who are all interested in making teaching and learning online the best it can be.

Subsequent chapters will guide you through the steps and considerations for facilitating each course.</p> <h1>Accessible design, inclusive facilitation</h1> <p>An important part of becoming a better online facilitator is to understand and integrate the principles of accessible design and inclusive teaching and facilitation. Many educators point to the <a href="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/" data-url="http://udlguidelines.cast.org/">Universal Design for Learning framework</a>,<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="735-1"></span></span> which focuses on providing multiple means of:</p> <ul><li>Engagement</li> <li>Representation</li> <li>Action and Expression</li> </ul> <p>While FLO courses were designed to promote inclusive and participatory learning, particularly through encouraging multiple means of engagement, action and expression, there is always a need to review our materials, our design and our facilitation and teaching strategies. Ensuring accessibility of learning is an ongoing quest, as technologies change and we gain experience in online facilitation of FLO courses.</p> <p>BCcampus Open Education has produced (or identified) several practical and helpful guides to help you improve the accessibility of each FLO course you offer. The current <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/">Accessibility Toolkit – 2nd Edition</a> focuses on the application of Universal Instructional Design (UID) and includes an <a href="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/back-matter/appendix-checklist-for-accessibility-toolkit/" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/accessibilitytoolkit/back-matter/appendix-checklist-for-accessibility-toolkit/">easy-to-use checklist (Appendix A)</a> that will develop your understanding of the potential impact of various types of diversity (primarily cognitive and physical). The insights shared in the Toolkit will help you understand the importance of taking time to make changes to your content and delivery. Try to think proactively about the accessibility of your FLO course—both as you design it and during the facilitation of it.</p> <p>Some basic questions to ask yourself as you facilitate FLO courses:</p> <ul><li>Do I have materials (visual, multimedia, documents) that present important concepts or information that not all students may be able to see, hear, or access?</li> <li>Do I use facilitation strategies that may exclude some learners or present barriers to participation?</li> <li>If I utilize new apps or tools to encourage exploration of online teaching and learning, do I have alternatives for those who can’t (or don’t wish to) use these technologies?</li> <li>As I think about the diversity of my learners, can I imagine how they perceive the learning environment and experience my presentations, comments, interaction with learners?</li> </ul> <h1>Roles and functions of FLO facilitators</h1> <p>FLO courses are built on a foundation of social constructivist perspectives, infused with a recognition of the importance of evidence-based practices, the power of shared reflection and inquiry, and the need for personally meaningful learning experiences.</p> <p>FLO facilitators adapt their roles to the needs of each cohort of learners as they progress through a course. During the first week of each course, facilitator presence is high as the facilitators take on the roles of a community builder and a guide. FLO facilitators welcome and engage learners, post frequent reminders, clarify curriculum, troubleshoot problems, and encourage each learner to participate and learn. They take time to develop connections with and among learners to help develop a sense of community and mutually supportive learning.</p> <p>As the course moves on and learners become more familiar with the course expectations, content and environment, they become more active participants in the co-creation of meaningful learning. FLO facilitators take on the roles of coach and mentor. They step back and encourage learning through the use of different questioning strategies and proven facilitation techniques. They participate in discussions but don’t lead; instead, FLO facilitators highlight important concepts, weave together the ideas that participants share, and post frequent summaries to help learners keep track of the flow of conversations as they move in and out of the course environment.</p> <p>FLO courses are designed to provide a structured yet flexible learning environment, respecting many of the core principles of <a href="https://udlresource.ca/" data-url="https://udlresource.ca/">BC’s Universal Design for Learning</a> (UDL). FLO facilitators strive to identify and respond to the varying needs, abilities and interests of each learner. The courses are developmental in focus. Although FLO facilitators provide frequent and constructive (formative) feedback, they encourage participants to use the self-assessment rubrics and reflective practices embedded in each course to monitor and celebrate their own achievements. FLO facilitators help participants stay on track and make explicit links between course activities and learning outcomes.</p> <p>As each course draws to a close, the FLO facilitators help individual participants complete activities and assess their progress. Participants share final reflections and often help plan and host a final wrap-up session to celebrate achievements and to look ahead to future connections and applications of new learning.</p> <h1>Developing FLO facilitation skills<a id="3.1" class="internal" data-url=""></a></h1> <div class="wp-caption alignleft" style="width: 314px"><img class="" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Puzzle-Colour-298x300.png" alt="Four groups of skills.

We encourage people interested in facilitating FLO courses to spend some time reading about online facilitation, open education practices and Universal Design for Learning, before facilitating FLO courses. We also recognize that you could gain online facilitation skills while facilitating – including reflecting on that facilitation. Working with others to co-facilitate FLO courses can also support the development of online facilitation skills as we watch and learn from what our colleagues do.</p> <p>We’ve gathered a list of skills that we have found effective in facilitating FLO courses and grouped them under four main categories: Support Diverse Learners Online, Build and Sustain Online Community, Manage the Online Course, and Model Effective Facilitation.</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 1142px;"><caption>Core FLO Facilitation Skills</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 36px;"><th style="width: 25%; text-align: center; height: 36px;" scope="col">Core FLO Facilitation Skill</th> <th style="width: 75%; text-align: center; height: 36px;" scope="col">Description</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="height: 349px;"><td style="width: 25%; height: 349px;"><strong>Support Diverse Learners Online</strong></td> <td style="width: 75%; height: 349px;"><ul><li>Communicate goals and roles for learning activities for groups and individuals.</li> <li>Invite participants to share cultural and acquired knowledge and perspectives.</li> <li>Support learners to develop effective online learning strategies.</li> <li>Encourage participatory, connected learning.</li> <li>Encourage learners to take risks and try new approaches.</li> <li>Promote reflective practice and critical/creative thinking.</li> <li>Provide timely, formative feedback to individuals and group.</li> <li>Assist learners in self-assessment of learning using rubrics.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 285px;"><td style="width: 25%; height: 285px;"><strong>Build and Sustain Online Community</strong></td> <td style="width: 75%; height: 285px;"><ul><li>Build a safe and supportive learning community.</li> <li>Use strategies to build rapport with learners.</li> <li>Develop guidelines for constructive feedback.</li> <li>Model respectful, appreciative dialogue.</li> <li>Encourage learners to identify norms of behaviour.</li> <li>Assist learners to develop positive responses to conflicts.</li> <li>Connect with external experts for selected topics or activities.</li> <li>Explore open learning resources or communities.</li> <li>Close community by supporting final reflections, individual self-assessments and shared learnings.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 178px;"><td style="width: 25%; height: 178px;"><strong>Manage Course&nbsp;Online&nbsp;</strong></td> <td style="width: 75%; height: 178px;"><ul><li>Design functional learning spaces that are easy to navigate.</li> <li>Select appropriate tools within the learning system.</li> <li>Share content in varied ways.</li> <li>Maintain currency and relevance of references and resources.</li> <li>Aid learners by providing varied ways to participate in activities or complete assignments.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 294px;"><td style="width: 25%; height: 294px;"><strong>Model Effective Online Facilitation</strong></td> <td style="width: 75%; height: 294px;"><ul><li>Model a positive and professional presence throughout the course.</li> <li>Plan effectively with co-facilitator(s).</li> <li>Manage time effectively.</li> <li>Seek regular feedback from learners.</li> <li>Maintain a balanced presence throughout the course.</li> <li>Use varied questioning techniques to extend and deepen discussions.</li> <li>Develop strategies to monitor participation and respond to potential issues.</li> <li>Engage in, and model, reflective practice.</li> <li>Explore new pedagogical approaches to enrich facilitation practice.</li> <li>Develop technical skills and explore new tools.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p>We know it’s a big list and probably not an exhaustive one, but it’s a start. To create it, we drew skills from the self-assessment rubric included in FLO Fundamentals and crowd-sourced ideas from people who have facilitated FLO courses. We also drew some inspiration from the <a href="https://www.iaf-world.org/site/professional/core-competencies" data-url="https://www.iaf-world.org/site/professional/core-competencies">International Association of Facilitators (IAF)’s list of Core Competencies</a>.</p> <p>The interesting—and most exciting!—thing about facilitating FLO courses is that, in addition to talking about online facilitation skills with our participants throughout the course, we also model those same skills. We want our participants to see us continually working on enhancing the skills in ourselves – to model reflective practice as an online facilitator and to bring an authentic presence to our courses.</p> <p>Throughout the chapters included in this guide, we’ll dig deeper — and provide examples — into what it looks like to use these facilitation skills.</p> <h1>Our model</h1> <p>It is beyond the scope of this guide to delve into institutional adoption needs and processes. Instead, we offer an emergent model that has proven to be effective in preparing FLO facilitators. Your institution may wish to adopt a similar model or consider partnering with other institutions that already have.</p> <p><strong>Take FLO courses:&nbsp; </strong>Experience the roles of online learner, collaborative team member, activity designer and facilitator, together with colleagues from a variety of disciplines. Complete FLO courses in any sequence.</p> <p>Experiencing the role of participant in the course you wish to facilitate is one of the best ways to understand the structure, flow and resources that make up the course. You will also experience the value of facilitated learning.</p> <p><strong>Apply what you’ve learned:&nbsp; </strong>Completing one or more FLO courses will provide you with new ideas to implement in your own teaching and to share with colleagues. Consider embarking on a scholarly research project to present your work to a larger audience!</p> <p>In other words, practice any chance you get, and share with your colleagues.</p> <p><strong>Become a FLO facilitator:&nbsp; </strong>Although the facilitators in FLO Fundamentals try to make their facilitation visible, a lot of planning and adaptation still takes place behind the scenes.&nbsp; In our experience, the best way to learn how to facilitate a FLO course is to co-facilitate with a more experienced facilitator as a mentor.</p> <p>Volunteering your time and expertise to assist — and be mentored by — experienced FLO facilitators is a perfect mutual exchange. We encourage mentees and facilitators to negotiate the level of commitment and tasks.</p> <p><strong>Adopt FLO / Become a lead facilitator and mentor:&nbsp; </strong>An obvious next step for your institution to sustain or expand FLO offerings is to bring more facilitators on board. Once you have the experience of facilitating FLO courses you are ready to mentor incoming facilitators.</p> <p>As open-licensed resources, FLO courses can be hosted in-house, and offer opportunities for cross-institutional collaboration and cost-saving professional development.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_74" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-74" style="width: 144px"><img class="wp-image-74" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image4.png" alt="A photo of Leonne Beebe" width="144" height="220" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-74">Figure 3.3</div></div> <h2>Leonne Beebe</h2> <p>Leonne Beebe is a seasoned FLO participant and facilitator, having returned to FLO for every offering in some capacity, each time taking on more responsibility and new challenges. Leonne transitioned from being mentored to being a full-on facilitator by boldly accepting each invitation to take on more. She brings years of teaching experience and keen participatory observation skills to the workshop.</p> <p>Leonne offers this for future facilitators:</p> <blockquote><p>“The FLO/FDO mentoring model for learning to facilitate online makes the learning both real and realizable. As a teacher, you have the concurrent experience of being a student while also being a teacher. Through your experiences, you will develop an awareness and empathy for the learning challenges and the strategies needed for student success. You may also find one time is just the beginning…”</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_75" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" style="width: 100px"><img class="wp-image-75 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image5.jpg" alt="photo of Rachel Loganberg" width="100" height="100" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-75">Figure 3.4</div></div> <h2>Rachel Loganberg</h2> <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-loganberg-bab0058b/" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rachel-loganberg-bab0058b/">Rachel Loganberg</a> from <a href="http://www.cotr.bc.ca/" data-url="http://www.cotr.bc.ca/">College of the Rockies</a> volunteered her time and expertise by taking on an observer role in the <a href="https://bccampus.ca/2017/05/19/introducing-flo-design/" data-url="https://bccampus.ca/2017/05/19/introducing-flo-design/">FLO Design pilot</a>.

Think about the nature of FLO courses, the underlying philosophy, the intended audience and the proposed learning outcomes.</p> <h1>Foundational or essential technologies</h1> <p>In general, online learning courses are hosted in content or learning management systems. FLO courses were originally developed and offered using the open source learning management system called Moodle. The OER files for FLO courses are available as Moodle mbz files that can be imported directly to another Moodle system or translated and imported by most other well-known learning management systems.</p> <p>FLO courses generally require a system that allows :</p> <ul><li>registration and login accounts for students (to protect privacy and support management of the learning event),</li> <li>forums to allow text-based discussion (preferably augmented with images, audio and video) that is persistent so students can participate at different times and from different locations,</li> <li>a place online to store resources that support the learning, and</li> <li>a synchronous online (web conferencing) meeting system. An additional desirable feature would be the ability to assign facilitator level access to this tool to allow students to experience both learner and facilitator roles.</li> </ul> <h1>Important additional technologies</h1> <p>The following additional features may be available within a learning management system or as complementary tools or could even be provided through the judicious selection and use of social media.</p> <p>FLO courses can benefit from the ability to:</p> <ul><li>create and share quick surveys or lengthier quizzes,</li> <li>allow learners to create short videos or audio recordings and share privately to other course participants and the facilitator,</li> <li>vote or indicate preferences within forum discussions, or when collaborating on group learning activities, and</li> <li>create private or shared group forums, folders, etc. to support collaborative learning.</li> </ul> <p>Some questions to consider:</p> <ul><li>Do you have an institutional content or learning management system? Will you be expected to use this system?</li> <li>Are you familiar with the available tools or complementary technologies that your institution may offer that would support your delivery of FLO courses?</li> <li>How much support could you ask for during your delivery of a FLO course? If support is limited, can you utilize the tools well enough to use on your own when you are facilitating the course?</li> </ul> <h1>Using open source or social media tools</h1> <p>As technologies continue to evolve, the choices of tools (often free or open source) provide an endless array of potential pedagogical value for instructors.</p> <p>Check with your institution’s teaching support or technology support departments; they may already have tools available that will allow you to try a different pedagogical approach to your FLO course delivery. Think about what you think will benefit your learners as you deliver a FLO course. There are advantages to trying new teaching approaches using tools that have been tested and are supported by other instructors or technology experts where you work.</p> <p>If you want to explore the use of open educational resources, tools or teaching approaches, check what is available in-house (e.g., <a href="https://www.kpu.ca/open" data-url="https://www.kpu.ca/open">Kwantlen Polytechnic Open Education</a>, <a href="http://ctet.royalroads.ca/resources-teaching" data-url="http://ctet.royalroads.ca/resources-teaching">Royal Roads Resources for teaching</a>) and contact <a href="https://open.bccampus.ca/what-is-open-education/" data-url="https://open.bccampus.ca/what-is-open-education/">BCcampus Open Education</a> for ideas.</p> <p>If you want to use tools that are not supported within your institution, ask yourself:</p> <ul><li>Why do I want to use this tool? What value do I hope it can provide to the learning experience of my learners?</li> <li>Does my institution have guidelines or rules about the use of social media or the protection of learner privacy?</li> <li>What characteristics or affordances does the tool offer that I believe will benefit the learners?</li> <li>What impact will this have on my learners? Will they need to sign up for an account? Can I use this tool and protect their privacy?</li> <li>Can I provide alternatives to learners who don’t want to use this tool?</li> <li>What happens to anything we record or create using this tool? Sometimes free social media tools retain copyright to what you create when you use their tool. It may not matter but you should consider the implications before using a new tool.</li> </ul> </div></div>

However, we do recommend that you have some previous experience with online learning and facilitation.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="751-1"></span></span></p> <p><strong>Time Requirements for Facilitators</strong>: The time commitment for facilitators varies widely. Facilitators can expect to spend anywhere from 15 to 25 hours per week during the preparation and implementation of this course. First-time hosts may require more time. Facilitators should expect to be available to the course on a daily basis.</p> <p><strong>Expectations – Participants</strong>: Participants are expected to participate actively and collaboratively throughout each week, exploring facilitation ideas and techniques and engaging in weekly activities. A key activity is to participate as a member of a team to facilitate a one-week online exercise and discussion.</p> <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Throughout the course, participants reflect on learning through the use of learning journals and rubrics. Participants also provide constructive feedback on the team facilitation skills of others, and respond to feedback on their own team efforts.</p> <p><strong>Time Requirements for Participants</strong>: Participants should expect to spend 6 – 12 hours per week for online activities and course readings. More time will be required during the week the participant is facilitating the discussion with their team.</p> <p><strong>Primary Resource for Facilitators</strong>: All materials (introductory information, suggested readings, detailed discussion topics, etc.) for the course are included in the <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=22" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=22">FLO Fundamentals OER from BCcampus</a>, available for viewing or download. This guide is based on the 2019 version of the course and version 3.x of the Moodle learning management system.</p> <h1>What is FLO Fundamentals?</h1> <p>This is a mostly asynchronous online course, delivered over five sequential weeks. Two or three one-hour synchronous sessions are optional but recommended to facilitate community building and to provide valuable exposure to synchronous facilitation. Your primary role is to build and sustain the online community: pre-planning the course, communicating regularly with participants, providing supplementary materials, organizing and coaching teams, and supporting participants’ experimentation with a variety of online learning tools.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the course works like this: in Week 1, you get everyone enrolled in the course, familiar with the layout, and introduced to each other. The FLO facilitators then start the discussion for Week 1’s assigned topic and guide participants to experience what it feels like to help build an active online community. By the end of Week 1, participants are organized into four teams: each team will be responsible for facilitating an assigned topic for one of the following weeks. During each of the following four weeks, you provide participants with readings and a discussion topic related to the readings. The team responsible for that week facilitates the discussion while the course facilitators provide support from the sidelines and are less visible in the discussion.</p> <p>Keep in mind that in facilitating this first week’s discussion, you are demonstrating good facilitation skills and providing a model for how participant teams might facilitate a weekly activity when it’s their turn. Depending on your participants, you may wish to make this point more or less explicit.</p> <p>FLO Fundamentals has proven to be an effective—and often transformative—learning experience. Our experience has shown that a class of 14 – 20 educators is a good size for this course and we highly recommend that you enlist a co-facilitator to support this group. You can expect to be involved in the course every day for a total of 15 – 25 hours per week (more if this is your first time) during the preparation and implementation of this course.</p> <h1>Learning outcomes</h1> <p>FLO Fundamentals develops key themes for successful online facilitation. At the end of this course, participants should be (better) able to:</p> <h2>Build and sustain online community</h2> <ul><li>Reflect on the experience of an online learning community.</li> <li>Explore the role of instructor presence in online learning.</li> </ul> <h2>Support diverse learners online</h2> <ul><li>Observe UDL principles and identify ways to help diverse learners online.</li> <li>Use facilitation strategies and tools to address the needs of adult learners.</li> </ul> <h2>Facilitate collaborative and individual learning</h2> <ul><li>Facilitate collaborative and individual activities online.</li> <li>Explore group dynamics in online collaborative activities.</li> </ul> <h2>Provide constructive feedback and assessment</h2> <ul><li>Model effective feedback and assessment.</li> <li>Critically reflect on feedback and experience to self-evaluate work and learning.</li> </ul> <h2>Manage the online course environment</h2> <ul><li>Explore effective strategies to manage the workload.</li> <li>Improve the use of tools within an online learning environment.</li> </ul> <h1>Participants</h1> <p>A wide variety of educators benefit from FLO Fundamentals. Participants are often full- or part-time instructors at post-secondary educational institutions who are new to teaching online or have already been teaching online for some time but would like to develop stronger facilitation skills. Other participants may be familiar with traditional teaching practices but are seeking to develop experience and confidence with more learner-centric educational approaches.</p> <p>FLO Fundamentals may also be of interest to many other educators, including instructional/learning designers, educational developers, learning technologists and others who work in teaching and learning centres. It may also be useful for graduate students, consultants from the private sector, trainers employed by for-profit or non-profit organizations, and educational support providers.</p> <h1>Technology</h1> <p>FLO Fundamentals requires no special technology beyond what has been recommended in Chapter 3: Tools to Support FLO. Because FLO Fundamentals is usually the first FLO course participants will encounter (and sometimes their first online course ever), be cautious about using too many external tools or apps until you are better aware of your participants’ comfort levels.</p> <h1>Course content and layout</h1> <p>FLO Fundamentals is a complete five-week workshop-style course with a comprehensive collection of information, activities, directions, assessments, and related resources. Within the Open Education Resources (OER) version of the course, resources are organized into tabs, with one tab for each of the five weeks, plus one Hub tab with introductory and general information, and one tab to organize the work of the teams (see the image below for an example).</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_749" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-749" style="width: 659px"><img class="wp-image-83" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image3-3.png" alt="A screenshot of tabs listed on the FLO Fundamentals website" width="659" height="388" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-749">Figure 4.1</div></div> <p>In the Hub tab, you will find:</p> <ul><li>A Course Handbook, describing for participants how the course works, what’s expected of them, learning outcomes, scheduling, etc.</li> <li>A sample Schedule to help participants (and facilitators) stay on track.</li> <li>Resources to help facilitators organize participant teams.</li> <li>Sample forums to facilitate discussion: <ul><li>An Open Forum for sharing general information (clarification, announcements, social-type sharing) not necessarily related to the weekly discussion about content. Both facilitators and participants can post and respond.</li> <li>A Weekly Journal Share forum, for posting reflections on learning.</li> <li>A forum to provide Feedback for participant teams.</li> </ul> </li> <li>A feedback form (Feel, Like, Improve, Feedback, or FLIF) to help participant teams reflect and receive personal, private feedback on their facilitation experience. (In the OER course, this feedback is structured using the Learning Management System’s quiz tool.)</li> <li>Additional resources for facilitators to aid in coordination of the course (generally hidden from participants).</li> </ul> <p>Tabs corresponding to each week’s activities include:</p> <ul><li>An overview of the topic for the week.</li> <li>A forum to discuss the week’s topic (e.g. to respond to the questions posted by the facilitation team).</li> <li>Other resources and/or activities specific to that week.</li> </ul> <p>The tab for Facilitation Teams Workspace includes:</p> <ul><li>A detailed activity plan for each team.</li> <li>A workspace forum (private, if you choose) for each team’s members to plan their facilitation strategies and tasks.</li> </ul> <p>The topics discussed in this course are:</p> <ul><li>Week 1: Building Learning Community (facilitated by course facilitators).</li> <li>Week 2: Diversity of Learners (facilitated by the orange team).</li> <li>Week 3: Responsive Facilitation (facilitated by the blue team).</li> <li>Week 4: Collaboration (facilitated by the yellow team).</li> <li>Week 5: Reflective Practice (facilitated by the green team).</li> </ul> <h1>Course assessment strategies</h1> <p>This course is designed to be developmental; it is not a graded course in the traditional sense. Unless you decide otherwise, your participants will not be marked or assigned a formal grade on their performance. The course does include a number of activities to encourage self-reflection, as well as a comprehensive self-assessment rubric which could be used to assign a grade, if needed (see <a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-fundamentals-self-assessment-rubric" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-fundamentals-self-assessment-rubric/">FLO Fundamentals Self-Assessment Rubric</a>).</p> <p>Participants are also encouraged to self-assess their qualification for a Certificate of Completion. As facilitator(s), it is up to you to decide what form this Certificate should take.</p> <h1>Facilitator task list: What you need to do before, during and after the course</h1> <p>The successful hosting of FLO Fundamentals requires good planning, timing, and coordination. Over the years, we’ve developed a detailed, step-by-step Task List for course facilitators:</p> <ul><li>See&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-fundamentals-task-list" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-fundamentals-task-list/">FLO Fundamentals Task List</a>&nbsp;for a concise, detailed list of facilitator tasks.</li> <li>You can also use the following Task List Explanations alongside the Task List for more background information and ideas.</li> </ul> <h2>Task List Explanations</h2> <p>Several weeks (or months) before the course begins</p> <ol><li><strong>Access the OER course</strong>. The OER course <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=22" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=22">Facilitating Learning Online – Fundamentals</a> is currently offered as a Moodle course with guest access; you should be able to enter the course and view all content.</li> <li><strong>Set up your own learning environment and copy content</strong>.&nbsp;Before you can offer FLO Fundamentals, you need a learning environment – a virtual place to host the course. At the very minimum, you need an online space (private or securable, if you choose) where facilitators and participants can conduct discussions and share facilitation discoveries and the results of experimentation. The course content must be added to the LMS or other learning space you have chosen:<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="751-2"></span></span> <ol><li>If using Moodle: restore the latest version of this course into your LMS (you can download it using the link in the OER).</li> <li>If NOT using Moodle: establish and configure an online learning environment (LMS, CMS, wiki, etc.) into which you can copy all relevant content from FLO Fundamentals.</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>If possible, find a colleague to assist you as a Co-Facilitator</strong>. Your ideal co-facilitator will be someone who can work with you to provide guidance and support to your participants, and can dedicate 15 to 25 hours per week to this task. Ideally, your co-facilitator will be familiar with online learning theories and practices, and with personal and technical skills to engage online participants. Not only do co-facilitators lessen the workload and enrich the facilitation process for you, they increase the facilitation expertise within your institution or organization. It would help a great deal if your colleague has already taken FLO Fundamentals.</li> <li><strong>Access your FLO Fundamentals learning environment to review content and tools</strong>.&nbsp;Prepare the course site or learning environment and (re)acquaint yourself with the facilitation tools you plan to use. Familiarize yourself with the course content, materials, philosophy, scheduling, flow, etc. of the course.</li> <li><strong>Set up a web conferencing tool for online synchronous sessions and conversations</strong>. There are many web conferencing applications to choose from, depending on your institution’s requirements.</li> <li><strong>Connect with your co-facilitator for detailed pre-planning</strong>.&nbsp;Develop a planning regime that you’re both comfortable with. Work together to develop a detailed list of tasks to be completed before, during, and after the course runs. You have a lot to do before the course begins: <ol><li>Ensure an easy-to-access place or process to store planning resources. Agree on planning tools and schedules.</li> <li>Customize this Facilitator Task List to fit your needs.</li> <li>Review the resources available in the OER and select some activities to try. You could also add your own ideas for icebreakers, discussion topics, resources, images, slides, etc.</li> <li>Develop rough agendas for your synchronous sessions.</li> <li>Prepare how-to resources for your participants to explain the features of the learning environments and tools.</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Practice using learning environment tools</strong>. If you’re already pretty comfortable with both synchronous and asynchronous online tools, you may wish to try something new; to model for your participants an adventurous open mind when it comes to educational technology. However, be aware of the technical expertise of your potential participants: you don’t want to choose something that most of them will have trouble accessing or learning to use.</li> <li><strong>Identify potential participants</strong>. Think about where you might find your course participants. Will you enlist from your institution only, or other institutions and organizations? Decide how far ahead you must start the recruitment process.</li> <li><strong>Ensure your content is accurate</strong>.&nbsp;Once you have a potential learner audience in mind, re-visit the learning environment and carefully review all content (forum post topics, reading lists, directions, etc.). Make sure your content is appropriate for your intended group of participants, and reflects the goals of your institution or program. Remember, the FLO courses have been developed as Open Educational Resources and are licenced under a <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/" data-url="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a> so you’re free to modify whatever you like! The only requirement is that you provide attribution and don’t imply or suggest endorsement by the licensor.</li> <li><strong>Ensure your content is <em>accurate</em>.</strong> Unfortunately, the web addresses (URLs) of internet resources change often with the result that your linked document may not appear when participants click on the link. Sometimes, through searching, you can locate the new URL for the resource but you may wish to consider finding a more up-to-date resource on the same topic instead.</li> <li>(If you haven’t done so already!) <strong>Choose a start date and promote</strong> your course to your target participants.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Your Technical Skills: The Least You Need to Know</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-251" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" title="" /></p> <p>Your participants may dream up a variety of&nbsp;designs for their&nbsp;mini-session and, ideally, you and your co-facilitator will be comfortable setting up the tools they need. If you are working within an LMS, some commonly-used tools include:</p> <ul><li>Forums or discussion groups: LMS-based forums usually offer many different settings and you should be familiar with most of them. Learn to set up both open forums and team-based forums (if available) and explore other settings that can create new possibilities for structuring activities.</li> <li>Polls or Choices: Many LMSs offer a tool for quickly polling participants — handy for any time you want people to indicate a preference (e.g. “what time should we meet for our synchronous session?”), or to vote on a single question.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <h2>One- to two weeks before the course begins</h2> <p>Once your FLO Fundamentals course is underway, you and your participants will be very busy indeed and you’ll want to have as much preparatory work out of the way as possible. How you set up the course site and engage the community will directly impact how the rest of the course flows; keep in mind that you are modelling good facilitation practices (a detailed list of Core FLO Facilitation Skills is included in <a class="internal" href="#chapter-facilitating-flo" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/facilitating-flo/">Chapter 3</a> of this Guide).</p> <ol><li><strong>Complete recruitment and register participants</strong>. You may have begun the recruitment of participants weeks or even months ahead. Make sure you have a process in place to register your participants in accordance with your institution’s policies. If you are managing your own site (e.g. a WordPress site), you may be able to organize this on your own. During recruitment, be sure to: <ol><li>Communicate expectations around time and teamwork.</li> <li>Provide information to your participants about what they’ll need to do and where to find what they’ll need.&nbsp;Your goal is not to overwhelm your participants but to provide enough information so they can jump right in when the course begins.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="97" height="97" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p><strong>What’s the right number of participants for this course?<br /> </strong>A small class of 10 or fewer participants will make it difficult to sustain rich online conversations. On the other hand, a large class of more than 25 may be more than 2 facilitators can handle. Our experience has shown that a class of 14 – 20 educators is a good size for this course.</p> </div> <ol><li value="2"><strong>Meet with co-facilitator</strong>, finalize the week ahead.&nbsp;Now is the time to check the details and do final revisions of your first week’s activities &amp; resources, including: <ol><li>Discussion topics, resources, images, slides, etc.</li> <li>Icebreaker activities.</li> <li>Your introductory welcome post.</li> <li>Agenda for the first synchronous session.</li> <li>Resource to explain the basic features of the synchronous environment &amp; tools.</li> </ol> </li> <li><strong>Create or update co-facilitators’ profiles</strong> and contact information.&nbsp;Tell a little about yourself in a profile or short biography. Establish your contact information and set “office hours” (if appropriate).</li> <li><strong>Decide which aspects of the course will be displayed</strong> when the course opens and which aspects will be hidden until needed. Many learning environments will let you hide or show specific activities until you’re ready for your participants to see them.</li> <li><strong>Ensure sufficient starting information for participants</strong>.&nbsp;Your new participants will need detailed information about how to access the course and get started (e.g. if using Moodle, see the FLO Handbook on the Hub tab, or consider preparing a screencast).</li> <li><strong>Finalize enrollment of participants</strong>, send out a&nbsp;Welcome email.&nbsp;Provide the participants with access to the course and/or information about accessing technical support, if necessary.</li> <li><strong>Decide on your week’s start day</strong> and modify your directions to the participants and the learning environment settings accordingly (if necessary). This course is not self-paced; the work is organized around weeks. Will the first day of your course week begin on a Sunday, Monday, or some other day?</li> <li><strong>Set a time for your first</strong> (Week 1) <strong>synchronous session</strong>. Prepare the synchronous environment as much as possible: upload slides, write/draw/embed a welcome message, etc.</li> <li><strong>Set up a separate online workspace for each team</strong>. You will be dividing up your participants into 4 teams; each team will facilitate one of the weekly mini-sessions. A unique team workspace (e.g. a forum or Google doc) with editing functions for team members should be sufficient. You may wish to limit access (e.g. read-only access) to this workspace to non-team participants.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><h2 class="textbox__title">Privacy and Confidentiality</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-251" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" title="" /></p> <p>In all FLO courses, our learning relies on the exchange of honest, constructive feedback, and we need to agree on rules that support this foundation of trust. Be aware of your institutional or organizational policies relating to privacy and confidentiality, determine how you will interpret these for your online learning environment, and decide how to communicate these rules to your participants. You can see an example of how privacy and confidentiality concerns are communicated in this page in the <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=15395&amp;chapterid=3013" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/mod/book/view.php?id=15395&amp;chapterid=3013">FLO Fundamentals Course Handbook</a>&nbsp;(in the Moodle OER). Some privacy and confidentiality rules you may wish to adopt:</p> <ul><li>Always seek permission to share content posted by participants.</li> <li>When using social media and other online services to complete activities, ensure you are familiar with the levels of privacy available and how the information will be stored and shared. Communicate this information to the participants.</li> <li>If you plan on recording your synchronous sessions, confirm that this is OK with the session participants <em>before</em> you hit the record button.</li> <li>Let participants know who else has access to this course (e.g. participants, facilitators, assistants, website administrators, etc.).</li> <li>You may wish to establish “<a href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vegas+Rule" data-url="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vegas+Rule">Vegas rules</a>,” i.e. what happens in the course, stays in the course.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <p>Some other decisions you’ll need to make:</p> <ol start="10"><li><strong>Decide which teams each co-facilitator will support</strong> during the course, and decide between yourselves what kind of support you will provide.</li> <li><strong>Confirm technical support</strong> is available and adequate, if needed. If you are providing your own tech support, confirm that your site has been backed up and no significant technical issues (e.g. scheduled downtime) exist. If tech support personnel are available, confirm they are standing by and aware of your course start date and enrollments.</li> <li><strong>Review the suggested assessment options for this course and select one (or more)</strong> to recommend for your participants. A self-assessment rubric can be adapted so the facilitator can assign a grade, if needed (see&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-fundamentals-self-assessment-rubric" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-fundamentals-self-assessment-rubric/">FLO Fundamentals Self-Assessment Rubric</a>).</li> </ol> <h2>As time permits</h2> <ul><li><strong>Practice navigating your course site and other tools.</strong> If you are using the OER Moodle version of this course, you’ll find it’s a complex environment with lots of moving parts. Take the time to familiarize yourself with the course and revise it as you see fit. Move stuff around and explore different tools, modules, and plugins (if available). Consider (judiciously!) trying some new or less-used tools outside of your LMS or main learning environment.</li> <li><strong>Streamline or otherwise improve your course’s navigation tools.</strong> When you refer to another part of your course or learning environment, provide a direct link whenever possible. Consider including a navigation screencast showing step-by-step how to get around your learning environment or LMS.</li> <li><strong>Fine-tune your reading list.</strong> In such a fascinating and fast-moving field like online facilitation, it’s easy to get carried away with the list of readings you provide for participants. Consider making all readings optional but don’t be afraid to strongly recommend a resource you know is important. After all, this course is intended to be informed by research and theory.</li> </ul> <p>The readings you’ll see contained in this course have been chosen carefully to be both high quality and of reasonable length. However, as we have already mentioned, links to internet-based resources can break or become “stale.” Encourage your FLO participants to research and recommend better or more up-to-date readings for their own facilitation week.</p> <h2>A few days before the course begins</h2> <ol><li><strong>Connect with your participants</strong>. Make sure they’re able to access the learning environment, and communicate some basic information about the course, expectations around time, etc.</li> <li><strong>Write your introductory welcome post</strong> (e.g. in an “Introductions” forum within the course or as a new thread in the “Open” forum) in a friendly, informal, and enthusiastic style that welcomes them to the online course environment and sets a tone for your online community. Encourage participants to respond with their own introductions.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><h2 class="textbox__title">Your Welcome post doesn’t have to be just text…</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-251" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" title="" /></p> <p>As a facilitator of FLO, you’ll want to set an example from the beginning of what good facilitation looks like.

Part of your job as facilitator is to model an attitude of fearless experimentation with communication technologies. What about a video introduction against a backdrop of where you live?

Of course, you don’t want to intimidate your participants if they’re fairly novice technology users, so be sure to offer choices.</li> <li>What to include is up to you; this is your first impression. You might like to talk a bit about your teaching and other professional experience. You could share an anecdote or advice from your own online facilitation experience, or use an icebreaker-type format.</li> <li>Make sure your post sets a good impression: establishes instructor presence, presents a clear message without being too long or too short.</li> <li>Be sure your introductory post ends with an invitation for your participants to share their introductions in a similar way.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <ol><li value="3"><strong>Post the week’s overview post</strong>, emphasizing for participants: <ol><li>Activities, etc. they must complete this week.</li> <li>Tips on how to navigate the site.</li> <li>The need to plan and schedule time to work on the course.

Seeing the FLO online community beginning to develop and learning of participants helping each other is motivating and rewarding. However, one of my “imaginary facilitator friends” known as Anxious Annie has a habit of showing up in Week 1 and hanging around. She keeps asking me, “What about those who haven’t posted by the suggested timeline? What about those who haven’t started working on their week’s planning yet? What about those who haven’t posted their journal yet?” Then, I remember facilitating is not about me; it’s about helping the participants as they need and ask for help. There is a saying that RRU folks often refer to called “Trust the process.” As I gain more experience and confidence with facilitating, the more I am able to trust the process and ignore Annie. Besides, it’s only 5:00 Sunday afternoon. There is lots of time left…</p> <p>A question that faced me this week was, “What do you do when a team member leaves the team/course (for whatever reason)?” and “How do you best support the team member who is left to facilitate that week’s activities?”</p> <p>Out of confusion comes clarity,</p> <p>Leonne</p> </div> </div> <ol><li value="3"><strong>Ensure the Diversity of Learners team is ready</strong> for the week ahead.

These are before the activity, during the activity, just after the activity, and then in response to their FLIF. Now, before the activity, as their FLO facilitator being assigned to support their team, I try to let them know what they are supposed to be doing, but I try not to be too heavy-handed in how to do it or all of the minute details of what they’re going to be up to and how they’re going to share their roles. So, I let them know I’m a support to them, but I try not to direct too much what they’re going to be doing.</p> <p>After they launch their activity, I watch how things are going throughout the week as their support facilitator, and sometimes I’ll post in their planning forum to ask some open-ended questions about how they think things are going, and maybe if they think something else needs to be done by them in order to prompt the group or to spur the group on to participate a little bit more in the activity. Again, I try not to be too heavy-handed here, but I do watch and try to ask questions to help the team facilitate behind the scenes as we go along.</p> <p>Now the facilitation team always asks for feedback at the end of the week from the rest of the group, and they do this through the feedback structures that we’ve provided in FLO. We’ve tried to use different structures every week, so we can show the class just how to use different feedback structures. So, the team, or one of us as FLO facilitators, will ask the rest of the group to provide feedback to that team. The team needs this feedback in order to complete their FLIF reflection activity. So we always really want to encourage the rest of the class to do this and provide meaningful feedback to the facilitating team.</p> <p>The last way the team gets feedback on their facilitation is individually through the FLIF reflection tool. So, after each person on that team has had a chance to complete the FLIF, then I as their support facilitator will go in, individually, and respond to those pieces in the FLIF. Again, I try to be positive here, but I do try to bring up things that maybe they could have done differently or suggest alternatives. It almost becomes like a little conversation in the FLIF about how things could have gone if they had done something different, and also giving them kudos for what they did that I saw that was going really well. I always invite the person, individually, to contact me after they’ve seen my comments in their FLIF to get even more feedback if they want to talk about something that I’ve said.</p> <p>So, those are some ways that a team gets feedback in FLO, and I wish you luck in supporting them to have that.

When you click on your Week 3 tab – voila! – after the Week 3 overview information you’ll see a video from Daniel welcoming you to this activity. There is a case to read and the text has been modified in the forum to give you everything you need to start. You will be working on a team so do check in today to see what you need to begin.</p> <p>Also coming up this week we have a synchronous Collaborate session at 7pm on Thursday night Pacific time. Sylvia and I will be co-facilitating that session and we’d like to invite you to do two small things in preparation for it:</p> <ul><li>Think about your answer to this question: “What opportunities do you see to make changes to or begin your facilitation practice, as a result of what you’ve learned in this course so far?”</li> <li>What facilitation-related questions do you have cropping up for you that you haven’t gotten answered yet?</li> </ul> <p>This is an optional but recommended session and it will be interactive (we’re going to try a <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/" data-url="http://www.liberatingstructures.com/">Liberating Structure</a>) so try to show up a little early to check your technology so we can get going on time. Thank you!</p> <p>Lastly, thanks to everyone who gave feedback to the Orange team for last week’s facilitation. This feedback from you to the facilitating team each week is imperative for them to be able to reflect well on their facilitation, fill out their FLIF and of course enhance their facilitation practice overall.</p> <p>Looking forward to our discussions this week!</p> <p>Beth and Sylvia</p> </div> </div> <h3>Early in the week</h3> <ol><li><strong>Notify participants about Week 3’s synchronous session</strong>.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-the-flif-facilitation-process" title="The FLIF Facilitation Process"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">8</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">The FLIF Facilitation Process</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>The FLIF (Feel, Like, Improve, Feedback) survey is a valuable way to help your participant facilitation teams debrief their facilitation experience. As each team completes their facilitation week, you can strongly encourage them to complete the 6-question FLIF survey (see below). You can assist the team with this reflection by modelling the FLIF process yourself.</p> <p>The questions posed in the FLIF are:</p> <ol><li>How do I feel about the session? Reflect on the strategies you used to facilitate and their impact on participants. Do you feel participants achieved the learning outcomes? How do you know?</li> <li>What do I like about what I did?<br /> Think about the aspects of your mini-session that you felt good about.</li> <li>What do I want to improve or do differently?<br /> Consider what you would like to do better next time you are in a facilitation role like this.</li> <li>What were the key points about the feedback I received from my participants about my facilitation?<br /> Review the feedback you received from your participants. What conclusions can you synthesize? What are the take-away ideas you’ll want to consider for next time?</li> <li>How will this facilitation experience impact my teaching?<br /> What will you take away from this experience that you can apply to your own courses?</li> <li>Are there some additional points I would like feedback on?<br /> Are there any specific aspects of your facilitation experience you’d like your course facilitators to respond to?</li> </ol> <p>The survey can be developed using a semi-structured survey tool (e.g. an LMS quiz), or in a less-structured way (email or private forum).</p> <p>When team participants have completed the FLIF, be sure to provide them with timely and constructive feedback, and encourage them to respond to their own team feedback in a similar way. Conclude your response with an open invitation for the participant to contact you with any questions about your feedback, or any related topics they wished to discuss with you.</p> <h1>Explanatory notes for participant facilitators</h1> <p>A strong element of the FLO Fundamentals course is critical reflection. Throughout the course, you are asked to pause, take note, examine, look forward. When you complete your mini-­session facilitation, we ask that you complete a reflective survey activity referred to as FLIF, in which you structure your reflections around how you <em>Felt</em>, what you <em>Liked</em>, how you might <em>Improve</em>, and how you might incorporate any <em>Feedback</em> you received. Your FLIF responses should be honest and personal; they are shared only with course co-facilitators.</p> <p>Although FLIF responses are generally private, we offer you two examples below of how others have responded to the FLIF questions:</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>FLIF: Facilitator 1’s responses</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-744" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-300x297.png" alt="Magnifying glass icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-300x297.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-768x760.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-1536x1520.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-2048x2026.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-225x223.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-350x346.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p><strong>Question 1: How do I feel about the session? Reflect on the strategies you used to facilitate and their impact on participants. Do you feel participants achieved the learning outcomes? How do you know?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I feel good about the activity we developed although we’ve had a few hiccups along the way (not unexpected). We had a dual purpose for this mini­session – not only did we want to guide the participants in an exploration of the opportunities and challenges faced by adult learners online, but we also wanted to clearly demonstrate the process of facilitating a mini­-session in FLO. I’d say we were successful in the 2nd but not, perhaps, as successful in the 1st. Based on the feedback and the summaries and the one reflective response I’ve seen so far, not everyone has accomplished the trickiest part we were trying to help them achieve.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. What do I like about what I did? Think about the aspects of your mini-session that you felt good about.</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I think we did well in terms of modelling the process­, and sharing our planning session debates/ideas, including the difficult task of dividing up the workload. I think the GoogleDocs worked well.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. What do I want to improve or do differently? Consider what you would like to do better next time you are in a facilitation role like this.</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I think I would try to find a different way to encourage more discussion between team members; I feel that the way we structured the group work meant there wasn’t a real crystallization of ideas within each group. It seemed to be more of a sharing of individual responses to the questions. I also think that I wouldn’t double­-post the milestone date in the instructions and in the Events Calendar. Made for too much work and difficult to change both places when we had to flex the timeline.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. What were the key points about the feedback I received from my participants about my facilitation? Review the feedback you received your participants. What conclusions can you synthesize? What are the take- away ideas you’ll want to consider for next time?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Not all the feedback has been posted yet but, from what was there, participants found the instructions clear and the activity worthwhile.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. How will this facilitation experience impact my teaching? What will you take away from this experience that you can apply to your own courses?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Demonstrating a mini-­session was a great way to make me more aware of how/why I do the things I do — ­ that metacognitive perspective is really powerful. Sometimes when I facilitate on my own, I don’t take the time to reflect on the “why” and “what for” questions. I’ll put up “Post­-its” on my bulletin board to remind me in the future.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Are there some additional points I would like feedback on? Are there any specific aspects of your facilitation experience you’d like your course facilitators to respond to?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Not that I can think of at this time. Thanks!</p></blockquote> </div> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>FLIF: Facilitator 2’s responses</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-744" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-300x297.png" alt="Magnifying class icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-300x297.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-1024x1013.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-768x760.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-1536x1520.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-2048x2026.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-225x223.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour-350x346.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p><strong>1. How do I feel about the session? Reflect on the strategies you used to facilitate and their impact on participants. Do you feel participants achieved the learning outcomes? How do you know?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I feel that the activity went fairly smoothly and that participants achieved the learning outcomes. I do like to balance things out in an online course so that some weeks aren’t high volume on the forum posts and too chock full of synchronous activities. However, this week felt very quiet. Then late in the week (and weekend) when the summaries were posted I felt very reassured that things were coming together. So I think it was just a little facilitator angst because by all reports people were very engaged — it just wasn’t as visible.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>2. What do I like about what I did? Think about the aspects of your mini-session that you felt good about.</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I like that the instructions were clear enough that everything managed to just get on with it. I was delighted to see how quickly everyone signed up for their team groups. During our planning, Facilitator 1 and I focused on keeping everything very streamlined without too many layers. Group work is already a huge layer that requires a lot of time for coordination! I think we achieved that. I also like how group summaries, as a way of sharing back, can really highlight important aspects of the reading as well as individual experiences.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>3. What do I want to improve or do differently? Consider what you would like to do better next time you are in a facilitation role like this.</strong></p> <blockquote><p>I’m always hesitant to mess with the timeline set out at the beginning of an activity. There are so many demands on our time as educators, so it shouldn’t be a surprise when some people can’t quite squeeze in what they need to do by the published date. The important thing is that delays and struggles are communicated to all participants. Having said that, we did make a decision to shift the completion dates and times to accommodate one team group. When I review everything more closely now, I don’t think I would have done the same thing. For one, asking everyone to attend to new admin details adds noise to the workshop right when everyone is focused in on their projects. Also, I remember what it’s like to be on the receiving end of deadline shifting and having mixed feelings about it (Now that I have more time should I spend more time?) Plus as a facilitator, it was a bit of a scramble to adjust dates in the calendar and elsewhere.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>4. What were the key points about the feedback I received from my participants about my facilitation? Review the feedback you received your participants. What conclusions can you synthesize? What are the take- away ideas you’ll want to consider for next time?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>The feedback is still rolling in. I love that people noticed what didn’t happen (glitches, confusion about what to do, etc.) and that they felt supported. Alignment of the activity with the learning outcomes was also noticed. This is a bonus because that observation is in itself a learning outcome : )</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>5. How will this facilitation experience impact my teaching? What will you take away from this experience that you can apply to your own courses?</strong></p> <blockquote><p>Most of my current work is related to helping others learn how to facilitate. This mini­-session had a dual purpose — the topic itself (adult learners online) and modelling a mini­-session for the upcoming weeks. One struggle with FLO has been finding the best way to convey the expectations and (flexible) possibilities of facilitating a mini­-session. I’m excited about the potential of this format for future FLO workshops.</p></blockquote> <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>6. Are there some additional points I would like feedback on?

During the course, facilitators can expect to spend approximately 15 hours per week, potentially more in the first week and in the fourth week (due to organizing and hosting the showcase sessions). First-time hosts may require more time. Facilitators should expect to be available to the course on a daily basis.</p> <p><strong>Expectations – Participants</strong>: &nbsp;Participants are expected to participate actively and collaboratively throughout each week, exploring design ideas, developing their online unit designs, and participating in weekly Studio sessions to give and receive constructive feedback.</p> <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: &nbsp;Participants are encouraged to use a self-assessment FLO Design rubric, augmented by a selected quality framework, to monitor their developing skills and their design project. Weekly Studio sessions provide opportunities for the FLO Facilitator (and peers) to provide constructive feedback on the evolving designs.</p> <p><strong>Estimated Time Required for Participants</strong>: Participants should expect to spend approximately 6-8 hours for course activities during each of the four weeks. Those with no prior online teaching and learning experiences can expect to invest more time. Additional time may be needed to prepare for the final showcase sessions.</p> <p><strong>Primary Resource for Facilitators</strong>: All materials for the FLO Design course are included in an <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=25" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=25">Open Educational Resource (OER) from BCcampus</a>, available for viewing or download. This guide is based on the 2019 version of the course.</p> <h1>What is FLO Design?</h1> <p>Facilitating Learning Online Design (FLO Design) is a four-week course that offers participants opportunities to explore different approaches to developing effective online courses and/or learning experiences. Participants are introduced to a wide range of ideas about how people learn, best practices and recommended pedagogies to engage and support online learners, and several respected quality and accessibility frameworks to guide their design efforts.</p> <p>The course is practical and developmental; participants are asked to identify a specific design project and can work alone or with others to design a short unit of learning (unit = 2-3 weeks of an online course or equivalent) and a sample online learning activity to demonstrate how they will engage learners online.</p> <h1>More details</h1> <p>Although all FLO courses emphasize reflective practices and participatory, often collaborative, learning with a practical focus, FLO Design goes a step further by building in weekly Studio design forums. FLO Facilitators offer expert advice and suggestions, but also acknowledge the diverse range of skills and experiences that learners bring and invite them to help each other clarify and develop their design projects.</p> <h1>Learning outcomes</h1> <p>After participating in, and contributing to, learning activities throughout FLO Design, you should be able to:</p> <ul><li>Discuss important elements of online learning design, including quality, accessibility and design guidelines.</li> <li>Create a plan for a short unit of online learning that includes a prototype learning activity.</li> <li>Critically reflect on your learning and progress in developing online learning design skills and knowledge.</li> <li>Explain design choices and pedagogical perspectives applied to a specific learning design project.</li> </ul> <h1>Participants</h1> <p>Participants who take FLO Design are typically new online course designers/instructors and/or experienced instructional/learning designers, as well as instructors and program/course planners. The course offers participants an opportunity to review the theory and practice of online learning and teaching, to explore different design approaches and quality frameworks, and to practice important planning and design skills.</p> <h1>Technology</h1> <p>General recommendations for technology can be found in in Chapter 3: Tools to Support FLO.</p> <p>Some additional tools to consider for this course:</p> <ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">Provide suggestions for drawing or charting tools that participants can use to create a visual of their design to share with others.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Provide access to a shared collaborative space such as Google Docs for both facilitator and participant use.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">An annotation tool can be helpful to allow specific comments to be linked to the relevant portion of the design plan (e.g., Marginalia within Moodle forums).</li> </ul> <h1>The course content and layout</h1> <p>The FLO Design Open Learning Resource (OER) from BCcampus is a complete four-week course with a comprehensive collection of design readings and resources and learning activities. Within the OER course on the SCoPE site, resources are organized into tabbed pages. The core structure includes tabbed pages for:</p> <ul><li>the Hub</li> <li>Pre-Course Orientation (optional)</li> <li>Week 1: Getting Started</li> <li>Week 2: Sparks to Design</li> <li>Week 3: Projects Under Construction</li> <li>Week 4: Showcase Designs</li> </ul> <h2>The Hub</h2> <p>The Hub contains content/activities that are referred to throughout the course, such as:</p> <ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Acknowledgements.</strong> You may choose to embed acknowledgements of funders or contributors, or recognize traditional territories (increasingly done in BC, Yukon and other parts of Canada).<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="762-1"></span></span></li> <li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Course handbook.</strong> Similar to a course syllabus, the handbook explains how the course is designed and the kind of teaching and learning to expect. In addition, the Handbook includes a rubric to guide self-assessment, tips to help participants track progress and an explanation of course licensing and access.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-740" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-256x300.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-256x300.png 256w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-875x1024.png 875w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-768x899.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-1313x1536.png 1313w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-1750x2048.png 1750w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-65x76.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-225x263.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-350x410.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>Before offering FLO courses, you may find it helpful to refer to your institution’s policies on privacy and confidentiality in terms of online courses and participant privacy.</p> <p>FLO courses are built on a model that relies on collaboration and honest, constructive exchanges to help all participants learn and develop. Facilitators and participants should discuss the expectation and importance of privacy.</p> <p>Some privacy and confidentiality rules you may wish to adopt:</p> <ul><li>Always seek permission to share content posted by participants.</li> <li>When using social media and other online services to complete activities, ensure you are familiar with the levels of privacy available and how the information will be stored and shared. Communicate this information to the participants.</li> <li>Let participants know who else has access to this course (e.g. participants, facilitators, assistants, website administrators, etc.).</li> <li>You may wish to establish <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vegas+Rule" data-url="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Vegas+Rule">Vegas rules</a>, i.e., what happens in the course, stays in the course.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <ul><li><strong>Course schedule.</strong> A detailed, week-by-week explanation of learning events and tasks to help participants stay on track.</li> <li><strong>Announcements and open forums.</strong> The Announcements forum is a place for facilitators to share important course notices, while the Open forum is an informal space where participants are encouraged to post questions or ideas.</li> <li><strong>Weekly Reflections forum.</strong> Participants are asked to respond to a reflective question each week and their posts are gathered in the Hub.</li> <li><strong>FAQs – Tech Tips and Tools.</strong> A searchable collection of help items and tutorials.</li> <li><strong>Visuals Gallery.</strong> Visuals that explain some core learning activities and demonstrate mapping learning designs.</li> <li><strong>HIDDEN resources.</strong> These are for Facilitators only. They may include a private discussion forum, a folder to store documents and presentations to customize for weekly synchronous sessions, etc. It can be useful to embed a page listing the changes being made to the course content prior to (and sometimes during) the course delivery.</li> </ul> <h2>Weekly tabbed pages</h2> <p>Each week’s pages include at least the following:</p> <ul><li>A detailed, editable checklist,</li> <li>A topic-focused overview book of readings and resources,</li> <li>A studio forum to support collaborative design work, and</li> <li>A link to the Weekly Reflections forum (contained in the Hub).</li> </ul> <p>Note: If you decide to offer a pre-course orientation, you’ll add a tabbed page that contains resources and activities to help participants navigate the online course and complete essential tasks.</p> <h2>A studio-based design approach</h2> <p>A unique aspect of the FLO Design course is the use of weekly collaborative Studio forums to encourage participants to share their emerging designs and to review constructive feedback provided by the FLO Facilitators (and contributed by other participants).</p> <p>Participants contribute questions, thoughts, emerging designs, examples, and provide feedback to the work of their colleagues in the course. Each week’s Studio forum provides a quick reminder of design tasks.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Example: Week 2 studio forum</h2> <div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_511" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-511" style="width: 197px"><img class="wp-image-511 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image4-2crop.jpg" alt="A sculpture of a person helping someone climb a building" width="197" height="277" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-511">Figure 5.1</div></div> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-237" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour.png" alt="Magnifying glass icon" width="100" height="99" title="" /></p> <p>The weekly studio forums are a place where you can share your progress, your questions, your challenges with others.</p> <p>For this second week of FLO-Design, we ask that <strong>you post a topic thread</strong> indicating:</p> <ul><li>your chosen instructional (learning) design approach (see the Week 2: Overview book),</li> <li>any elements from Instruction (Learning) Design stories shared in the synchronous Blackboard Collaborate session that <strong>you plan to integrate</strong></li> <li>an update on your progress in developing your Design Project Plan</li> <li>the drawing tool you’ve selected to illustrate parts of your plan (or an alternative visual method to share your emerging design)</li> <li>any questions you have about how to move forward?!</li> </ul> <p>Please take the time to review and respond to at least two other posts in the Studio Forum.</p> </div> </div> <h1>Assessment of learning</h1> <p>FLO Design offers a developmental learning opportunity; there are no marks or grading for design projects and participation.</p> <p>Participants monitor their own progress in relation to the FLO Design Learning Outcomes using the self-assessment rubric (included in the Course Handbook) AND by reviewing the detailed feedback from FLO Facilitators on their emerging learning design each week in the Studio forums.</p> <p>The rubric uses five criteria and a three-stage developmental structure: Level 1: Beginning; Level 2: Developing; Level 3: Accomplished. You can review the detailed elements for each criterion in the example shared at the end of this chapter (see&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-design-self-assessment-rubric" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-design-self-assessment-rubric/">FLO Design Self-Assessment Rubric</a>).</p> <p>FLO Facilitators provide constructive feedback based on each participants’ stated design goals, and they are also guided by a course quality framework (see Week 3 Overview, Elements of Quality).</p> <p>A final self-assessment activity in Week 4 encourages participants to reflect on and share their progress and to look forward to how they will apply what they’ve learned.</p> <h1>Facilitator task list: What you need to do before, during, and after the course</h1> <p>The successful hosting of FLO Design requires an organized approach to planning and facilitation. A detailed facilitator task list has been developed for co-facilitators to support a successful delivery of the course.</p> <p>See the&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-design-task-list" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-design-task-list/">FLO Design Task List</a>&nbsp;to review the detailed facilitator tasks alongside the following explanations.</p> <h2>Before the course begins</h2> <p>Review the FLO Design Handbook and Schedule (in the Hub page): The Handbook and Schedule will help you understand the curriculum and intended flow of learning in the course.&nbsp;Spend some time and reflect on your facilitation approach and how you will manage the weekly Studio forums described in the Handbook.</p> <p>Review each week’s Overview book to ensure that the content reflects your institution’s guidelines and parameters related to online course design. For example, if you have specific accessibility checklists, design standards, or policies related to inclusive design or Indigenization, these should be added to the course.</p> <h3>Design Choices</h3> <p>Do you want to offer a pre-course orientation week?</p> <ul><li>Consider your participants, particularly their previous experience with your chosen online learning environment and tools.

FLO courses integrate structures to promote both individual and collaborative reflective practice.</p> <p>We ask participants to keep a personal learning journal to track their understanding, their “aha” moments, and their ongoing questions and responses to theories and ideas presented during the course. We also ask them to share nuggets or a brief synopsis each week in a collaborative forum so they can learn from each other and engage in further exploration and critical thinking.</p> <p>The OER of FLO Design uses a different approach to try to deepen the level of reflection and to encourage more meaningful discussions. Each week, a facilitator would pose a “thought” question to direct each participant’s attention to a core concept or important theory/practice. Then they ask participants to NOT question or comment on each other’s reflective posts; instead, they asked participants to pursue relevant reflections within the Studio forums so the discussions could directly inform/improve the emerging designs.</p> <p>Each approach has potential benefits; choose what you believe will be of most benefit to your participants.</p> </div> </div> <p>Do you need to offer starter ideas for design projects or do you want to rely on the design challenges presented by your participants?</p> <ul><li>Review the topics and resources offered in the Week 1 Design Project book. You can customize the topics and resources or omit the book and rely on your participants.</li> </ul> <p>Do you have a back-pocket full of stories of instructional or learning design strategies you can share or do you have colleagues who are interested in sharing? How will you “spark” new ideas or inspire participants to reflect on their projects and intended approach?</p> <ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">Look ahead to the Week 2 Sparks to Design Forum and plan how you will find/share stories of instructional/learning designs to inspire participants.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-227" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour.png" alt="Quote icon" width="100" height="86" title="" /></p> <p>In one version of FLO Design we invited several instructional/learning designers to share a story of an interesting design project. The facilitators (we called them “explainers”) participated in the Week 2 Sparks synchronous session and shared some slides as they described their design and pointed out what they learned about designing from the experience.The explainers also agreed to participate asynchronously by responding to questions about their stories in the Sparks forum. Some of the explainers were able to share their story for the OER; others couldn’t due to confidentiality considerations.</p> <p>Feedback:&nbsp; <em>“The Collaborate sessions, especially the Explainers with the attached forum, was very useful.

Follow up immediately with any latecomers by offering support and encouragement. &nbsp;Emphasize the importance of getting the essentials accomplished in the first week (see Week 1 checklist).</p> <p>Posting a detailed summary of design projects at the end of the first week can help participants get a sense of the breadth of experience and ideas within the learning community. Making this visible can reduce the stress many participants feel when they are asked to choose a project and can help develop a stronger sense of community. Here is a simple example:</p> <table style="width: 100%;"><caption>Summary of Design Projects</caption> <tbody><tr><th scope="col">Name</th> <th scope="col">Topic-Type</th> <th scope="col">Intended Learners</th> <th scope="col">Willing to Collaborate?</th> </tr> <tr><td>Albert</td> <td>Re-useable module that focuses on group problem-solving and self-assessment of solutions</td> <td>Physics students</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr><td>Barbara</td> <td>2 options: &nbsp;Orientation to English Language Studies or Intercultural Competency</td> <td>1st year students of English Language Studies</td> <td>–</td> </tr> <tr><td>Brenda</td> <td>Improve online portion of an existing Intro to Chemistry course</td> <td>Chemistry students</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr><td>Catherine</td> <td>Blended report writing for Justice</td> <td>Students in Justice (all have undergrad)</td> <td>–</td> </tr> <tr><td>Frank</td> <td>Module for PIDP curriculum development course – accessibility to online learning</td> <td>Adult learners, some instructors</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> <tr><td>Gary</td> <td>2 options: Research Ethics or English (Close Reading)</td> <td>Diverse learners</td> <td>Yes</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3>Week 2: Sparks to design</h3> <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Step back a little this week and encourage participants to connect and continue building a sense of community and shared purpose.</p> <p>Use your forum posts to draw attention to important learning theories or approaches to learning design that are relevant to emerging design choices that participants share in the weekly Studio forum.</p> <p>By the end of Week 2, participants should have selected a specific design approach (three approaches are offered in the Week 2 Overview).</p> <p>Provide options for learning more (or reviewing) important concepts in online learning design.</p> <p>Add comments to forum discussions to draw attention to relevant theories or add links to more information.</p> <p>Provide complex ideas in structured ways or use digital tools to allow participants to explore easily. The Week 2&nbsp;<a href="https://prezi.com/" data-url="https://prezi.com/">Prezi</a> overview is an example of this – <a href="https://prezi.com/xbselyqlsmzd/?token=927d1d437b62a66b40cd75dfb4799bc0a69a4d36e1816c7d4e115d3922831bf6&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share" data-url="https://prezi.com/xbselyqlsmzd/?token=927d1d437b62a66b40cd75dfb4799bc0a69a4d36e1816c7d4e115d3922831bf6&amp;utm_campaign=share&amp;utm_medium=copy&amp;rc=ex0share">Design for Learning</a></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-758" style="width: 652px"><img class="wp-image-126 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image8-1.png" alt="A screenshot of a presentation in Prezi" width="652" height="524" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.3</div></div> <p><strong>Second synchronous session</strong>: The purpose of this session is to spark new ideas and encourage participants to think beyond their previous approaches to learning design. Be prepared with interesting examples (and guest presenters, if possible) to broaden the discussions.</p> <p><strong>Two key discussion forums</strong>: Make sure participants notice the purpose of both the weekly Studio forum (for posting on their specific projects) AND the Sparks forum (to host a discussion about the learning design examples provided by the explainers).</p> <p>The stories and examples shared during the Week 2 synchronous session should be summarized in the Sparks forum so participants can ask further questions during the week. These examples can encourage participants to try new approaches, and to think about their own design choices and how they may affect the learners.</p> <p>Monitor progress carefully and encourage participants to use the checklists and/or other methods to stay on track. Use nudge posts near the end of the week if participants haven’t identified an approach from the three shared in the Week 2 Overview book.</p> <p><strong>Make explicit links from emerging designs to theories and approaches</strong>: Focus on conversations in the Studio forum. Make sure you provide each participant with detailed, constructive feedback on their emerging design plan. Remember to draw in relevant theories and brief explanations of underlying values and beliefs about how people learn.</p> <h3>Week 3: Projects under construction</h3> <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Your facilitation this week will be both broad and deep! Connect with any participants who seem to be struggling while celebrating the “aha” design moments and accomplishments occurring in the weekly Studio. Take your feedback to deeper levels, making specific links between your comments and the FLO Design rubric, relevant learning or design theories or quality guidelines. Always keep the discussions learner-focused by asking questions from this perspective, based on each participant’s original context and learner descriptions.</p> <p>Maintain your emphasis on participatory and connected learning. Highlight thoughtful comments or questions posed by participants. Encourage any participants who haven’t provided feedback to their peers to do so.</p> <p>Encourage participants to develop a visual representation of design projects to help make the flow of each unit easier for reviewers to understand. Highlight any examples that participants have shared in the weekly Studio forum.</p> <p><strong>Third synchronous session</strong>: The purpose this session is to help participants overcome any significant challenges in the construction of their unit of learning. Allow time to discuss the purpose of developing a prototype online learning activity. Make sure participants understand that the prototype should reflect their beliefs about how people learn, and help them try out a particular approach or topic while they have a supportive audience who can provide valuable feedback.</p> <p><strong>Stay calm and carry on</strong>: Find ways to lessen the anxiety that some of your participants may be feeling this week. The pace of Week 3 can be hectic as participants are asked to sign up for a Showcase synchronous presentation in Week 4, to continue developing their units of learning, and to develop a prototype learning activity.</p> <p>Be open to modifying your approach/expectations to adapt to the needs of your cohort. The purpose is to help them develop, NOT to create a “do-or-die” atmosphere.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Why should I draw or map my design?</h2> <p><img class="alignleft wp-image-740" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-256x300.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-256x300.png 256w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-875x1024.png 875w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-768x899.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-1313x1536.png 1313w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-1750x2048.png 1750w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-65x76.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-225x263.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour-350x410.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>The power of images or drawings to make difficult concepts easier to understand has been researched and demonstrated for many years in education. For a short online learning experience like FLO Design where participants are asked to share their ideas and provide constructive feedback, some form of visual or illustration of the core activities and learning approach for each design project becomes important.</p> <p>The design of each project is changing each week. In addition, the underlying reasons for particular activities, assessment, and approaches are explained in lengthy paragraphs in Studio topic threads. A simple drawing or flowchart can allow participants and facilitators to quickly grasp the overall design and ask cogent questions or provide useful suggestions.</p> </div> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-75" style="width: 507px"><img class="wp-image-127 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image9-1.png" alt="A visual map of a Design FLO course that shows the relationship between modules, learning outcomes, resources, and activities" width="507" height="805" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text">Figure 5.4 Sample Participant Map</div></div> </div> <p><strong>Managing the clarity of Studio design posts</strong>: Not all participants will recognize the importance of linking back to a core design document and using each week’s Studio forum to post new design thinking or responses to constructive feedback. You can scaffold the process by creating links or inserting explanatory posts that encourage each participant to explain their thinking and highlight changes in their designs from week-to-week.</p> <p>Post separate summaries that highlight significant changes you observe in the group’s emerging designs. Identify themes and interesting streams of conversations within the week’s Studio.</p> <p><strong>Encourage peer-to-peer feedback</strong>: Find ways to elicit more meaningful posts; don’t accept “that’s great” superficial responses.</p> <p><strong>Promote the value of the Showcase sessions</strong>: As you encourage participants to sign up for Week 4 showcase session(s), mention the value of concise sharing of design ideas. In general, each participant will have a maximum of 10-15 minutes.</p> <p>Point out examples from elevator pitches or three-minute thesis presentations to show how this skill applies in business and academic fields.</p> <p>Point participants to the Week 4 Overview for tips on how to plan their presentations.</p> <h3>Week 4: Showcase designs</h3> <p><strong>Focus</strong>: Your facilitation this week may involve all your managerial, coordination and inspirational skills. You need to support participants to pull together a final presentation of their design, while asking them to take time to reflect on their experiences and share some of their intended future applications of what they’ve learned. And you want them to participate in a final closing activity and complete a course evaluation survey.</p> <p>Take time to collect examples, quotes, vignettes from participants to share during a final closing session – whether that be synchronous or a final open bulletin board or video, or simply a final forum posting.</p> <p><strong>Showcase session(s)</strong>: Depending on the size of your group, you may schedule more than one Showcase synchronous session. We recommend keeping them to the standard one hour format and allowing only 4-5 presentations per session (to allow time for brief questions and feedback). Remind participants to post their slides, diagrams or visuals of their design and prototype learning activity in the final Studio forum. They can add further explanations or ideas there. Emphasize the importance of having other participants take on the role of the audience to support their peers.</p> <p>Provide an example and a simple process to encourage those who can’t attend to create and share a screencast or audio recording that explains the final design they are asked to share in the Week 4 Studio forum.</p> <p><strong>Facilitator(s) and peer feedback</strong>: Facilitator(s) will have provided detailed formative feedback and suggestions/questions throughout each week. The final week’s feedback should include a summary and any final observations from the Showcase sessions. Acknowledge the progress each participant has made in designing and explaining their unit of learning to identify areas for growth and to encourage participants to reflect on their initial and future goals for developing and applying their learning design skills.</p> <p>Encourage participants to take time to review as many final designs as they can and to provide constructive feedback.</p> <p>You may choose to provide both open and private feedback to your participants for the end of the course. Make sure you refer to the criterion identified in the FLO Design rubric – the relevant learning outcomes and the quality guidelines.</p> <p><strong>Final reflective activity</strong>: Encourage participants to complete the final Looking Back/Looking Forward activity. Draw attention to the previous week’s reflections forum in the Hub and remind them of thought-provoking comments or ideas that were shared during Studio sessions.</p> <p><strong>Closing the course</strong>: An important facilitator role is to draw the course to a close and celebrate learning, connections and accomplishments. If possible, a synchronous celebration provides many opportunities for final discussions and acknowledgements. However, an asynchronous bulletin board or other online space to share final goodbyes can work as well.</p> <p>During the final week, FLO facilitators will often draw the course to a close with an activity that encourages participants to take a deep breath and reflect on their learning and to think ahead to how they might use what they’ve learned in the future.</p> <p>This example shows how the activity is structured and shows the use of annotated, opened licensed images and a cloud-based tool to provide an alternate way of presenting the activity.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Example of a learning activity</h2> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-512 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/giraffes.png" alt="Two giraffes.

As you flip through your learning journal or review your weekly Reflections-forum postings, what still resonates?</p> <p>Did you notice a pattern in the way you participated? What engaged you? What confused you?</p> <h3 style="text-align: left;"><strong>Looking forward</strong></h3> <p>And add a forward perspective – looking ahead, how do you see yourself applying what you’ve learned? Can you identify new challenges in online design you’d like to explore?</p> <p><strong>Describe at least one specific objective for your future instructional (learning) design work</strong>.</p> <p><strong>What steps do you plan to take to ensure that you “make it so”?</strong></p> <p>We call this activity “Looking Back, Looking Forward” (borrowed from the FLO foundation workshop) and encourage you to try different ways of sharing your final reflections.</p> <p>Try to post as early as you can so that you can read and enjoy others’ posts.</p> <p>Here’s an example of a different way to provide the instruction for this final activity – build in Microsoft Sawy.</p> <p><em>Navigate to the following link to launch then scroll down to follow the story.</em></p> <p><a href="https://sway.office.com/06v4nHYxKEbvumAp" data-url="https://sway.office.com/06v4nHYxKEbvumAp">Reflections &amp; Horizons (of FLO-Design)</a></p> </div> </div> <p>The final challenge is to try and host a synchronous celebration of learning to close the course. Although valuable for cementing relationships and potential future connections for learning, you may have to consider an asynchronous, digital goodbye.</p> <h2>Post-course</h2> <p>Participants often feel let down at the end of such intense learning. Consider some options to continue the connection, if possible. Leave part of the course space open so participants can report back on their success or further improvements to their design.</p> <ul><li style="font-weight: 400;">Within an institution, it might be possible to schedule regular check-ins with the Facilitator and interested participants.</li> </ul> <div class="footnotes"><div id='762-1'>

Facilitators attend sessions and provide feedback on the facilitation skills of participants who are taking the Practicing Facilitator track.</p> <p><strong>Time Requirements for Facilitators</strong>: Time to prepare the course before the start date will vary depending on the facilitators’ skill with the technologies used. During the course, facilitators can expect to spend approximately 15 hours per week; more time may be required to attend Practicing Facilitator sessions in the final week. First-time hosters may need even more time. Facilitators should expect to be available to the course on a daily basis.</p> <p><strong>Expectations – Participants</strong>: Participants are expected to participate fully in course activities, which are a mix of asynchronous and synchronous online activities. There are two role choices (tracks) for participants in this course — Reviewing Participant and Practicing Facilitator — allowing for flexibility in learning outcomes. Participation expectations differ depending on which track participants choose to complete.</p> <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Facilitators attend or review all Practicing Facilitator sessions and provide informal feedback – using a structured template – to the Practicing Facilitator that is open to all course participants. All participants complete a self-assessment rubric at the end of the course specific to the track they chose to complete. Facilitators review these self-assessment rubrics before determining participants’ completion of the course.</p> <p><strong>Time Requirements for Participants</strong>: Participants should expect to spend approximately 6-8 hours for course activities each week. Participants who choose the Practicing Facilitator track or who have little previous experience can expect to invest more time.</p> <p><strong>Primary Resource for Facilitators</strong>: All <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=23" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=23">materials for the FLO Synchronous course</a> are included in an Open Learning Resource (OER) from BCcampus, available for viewing or download. This guide is based on the 2019 version of the course.</p> <h1>What is FLO Synchronous?</h1> <p>Facilitating Learning Online (FLO) Synchronous is a three-week online course that helps people develop synchronous online facilitation skills. Participants learn best practice strategies to plan for, facilitate, and follow up after synchronous online learning events. FLO Synchronous provides participants with opportunities to see and learn from examples of synchronous online facilitation and, if desired, to practice synchronous online facilitation skills in a safe environment. This course is designed for faculty and staff who would like to increase their teaching and facilitation skills within a web conferencing environment.</p> <p>Participants have the option to engage with the course via one of two tracks: Reviewing Participant or Practicing Facilitator. This flexibility allows people to choose what kind of learning is best for them at the time they take the course. The Reviewing Participant track is focused on reviewing and discussing best practices in synchronous online facilitation, and providing feedback. The Practicing Facilitator track is focused on planning for, and facilitating, a short synchronous online event and receiving feedback.</p> <p>In a nutshell, the first week of the course is spent exploring how to prepare to facilitate synchronously online. The second week of the course is focused on facilitation skills in online synchronous environments. The last week of the course is focused on following up after facilitating online. It’s important to note that, during the last week of the course, participants who have chosen the Practicing Facilitator track will facilitate a short online session and Reviewing Participants will need to attend Practicing Facilitators’ sessions and provide feedback.</p> <p>FLO Synchronous works well with 10 or more participants and can accommodate participant numbers into the 20s, most likely with two facilitators.</p> <h1>Learning outcomes</h1> <p>There are two different sets of intended learning outcomes for the two tracks:</p> <h2>Reviewing participants track</h2> <p>By the end of the course you will be able to:</p> <ul><li>Identify effective planning and facilitation strategies for synchronous online sessions.</li> <li>Provide effective feedback to facilitators of synchronous online sessions.</li> <li>Explain the importance of evaluation for synchronous online sessions.</li> </ul> <h2>Practicing facilitators track</h2> <p>By the end of the course you will be able to:</p> <ul><li>Apply effective design strategies to plan for synchronous online sessions.</li> <li>Lead synchronous online sessions using appropriate facilitation skills.</li> <li>Use a web-based platform at a basic level to facilitate synchronous online sessions.</li> <li>Use reflection and feedback gathering to evaluate synchronous online sessions.</li> </ul> <h1>Participants</h1> <p>Participants who take FLO Synchronous are typically full- or part-time instructors at post-secondary institutions who are new to teaching online or have already been teaching online for some time and would like to develop teaching skills in the synchronous online mode. Participants may also include those who support teaching faculty, such as instructional/learning designers, educational consultants and learning technologists.</p> <p>Other potential participants may include graduate students, consultants from the private sector, and trainers employed by for-profit or non-profit organizations.</p> <h1>Technology</h1> <p>General recommendations for technology can be found in in Chapter 3: Tools to Support FLO.</p> <p>Some additional considerations for this course:</p> <ul><li>Access to a shared collaborative space, such as Google Docs, to be used as a booking calendar.</li> </ul> <h1>The course content and layout</h1> <p>The FLO Synchronous OER from BCcampus is a complete three-week course with a collection of content, activities and resources about facilitating in synchronous online environments.</p> <p>The course structure itself is divided into four sections:</p> <ul><li>Hub</li> <li>Week 1: Preparing for Synchronous Sessions</li> <li>Week 2: Facilitating Synchronous Sessions</li> <li>Week 3: Following Up After Synchronous Sessions</li> </ul> <h2>The Hub</h2> <p>The Hub is a general section that contains:</p> <ul><li>Course Overview. This includes course syllabus information such as a course description, descriptions of the participant tracks and related activities and outcomes, details about the Practicing Facilitator sessions, participation expectations and information about providing effective feedback throughout the course, and information about privacy and confidentiality and the course license.</li> <li>Course Schedule. This is a week-by-week schedule which is updated with new dates and times for each iteration of the course.</li> <li>Open Forum. Any participant can post to this forum. This design choice was made to bring facilitator announcements and cafe-type conversations into one place.</li> <li>A link to a booking calendar to allow Practicing Facilitators to book the use of the web conferencing platform.</li> <li>Links to two web conferencing rooms that can be used by any participant.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-237" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour.png" alt="Magnifying glass icon" width="100" height="99" title="" /></p> <h2 class="textbox__title">Privacy and confidentiality</h2> <p>Here is an example of the privacy and confidentiality statement that we have included in the FLO Synchronous Course Overview.

You will continue to have access to the course content and participants’ contributions after the end date, and for as long as this website is supported.</p> </div> </div> <p>The Hub also contains some resources hidden from participants. These resources are provided for facilitators and may also be helpful when many facilitators from the same institution take turns facilitating the course and want to share resources with each other. Examples of hidden resources include:</p> <ul><li>A Facilitator Resources Folder to hold lesson plans and slide decks for the three synchronous sessions that facilitators host for participants.</li> <li>Instructor-only links for the synchronous online platform that you will be using for the course.</li> <li>Any notes that past facilitators of the course want to keep inside the course for the next facilitators – or future facilitators – to see, such as recommendations for minor or major redevelopments of the course for future iterations.</li> </ul> <h2>Weekly sections</h2> <p>Each of the Week 1 through 3 sections features a poll, pages that describe that week’s activities, details about the synchronous online session being hosted by course facilitators that week, weekly course content, and a discussion forum. Week 3 also includes an upload area so participants can submit their self-assessment rubric, and a course feedback survey.</p> <h1>Course assessment</h1> <p>As noted above, all participants complete a self-assessment rubric at the end of the course specific to the track they chose to complete.</p> <p>The rubric details:</p> <ul><li>The requirements ALL participants need to complete, and</li> <li>The requirements they need to complete if they are Reviewing Participants, or</li> <li>The requirements they need to complete if they are Practicing Facilitators.</li> </ul> <p>The rubric is a three-point rubric with the categories of “did not meet requirements,” “met requirements,” and “exceeded” requirements. Rubric criteria include the following for all participants:</p> <ul><li>Participation in the synchronous sessions facilitated by the course facilitators.</li> <li>Participation in weekly discussion forums.</li> <li>Participation in weekly activities other than discussions.</li> </ul> <p>As well as (for Reviewing Participants):</p> <ul><li>Participation in synchronous sessions of Practicing Facilitators.</li> <li>Giving feedback to Practicing Facilitators.</li> </ul> <p>Or (for Practicing Facilitators):</p> <ul><li>Participating in synchronous sessions of Practicing Facilitators (note that the requirement is different than for Reviewing Participants).</li> <li>Giving feedback to Practicing Facilitators.</li> <li>Leading a synchronous online session</li> <li>Reflecting on their facilitation of their session.</li> </ul> <p>Participants are tasked with completing the self-assessment rubric (<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-synchronous-self-assessment-rubric" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-synchronous-self-assessment-rubric/">FLO Synchronous Self-Assessment Rubric</a>) by the end of the course and submitting it to course facilitators.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="768-1"></span></span></p> <h1>Facilitator task list: what you need to do before, during, and after the course</h1> <p>The successful hosting of FLO Synchronous requires an organized approach to planning and facilitation. A detailed facilitator task list has been developed for co-facilitators to support a successful delivery of the course.</p> <p>See the&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-synchronous-task-list" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-synchronous-task-list/">FLO Synchronous Task List</a>&nbsp;to review the detailed facilitator tasks alongside the following explanations. Note that not all items on the facilitator task list are further explained here, only those requiring some extra discussion and detail.</p> <h2>Before the course begins</h2> <h3>Set up the two web conferencing rooms</h3> <p>We advise setting up two web conferencing rooms on your platform of choice because Practicing Facilitator practice sessions and real sessions may overlap, especially with a large class. Decide what type of links you want to give participants for the rooms. For example, for the first synchronous session that course facilitators will facilitate, you might want to give participants an access link that allows them to enter the room from a participant viewpoint only, and not give them access to moderator tools. Later, for the second synchronous session in Week 2, you might want to give them moderator links so you can scaffold their learning to now see things from a moderator’s perspective.</p> <h3>Create a booking calendar</h3> <p>The booking calendar is what everyone in the course will use to book space in one of the two web conferencing rooms to hold practice or real sessions at any time throughout the course. This should be a tool that everyone has access to update.</p> <h3>Schedule online sessions</h3> <p>Schedule the three synchronous online sessions that you will lead (as a facilitator) into your calendar. Because there are three pre-planned synchronous online sessions in FLO Synchronous, it is important to pick times for these and book them well ahead of the course in your calendar. Advertise the dates in advance of participant course registraiton because it is part of the course expectatations to attend at least two of the three sessions.</p> <h3>Create/update the lesson plan and slide deck</h3> <p>Create/update the lesson plan and slide deck for the first synchronous session. It is important in FLO Synchronous to model the kinds of synchronous online facilitation skills that we hope participants will be able to learn and practice in the course. (This goes for all synchronous sessions that the facilitators facilitate, not just this first one.) This includes:</p> <ul><li>Creating and using lesson plans (not just slide decks) to model good design skills.</li> <li>Creating sessions that model the kinds of sessions we’d like to see participants design and facilitate in the course, i.e. sessions that are interactive, participatory, etc.</li> <li>Creating and including evaluations or feedback-eliciting mechanisms after each of the synchronous sessions to, again, model what we teach in the course. For example, after the first session we send out a short feedback survey to gather participants’ feedback.</li> </ul> <p>If you are co-facilitating, it is important to prepare for this session with your co-facilitator. A sample slide deck for this first session is in the OER version of FLO Synchronous, in the Facilitator Resources folder.</p> <h3>Choose and set up the tool for the Video Introductions activity</h3> <p>For course introductions during Week 1, we ask participants to submit introductions by video. This activity serves a two-fold purpose: It helps facilitators and participants get to know each other, and it gives participants a chance to practice and get comfortable with recording and being seen on video.</p> <p>Choose a tool that will allow participants to contribute short video clips (approx. 90 seconds) introducing themselves, and responding to one or two prompts that you provide.</p> <p>It is important for facilitators to model good examples of their own video introductions. “Good”examples include having an authentic and real presence, looking at the camera, not reading verbatim from a script, etc.</p> <p>Accessibility guidelines suggest providing alternative ways for learners to hear or read this content. Although informal, the content of brief introductions help learners develop a sense of community that enhances learning and promote retention. While transcripts might not be feasible, some re-sharing of introductions could be posted in alternative formats.</p> <p>The Video Introductions activity also helps us achieve one more purpose within the course. In other FLO courses, such as FLO Fundamentals, we have seen that engaging in an introductions activity in the first week can sometimes take a lot of time when people are excited to begin the course and contribute a large amount of posts. This can sometimes be overwhelming for people, particularly those new to online learning. While FLO Fundamentals is a five-week course, FLO Synchronous is a shorter, three-week course. Asking participants to contribute timed video-based introductions, no longer than 90 seconds each, helps participants limit the amount of time they need to spend on an introductions activity – either contributing an introduction or responding to the introductions of others. While we still want to include introductions as part of community-building in FLO Synchronous courses, shorter video-based introductions allow us to make space for other content and activities that we also need to engage in during that first week of the course.</p> <h3>Decide on Tech Times sessions</h3> <p>Tech Times are informal times that we hold twice in the course – one in Week 1 and one in Week 2 – to allow participants a chance to informally explore and get to know the web conferencing platform that we are using. Tech Times are optional to attend and there is no set agenda. Facilitators do not need a lesson plan to host Tech Times; you simply need to show up at the appointed time and support participants to learn about aspects of the synchronous platform you are using.</p> <p>Not every participant needs to attend a Tech Time but we’ve found that they can be very valuable for participants who are quite new to web conferencing technology or technology in general. Facilitators should know the platform well enough to host these technology-oriented sessions themselves, but could also invite learning technologist or IT-based colleagues at your institution to support participants as well. Tech Times can also be informal opportunities to build community and establish relationships with participants in the course. On a more practical note, they can also help course facilitators talk informally with participants about which track they might want to be on for the course.</p> <h3>Block time in personal calendars during Week 3<strong><br /> </strong></h3> <p>Week 3 of FLO Synchronous can be quite busy, particularly if you are facilitating the course alone. Book time in your calendar before the course begins to attend as many Practicing Facilitator sessions as you can at the end of Week 2/start of Week 3. While the course specifically indicates to participants that course facilitators may not be able to attend all sessions, it is a good idea – and a richer experience for all – if you attend as many as you can. Having a co-facilitator throughout the duration of the course helps for this with a big class! In our experience, and understandably, many more Practicing Facilitators tend to choose times for their sessions early in Week 3 rather than later in Week 2.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>It may also be helpful for you to use a time tracking system to track the time you spend on the course, both while preparing in advance of the course and during the course itself. Time tracking helps you spend enough – but not too much – time on the course, finding a balance that is workable with the rest of your life and work commitments. Tracking your time on course facilitation tasks the first time you facilitate FLO can also help make you more aware of how much time you need to save in your schedule for the next time you teach FLO.</p> </div> <h2>During the course</h2> <h3>Week 1: Preparing for synchronous sessions</h3> <h4>Write a welcome post</h4> <p>We recommend that facilitators use the Open Forum throughout the course to let participants know what is happening and to build a sense of community. Posting a welcome post to participants on the first day of the course sets the tone and practice for many similar posts to come.</p> <h4>Video Introductions activity</h4> <p>Throughout the first week of the course, facilitators should regularly monitor incoming video introductions and make sure at least one facilitator responds to every participant video. Responding to participant videos offers a welcoming course presence and allows participants to begin to get to know you as course facilitators.</p> <h4>First synchronous online session</h4> <p>At the beginning of the course, facilitators should hold their first synchronous online session. We’ve found that if the course starts on a Monday, Tuesday is a good time. The first slide of the sample deck (found in the Facilitator Resources folder in the OER version of FLO Synchronous) lists the technical skills (such as knowing how to turn on microphones, type in the chat box and raise hands) that we want participants to learn during that session. While the web conferencing platform that you choose may have slightly different tools, the concept is the same: think about the basic technical skills that you’d like participants to build during that first session, and plan your lesson and slide deck accordingly.</p> <p>This first synchronous online session also starts building community with, and among, course participants. Participants get to know each other a little, talk briefly about course overview details, find out what the course is all about, and start thinking about the track they’d like to be on for the course. (Remember, they can choose from Reviewing Participant or Practicing Facilitator; participants need to choose their track by the end of Week 1.)</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>In FLO Synchronous, participants must attend at least two of the three synchronous sessions led by course facilitators. You will likely want to post links to the recordings of the sessions after each one. It may also be a good idea to recap a few of the most important things that happened or were discussed in the session so participants who couldn’t make it don’t miss key course messages. An example of one of these posts is below.</p> </div> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Example: Link to synchro session recording</h2> <p>By <strong>Beth Cougler Blom</strong></p> <p>Thanks to all of you who came out to this afternoon’s synchro session to kick off our course. If you weren’t able to make it, you can view the recording via this link. (A link to the recordings page for Room 1 is also in the Quick Links block in the course).</p> <p>Our main points in the session were some introduction, overviewing the course and getting clear on the Reviewing Participant versus Practicing Facilitator tracks and the group spent some time in triads in breakout rooms getting to know each other and discussing their tracks and possible topics for facilitated sessions.</p> <p>I’m attaching a copy of the slide deck for your reference.</p> </div> </div> <h4>Additional Open Forum posts</h4> <p>As mentioned above, we recommend that course facilitators write posts in the Open Forum throughout the course to keep participants on track and to maintain instructor presence in the course. Opening and closing posts for every week are a good idea, and you might also need to add in extra posts for other reasons mid-week, such as:</p> <ul><li>Posting the link to the recordings of synchronous sessions and highlighting key information for people who weren’t able to make them.</li> <li>Encouraging/celebrating participation in course activities.</li> <li>Noting upcoming events, such as the Tech Times or Practicing Facilitator sessions.</li> <li>Responding to poll results or other weekly activities.</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--key-takeaways"><div class="textbox__content"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-251" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-Callout-Colour.png" alt="Light bulb icon" width="100" height="117" title="" /></p> <p>When writing Open Forum posts you may wish to consider using different strategies to make your posts interesting and engaging. Options here include, but aren’t limited, to:</p> <ul><li>Including relevant <a href="https://creativecommons.org/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/">Creative Commons</a> or open-licensed images that may enhance the content of your post or provide a fun and light-hearted accompaniment.</li> <li>Creating short informal videos instead of text-based posts.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="768-2"></span></span></li> <li>Incorporating other tech tools depending on what you’re trying to achieve (e.g. posting an annotated screen capture to show participants where something can be found in the course).</li> <li>Sharing links to related or current events content that is relevant to course topics.</li> </ul> </div> </div> <h4>Be in touch with participants who haven’t logged in/aren’t participating</h4> <p>As facilitators of online learning, one of our roles is to maintain an awareness of how engaged our participants are in the course and to use strategies to support them if their attention appears to be flagging. We do this right from the beginning of the course. A good idea is to set expectations with participants right from Week 1 about their course contributions. This is a particularly important time to see if participants have logged in and, if they haven’t, reach out to them individually to see if they need help.</p> <p>Checking in with participants who haven’t yet logged in – or who logged in initially but have taken a break of several days – is a good idea to make sure they are getting over any technological hurdles with the course platform. In some cases we’ve found out, after contacting an absent participant early in Week 1, that they never received the course registration email with login details! One strategy to use with participants who have logged in but not really engaged with any activity yet is to email them individually and invite them in (or back into) the course, so they know you have noted their absence. Often these kinds of emails result in a good exchange between participant and facilitator, and sometimes illuminate events going on in the participant’s life that have just temporarily gotten in the way.</p> <p>FLO courses requires a lot of commitment and participation in order to be effective. If you find out a participant is deeply struggling, perhaps from an overwhelming schedule, your role is to help them decide if now is the right time to take the course. We strongly advise against allowing participants to audit FLO courses for many reasons, the least of which is that they will not be able to achieve course learning outcomes if they do.</p> <p>In other situations, a direct connection between facilitator and participant can uncover the fact that the participant is struggling with the course platform or other technology. In this case, it is a facilitator’s role to attempt to support the participant as much as you can. Sending illustrative screen captures, meeting one-on-one in a web conferencing tool (if possible) where you can share your screen with the participant to show them things, or enlisting the help of learning technologists or IT professionals at your institution, are all options to draw from to provide early technological support to course participants.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>One idea to help you track interactions with your participants to ensure you engage with them fairly equally throughout the course is to use a tracking matrix. This can be a simple spreadsheet with all your participants’ names in the first column on the left and many blank columns next to them on the right. Every time you respond to a participant, make a mark in a column next to their name. Over time, you can use this matrix to try to spread out your forum post responses to participants. This may help each participant feel heard by you as their facilitator throughout the course.

As mentioned above, the two tracks are Reviewing Participant and Practicing Facilitator.</p> <p>Having two tracks of engagement for a course is something that needs a bit of managing. Our aim is to ensure that enough people choose the Practicing Facilitator track so everyone has enough sessions to attend in Week 3, and to see several (or many) examples of synchronous online facilitation. Say, for example, that you have a class size of 20. You wouldn’t want only two of the 20 participants to choose the Practicing Facilitator track! Ideally 6-8 participants or more would choose to go that route in that size of class.</p> <p>This means that part of our role as course facilitators is to encourage participants to take a risk and choose the potentially harder track of Practicing Facilitator, when their natural inclination might be to play it safe on the Reviewing Participants track. Happily, the time that you spend in the first synchronous session and the Tech Time in Week 1 can help you uncover potentially keen participants whom you think may be willing to stretch themselves on the Practicing Facilitator track. You may be able to encourage participants on a one-on-one basis through emails or private course messages, but certainly an Open Forum post to encourage risk-taking is a good idea as well. See the image below for an example post that attempts to do just that.</p> <p>Something else to keep in mind while helping participants choose their track is that FLO Synchronous offers a tremendous opportunity – because of the existence of the two tracks – for participants to take the course more than once. Some participants may wish to stay in the relatively safe zone of the Reviewing Participants track while taking the course for the first time, but challenge themselves a little more on the Practicing Facilitator track in the future.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Example: First Synchronous Session tomorrow at 12pm</h2> <p>By <strong>Beth Cougler Blom</strong> – Wednesday, 25 October 2017, 4:36 PM</p> <div class="wp-caption alignleft" id="attachment_237" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-237" style="width: 100px"><img class="wp-image-237" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-LongExample-Colour.png" alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" width="100" height="99" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-237">Magnifying glass.</div></div> <p>Consider this your encouragement!

There are several purposes for the second synchronous session:</p> <ol><li>Provide time for participants to talk about their synchronous online facilitation goals using the Facilitation Session Guide (found in the Course Overview) as a point of discussion.</li> <li>Create an opportunity for participants to experience a very active and participatory synchronous online learning environment, and see course facilitators modelling how to facilitate such an environment.</li> <li>Give participants a chance to see and learn about the web conferencing platform from a moderator perspective.</li> </ol> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>In one version of FLO Synchronous we used a 1-2-4-All activity from <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com" data-url="http://www.liberatingstructures.com">Liberating Structures</a> to involve participants in a discussion activity. This activity asks participants to think individually – in response to a question prompt we gave them – in silence for 1 minute, work in pairs (in breakout rooms) for two minutes, and work in foursomes (in new breakout rooms) for four minutes, then return to the larger group for a debrief.</p> </div> <div>In the second session we also have the opportunity to showcase and model a different kind of check-in activity, to continue building our participants’ toolbox full of synchronous online activities that they can use in their own sessions in the future.</div> <p>It is important to mention that the second session should also include a feedback-eliciting activity, to (again) model that we are asking for feedback from our participants – the topic of Week 3. Since we sent a feedback form after the first session, we have included the feedback-eliciting activity within the lesson plan of the second session.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>One way you can gather feedback from participants at the end of the second synchronous online session is a modified User Experience Fishbowl from <a href="http://www.liberatingstructures.com" data-url="http://www.liberatingstructures.com">Liberating Structures</a>. You can find instructions for this particular activity in the lesson plan and slide deck for Session 2 in the Facilitator Resources Folder in the OER version of FLO Synchronous.</p> </div> <p>There is a sample lesson plan and slide deck in the Facilitator Resources folder in the OER version of FLO Synchronous.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>If you are co-facilitating this course and would like to practice facilitating the second synchronous session together, consider opening up that practice session for viewing to course participants! Put it into the Booking Calendar and mention it in one of your Open Forum posts that anyone is welcome to attend. Make it clear that your participants will be observers only if they choose to drop in. This could give your participants a rare behind-the-scenes glimpse into how experienced facilitators plan lessons and prepare to co-facilitate together online, and provide a rich learning opportunity at the same time.</p> </div> <h4>Connect with Practicing Facilitators</h4> <p>Early in Week 2 it is important to connect with Practicing Facilitators – likely via an Open Forum post – to make sure they are aware of the requirements for their role and facilitated session. It may be worthwhile to point out the Participant Facilitation Sessions page of the Course Overview and the Facilitation Session Guide document located near the bottom of that page.</p> <p>The Facilitation Session Guide is a form that you and other participants can use to capture and give Practicing Facilitators feedback after participating in their session. The Guide includes many skills, divided into sections, that have to do with facilitating synchronously online. It features blank boxes to jot down areas of particular skill and areas for improvement that you’d like to note for the practicing facilitator.</p> <h4>Connect with Reviewing Participants</h4> <p>In the same vein, it’s important early in Week 2 to connect with Reviewing Participants to ensure they know they need to be an active participant in the course throughout; they have to give feedback to Practicing Facilitators as they prepare for their facilitation, and must also participate in at least two synchronous sessions of Practicing Facilitators and give feedback to them. An Open Forum post to Reviewing Participants is a great idea to reinforce these expectations with them in Week 2. They are definitely not just auditing the course!</p> <h4>Mention the Self-Assessment Rubric</h4> <p>Remember the self-assessment rubric we discussed above? Week 2 is a good time for course facilitators to remind participants they will need to complete it at the end of the course. This is an opportunity for participants to evaluate – in an informal and formative way – their course engagement to-date and take action to potentially increase their course engagement and make more time for course activities. Reminding participants about course expectations half-way through the course is another great opportunity to set them up for success to achieve all the learning outcomes for their track by the end of FLO Synchronous.</p> <h4>Sample Synchros Activity</h4> <p>The Sample Synchros activity in Week 2 provides opportunities for course participants to watch short video examples of other people facilitating synchronously online. You may wish to replace the sample videos included in the OER version of the course with your own sample synchros, particularly as platform technology changes.</p> <p>It is important to reinforce to participants that the sample synchros are not meant to provide expert examples of synchronous online facilitation. In fact, most of the sample synchros included in the OER course are recordings of faculty members learning how to facilitate synchronously online, just like your participants will be. However, providing samples of any kind allows us to facilitate a discussion about what strategies we saw the facilitators using that were effective and not. The samples provide a jumping-off point for a rich discussion about effective online facilitation strategies. (Discussion prompts are already included in the activity.)</p> <h3>Week 3: Following up after synchronous sessions</h3> <h4 style="text-align: left">Practicing Facilitator sessions</h4> <p>The first few days of Week 3 are usually a rush of attending Practicing Facilitator sessions. Ensure that all participants know the expectations around attending these sessions. That is, we don’t just want people to show up to the session; we want them to engage in it.</p> <p>Remember, you have not promised to attend all Practicing Facilitator sessions; however, you should try your best to make as many as you can (or split them up when co-facilitating so at least one of you could be at all sessions). If you need to miss a session, ensure that you watch the recording in a timely manner, fill out the Facilitation Session Guide and give robust feedback to the Practicing Facilitator by the end of Week 3.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>If you have access to a scanner, you can scan in your completed Facilitation Session Guide full of handwritten notes and attach it for the particular Practicing Facilitator when writing your feedback post for them during Week 3. Alternatively, you could create an electronic version to add your comments.</p> </div> <h4>Final synchronous session</h4> <p>The final synchronous session that you will facilitate in FLO Synchronous is an opportunity to gather one last time with your participants, look back on everyone’s experience in the course and reflect on learning. Not surprisingly, with this session – as with all sessions – your purpose is to showcase activities that participants can take away and use on their own, and to model effective online facilitation.</p> <p>The last session also allows you to offer one last facilitation opportunity to one or more of your participants. Late in Week 2 or early in Week 3 you could mention in an Open Forum post that you’d like to invite one or more participants to co-facilitate the final synchronous online session with you. In our experience, you won’t always find a participant to step up to accept this invitation but when they do, it can be a wonderful learning opportunity for both you and the participant.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>Want to give your participants another chance at behind-the-scenes learning? Do your lesson planning for your final synchronous session in the open by posting the lesson plan in a Google Doc or other shared site. Then, give your participants access to it as you’re building it. Invite them to make comments in the document – likely using a built-in comment feature so they are easy to see – so they can engage with you and ask you questions during your preparation process. This is yet another opportunity for participants to see the preparation and lesson planning process – and all the inherent decision-making within – that you carried out along the way, in addition to your finished product of facilitation.</p> </div> <h4>Write closing Open Forum post</h4> <p>Your closing Open Forum post is one of your last opportunities to make a connection with course participants and (hopefully!) leave them with a positive impression of the course. This post will likely contain last housekeeping bits of information, such as the need for participants to complete and submit their self-assessment rubric as well as the course feedback form. You should also include warm words of thanks to everyone involved for engaging in the course and wish them well on their online facilitation journeys in the future. As always, you will bring your own personal flair and authenticity to the crafting of this post.</p> <h1>After the course</h1> <h2>Respond to self-assessment rubrics</h2> <p>While you may have had the opportunity to respond to participant self-assessment rubrics in the last days of the course – if they submitted them early – you may also need to spend some time after the course ends to finish up this last task. Remember that the self-assessment rubric is directly tied to the course outcomes. If you see an issue or a mismatch with how the participant perceives their course engagement and how you perceive it, you may wish to reach out directly by phone or email to that person to invite a discussion about their course completion.</p> <h2>Read course feedback forms and reflect on own facilitation</h2> <p>Reflection on your facilitation practice is an important part of facilitating online. Ensure you make time to read course feedback forms and debrief with any co-facilitators that you worked with throughout the course. Make notes of things that you’d like to enhance or change for next time – especially while it’s fresh in your memory! Recognize both the strengths you brought to the course as an online facilitator and what you’d like to continue to learn about and practice as you go forward on your own journey in online facilitation.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='768-1'>The self-assessment rubric references the “Providing Effective Feedback” section in the Course Overview to further illustrate the expectations to participants around what effective feedback should look like.</div><div id='768-2'>Keep accessibility top-of-mind: you may need to include a transcript of your video.</div></div></div></div>

Each MicroCourse focuses on a different topic; new MicroCourses are added as topics are put forward by educators or suggested by emergent trends. This enables educators to selectively explore relevant issues, tools and strategies. The spirit of FLO MicroCourses is to offer an open and flexible experience within a scheduled framework.</p> <p><strong>Mode</strong>: A facilitated asynchronous online course</p> <p><strong>Length</strong>: Five days</p> <p><strong>Expectations – facilitators</strong>: Facilitators provide support throughout the course and foster a comfortable and inviting space to encourage sharing of unfinished work for peer review. The facilitator does not need to be an expert in the subject area.</p> <p><strong>Time requirements for facilitators</strong>: The time commitment varies depending on the number of facilitators, their prior experience, and the number of participants. Typically, facilitators are also involved in the design of the course materials unless they are re-using a previously implemented MicroCourse. Each facilitator can expect to spend at least 5 hours during the week, more if they are providing direct feedback on the participants’ work.</p> <p><strong>Expectations – participant</strong>s: Participants are expected to follow the steps for the course activities and can choose how detailed they wish to make their drafts and prototypes. However, there is an expectation that participants reciprocate with feedback; if they are offering something for peer review, they should also provide feedback to others.</p> <p><strong>Assessment</strong>: Through peer review, participants give and receive feedback, reflect on what is useful and relevant, and refine their prototypes. A peer feedback rubric is included to guide the process of giving feedback.</p> <p><strong>Time requirements for participants</strong>: Participants should expect to spend 5 hours for course activities. Those with no prior online teaching and learning experiences can expect to invest more time.</p> <p><strong>Primary resource for facilitators</strong>: All MicroCourses contain familiar elements: templates for designers and facilitators to use and modify for their specific topic. After a MicroCourse is implemented, it is made available as an <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=26" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=26">Open Educational Resource (OER)</a>. Facilitators can then download a course, implement it, or completely re-work it for a new topic.</p> <h1>What are FLO MicroCourses?</h1> <p>Facilitating Learning Online (FLO) MicroCourses are five-day courses that focus on a single topic. Participants engage in a five-step process to create a draft or prototype, and then give and receive feedback. Participants&nbsp; then leave with something practical and useful for their own teaching practice, whether it’s of their own creation or borrowed from their peers.</p> <p>We created the concept of short FLO MicroCourses to appeal to more participants than could attend a longer course. Many participants reported being astounded at how much they learned from their first full intensive FLO course (such as FLO Fundamentals or FLO Design), and how valuable participatory and collaborative learning was. However, the length of the foundational FLO courses could be a barrier for some people. For example, it could be challenging for faculty to devote five weeks to complete FLO Fundamentals during a semester with a full teaching load. Therefore, FLO MicroCourses offer a dip into the FLO experience without the full-time commitment.</p> <p>Here are some suggested topics for MicroCourses:</p> <ul><li>Make your course intro video</li> <li>Creating and using rubrics</li> <li>Experience and design a community-building activity</li> <li>Write your teaching philosophy statement</li> <li>Design course evaluation surveys</li> <li>Metacognition: Rethinking the role of thinking in learning</li> <li>Writing a compelling discussion prompt</li> <li>Create an explainer video</li> <li>Acknowledging traditional Indigenous lands</li> <li>Design with Liberating Structures</li> <li>Teach with stories</li> </ul> <p>Benefits of MicroCourses:</p> <ul><li>They’re short, manageable chunks of productive learning.</li> <li>They provide a taste before committing to a full FLO course and allow participants to experience facilitated, active, peer-supported, outcome-based learning.</li> <li>They provide an opportunity to practice facilitation.</li> </ul> <p>As outlined in Chapter 3, the mentorship model for preparing future FLO facilitators requires that we provide opportunities to practice. These short courses are a smaller time commitment for FLO facilitators than the 3-, 4- or 5-week courses, yet they provide a rich experience in both activity planning and facilitation. Offering the courses frequently, and working in teams, opens up more possibilities.</p> <h1>Learning outcomes</h1> <p>A MicroCourse provides a framework for introducing any number of topics and projects. As such, the learning outcomes change from one course to the next.</p> <h1>Participants</h1> <p>Participants who take FLO MicroCourses are typically full- or part-time instructors at post-secondary education institutions. Participants may also include those who support teaching faculty such as instructional/learning designers, educational consultants and learning technologists. Other potential participants include graduate students, consultants from the private sector and staff who work at for-profit or non-profit organizations.</p> <p>There are no prerequisites for MicroCourses so participants could potentially come from any domain.</p> <p>FLO MicroCourses work well with 10 or more active participants which allows for sufficient variety in the prototypes and more exposure to new ideas and examples. The course model can certainly accommodate more than 10, mainly because of the peer review element. To date, we have not placed a limit on enrolment and fully expect that not all participants will be active. Facilitators do not reach out to participants if they aren’t engaging in the course, such as they would to participants of other FLO courses.</p> <h1>Technology</h1> <p>General recommendations for technology can be found in in Chapter 3: Tools to Support FLO. Other tools can be considered on a per course basis depending on the topic of each MicroCourse.</p> <h1>The course content and layout</h1> <p>The <a href="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=26" data-url="https://scope.bccampus.ca/course/index.php?categoryid=26">FLO MicroCourse OERs</a> from BCcampus are complete 5-day courses with a collection of content, activities and resources. <span style="font-size: 14pt;">The BCcampus MicroCourses are open to the public.

These posts are more likely to be noticed because they are in their own separate forum.</p> <h2>Questions &amp; Answers / Open forum</h2> <p>This forum is where you ask for (and give) help/clarification/guidance. While there will be some overlap with the conversations that take place in the Sharing &amp; Feedback forum described below, having this Q&amp;A as a separate forum makes it easier to zone in on precisely what is relevant at that moment.</p> <h2>Sharing &amp; Feedback forum</h2> <p>This forum is used for sharing prototypes and providing feedback. It includes prompts for presenting the work as well as for providing peer feedback.</p> <h1>Course assessment</h1> <p>There are no set requirements for completing MicroCourses. However, all participants who share prototypes receive feedback from peers and/or the facilitators. Guidelines for providing quality feedback are outlined, so in that sense, it is a self-assessment tool for rating feedback efforts. (See&nbsp;<a class="internal" href="#chapter-flo-microcourse-peer-feedback-rubric" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/chapter/flo-microcourse-peer-feedback-rubric/">FLO MicroCourse Peer Feedback Rubric</a>.)</p> <h1>Facilitator task list: What you need to do before, during, and after the course</h1> <p>The successful hosting of a FLO MicroCourse requires an organized approach to planning and facilitation. The following suggestions will support the facilitation team to successfully implement the course.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--exercises"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Two heads are better than one</h2> <div class="wp-caption alignright" id="attachment_773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-773" style="width: 150px"><img class="wp-image-773 size-thumbnail" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image2-17-150x150.png" alt="Robin Leung" width="150" height="150" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image2-17-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image2-17-65x64.png 65w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-773">Figure 7.1</div></div> <p>This is what Robin Leung had to say in his “lessons learnt” report after his first MicroCourse co-facilitation experience:</p> <blockquote><p>I learnt that you need a co-facilitator that balances with your life well. I had a more technical background and my co-facilitator had more of the facilitation background. I am a night owl (catching most of the activities at night), and she’s the early riser (catching most of the activities in the day time). I think we complemented one another very well.</p> <p>— Robin Leung<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="778-1"></span></span></p></blockquote> </div> </div> <h2>Before the course begins</h2> <h3>Promote the course</h3> <p>Think about ways to advertise your course in a way that appeals to individuals from a variety of backgrounds and disciplines. The more diversity in your course the richer the discussions and feedback. In your communication, emphasize the informal and practical nature of the course, as well as the potential to leave with a full bag of ideas and examples.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>Consider using social media to help build interest, to share snippets from the course while it is in&nbsp;progress, and to post highlights from participants’ feedback. This is especially helpful as a way to sustain interest if you offer the MicroCourses as a series.</p> </div> <div></div> <h3>Review the MicroCourse Handbook</h3> <p>This handbook is intended to be very general so that it can be used in every MicroCourse. However, you may need to remove any information that is not relevant to your offering.</p> <h3>Adjust the course dates to match your offering</h3> <p>In the BCcampus version of the course, the dates are listed on the main page as well as in the polling activity (within the LMS) that we use for registration. Your learning management system may also require dates to be set for each course.</p> <h3>Invite self-enrolment</h3> <p>You may choose to organize the registration process in a way that suits your institution. However, we have found that self-enrolment works well for this course because we are not limiting the enrolment.</p> <h3>Edit the Activity Packet</h3> <p>The activity packet should include all the information a participant needs to complete the five steps. This includes essential details, but also links to other resources and forums mentioned in the steps.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>Keep the activity packet concise. It is not meant to be a dumping ground for content related to your topic. Encourage exploration of the subject matter and perhaps link to a few key readings.</p> </div> <h3>Create a co-facilitation plan</h3> <p>There is no shortage of ways to spend your time as a facilitator. With a plan for how you will divide up the tasks, you can maintain a manageable workload and avoid overstepping. For example, two concurrent responses containing similar information to a participant’s question is not value-added. You may decide to alternate days, allowing for breaks from the course or more time to simply sit back and enjoy browsing the contributions. Another possibility is to divide participants into groups and each facilitator declares responsibility for individuals in their group. This way you can ensure that all participants receive some form of acknowledgement of their work.</p> <h3>Open the course</h3> <p>Open the course a few days before the start date. This suggestion is optional, but we have found that participants are ready to roll up their sleeves on day one of the course if given this opportunity to preview what’s ahead.</p> <h3>Decide how participants will become acquainted</h3> <p>A 5-day course does not allow much time for community building! So, you may wish to create a shared Google Doc and ask everyone to respond to one or two “about me” questions. This way, everyone can stay on schedule and use their time wisely. In Moodle, we have used the Glossary tool for introductions because it avoids the subscription issues that can sometimes come with using forums. It also gives better display and sorting options and allows comments.</p> <h1>During the course</h1> <h3>Write a welcome post</h3> <p>You may have already posted a “doors are open” announcement to invite participants to see what is ahead in the week to come. Your post on the first day should include details about what participants should attend to immediately. This conveys the fast-paced nature of the course, and zones in on exactly what is relevant for that day.</p> <p>The tone of your post is important. Avoid pressuring participants to comply with course deadlines, or suggesting they are only welcome if they are committed to following the activity plan. This is an informal, adult learning environment; expect that individuals will have their own agenda.</p> <p>Establishing a protocol for facilitator posts can help them to be noticed and reinforce the timeframe. For example, the subject heading for this post is Day 1: Rise and Shine. The next day’s post was Day 2: Dig In, and so on.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><p><img class="alignright wp-image-774" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles-167x300.png" alt="" width="139" height="250" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles-167x300.png 167w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles-65x117.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles-225x403.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles-350x628.png 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/feetandpuddles.png 469w" title="" /></p> <h2>Post Example: Day 1: Rise and Shine</h2> <p>By <strong>Sylvia Currie</strong> – Monday, 17 September 2018, 7:08 AM</p> <p>With MicroCourses we just jump right in. Let’s do this!</p> <p>Almost everything you need is in the Activity Packet.</p> <p>Today is all about the research phase: steps 1 to 6. The recommended timeframe for completion is, gulp, today! Don’t worry, some of it is quite light, and mostly requires solo pondering and reflection.</p> <p>Thanks to everyone who posted a quick hello over the weekend! Drop a comment or two if you feel compelled.</p> <p>Questions? Ask anything, anytime in the Questions &amp; Answers form.</p> <p>Your facilitators,</p> <p>Sylvia Currie, Bettina Boyle, Jacquie Harrison</p> </div> </div> <h3>Acknowledge the arrival of participants</h3> <p>How you do this will depend on the way the course is set up. If you have included an introduction activity, facilitators should quickly respond to those who have taken this first step. If there is no planned way of “arriving” to the course, you can still send direct messages or personal email. Any effort to reach out early in the course will help establish facilitator presence.</p> <h3>Attend to the calls for help</h3> <p>Ideally, if the activity packet is clearly laid out, there won’t be too many of these. However, you should respond to any questions pertaining to the course process as quickly as possible. Make sure you coordinate with your co-facilitator who will respond.</p> <h3>Monitor the sharing of drafts and prototypes</h3> <p>It’s exciting when the prototypes begin to roll in! What is the facilitator’s role when peer review is the centre of the course design? This is an area that requires balance and judgment. The best advice is to:</p> <ol><li style="font-weight: 400;">Be concerned only if an uncomfortable amount of time goes by without any replies.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Only offer genuine feedback.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Resist the urge to be thorough, but be clear that you’re only commenting on one or two aspects of the artifact.</li> <li style="font-weight: 400;">Invite participants to jump in and elaborate, using your curious voice: “I can’t wait to read others’ first impressions and advice.”</li> </ol> <p>Also, consider the impact if facilitators only respond to one or two contributions. Will others feel neglected? Quite possibly! So, it’s important to establish expectations that you may acknowledge contributions but not provide comprehensive feedback. After all, other participants might have more subject matter expertise than you, and they will provide valuable feedback.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-741" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png" alt="Facilitator touch icon" width="100" height="99" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-150x150.png 150w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch-65x64.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/FLO-guide-facilitator-touch.png 216w" title="" /></p> <p>Jumping in too quickly to offer your advice or feedback, or to respond to questions, might discourage others from engaging.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> </div> <h3>Continue with daily facilitator posts</h3> <p>Plan to begin each day with a forum post (announcement) that shines a light on progress, and brings attention to where participants should be in the process.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--examples"><div class="textbox__content"><h2>Post Example: Day 2: Dig in!</h2> <p>By <strong>Jacquie Harrison</strong> – Tuesday, 18 September 2018, 9:43 AM</p> <p><img class="alignright wp-image-775 size-medium" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging-300x168.png" alt="" width="300" height="168" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging-300x168.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging-65x36.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging-225x126.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging-350x196.png 350w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/Digging.png 651w" title="" /></p> <p>Good morning!</p> <p>It’s so nice to see you all in the quick hello. We are a talented group!</p> <p>If you are following the suggested timeline for this MicroCourse, you spent some time thinking about what rubrics are, maybe looking at few examples and considering how and why you could use a rubric in a course that you teach.</p> <p>Now, it’s time to roll up your sleeves and develop a first draft. We’re moving in to Step 7 in the Activity Packet.</p> <p>Please post your draft rubric in the Sharing and Feedback by Wednesday evening.</p> <p>Happy developing!</p> </div> </div> <h3>Harvest the gems!</h3> <p>Throughout the course, it’s useful to create a routine that brings together the resources that the participants are sharing. Often this falls on the facilitators, but certainly encourage everyone to compile and organize artifacts.</p> <h2>After the course</h2> <h3>Write a closing post</h3> <p>Facilitators need to gauge the opportune moment to wrap up this five-day course. Since there can still be a lot of buzz on the Friday, Saturday could be better so it doesn’t look like you are checking out early, and there may still be participants busily working away on course activities. In any case, open up the opportunity for participants to share their revised prototypes even if it is past the moment of receiving further feedback. You might also suggest they can still offer encouragement and appreciation to their classmates. Also, remind participants that the course remains open, if that is how your establishment chooses to handle these courses. If you have this information, mention the upcoming MicroCourses; word of mouth is the best way to build interest in open learning opportunities!</p> <h3>Evaluation survey</h3> <p>Remind participants about the importance of providing course feedback. So much can be gleaned from these surveys! A sample basic evaluation survey can be found in <a class="internal" href="#back-matter-appendix3" data-url="/flofacilitatorguide/back-matter/appendix3/">Appendix 3: Generalized Course Evaluation Survey</a>.</p> <h3>Facilitator debrief</h3> <p>Don’t part company with your co-facilitators without scheduling a debrief. It’s important to share experiences and ideas about the facilitation process, otherwise you are destined to repeat what could have been improved! Keep notes and share them with other facilitators, if possible.</p> <div class="textbox"><p><img class="alignleft wp-image-743" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-300x258.png" alt="Quote icon" width="100" height="86" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-300x258.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-1024x881.png 1024w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-768x661.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-1536x1321.png 1536w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-2048x1762.png 2048w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-65x56.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-225x194.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/BCCampus-FLOGuide-ShortExample-Colour-350x301.png 350w" title="" /></p> <p>Here are some snippets from past debriefs:</p> <blockquote><p>“Maybe we could be more explicit? Give them a heads-up about what they can’t do on mobile devices?”</p> <p>“Not really useful to share tools that are only available within big institutions, or that require logins that don’t adhere to workplace guidelines”</p> <p>“Opening up the course early made a big difference. Let’s do that again next time!”</p></blockquote> </div> <h3>Summary report</h3> <p>Publishing a summary of what transpired can help participants feel a sense of accomplishment, and can also help build interest in upcoming MicroCourses. Consider including participation data, quotes from the evaluation survey or forum posts. For example, this graph clearly illustrates a high level of participant engagement in the “Creating and using rubrics” MicroCourse — probably higher than anyone realized.<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="778-2"></span></span><a id="7.6" data-url=""></a><a class="internal" data-url=""></a></p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_777" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-777" style="width: 1422px"><a href="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2018/10/image8-2.png" data-url="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2018/10/image8-2.png"><img class="wp-image-149 size-full" src="https://opentextbc.ca/flofacilitatorguide/wp-content/uploads/sites/169/2020/04/image8-2.png" alt="A graph showing high engagement in the Creating and Using Rubrics MicroCourse" width="1422" height="872" title="" /></a><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-777">Figure 7.2.

<div class="back-matter miscellaneous" id="back-matter-appendix2" title="Appendix 2: Glossary"><div class="back-matter-title-wrap"><h3 class="back-matter-number">2</h3><h1 class="back-matter-title">Appendix 2: Glossary</h1></div><div class="ugc back-matter-ugc"> <p>A list of abbreviations, acronyms, and terminology used in this document.</p> <h1>Asynchronous</h1> <p>Asynchronous communication involves a separation of time between listening (or reading) and responding. Examples of asynchronous communication include postal systems, discussion forums, email, and various bulletin board type tools. For synchronous communication, see the definition below.</p> <h1>BCcampus</h1> <p><a href="https://bccampus.ca/" data-url="https://bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a> provides teaching, learning, educational technology, and open education support to post-secondary institutions in the province of British Columbia, Canada. Through partnerships with B.C.’s post-secondary institutions, as well as government agencies and nonprofit groups and associations, BCcampus evaluates, facilitates, and collaborates on complex and innovative education projects.</p> <h1>CC BY</h1> <p>The Creative Commons Attribution-Only licence. Any work (text, images, video, etc.) licensed CC BY can be freely used by others and edited, revised, added to and distributed (even commercially), as long as the user gives credit to the original source or author. For more information, view the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/" data-url="https://creativecommons.org/licenses/">Creative Commons website</a>.</p> <h1>Community of Inquiry Model</h1> <p>The <a href="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/" data-url="https://coi.athabascau.ca/coi-model/">CoI Framework</a> is a theoretical framework (originally proposed by researchers at the University of Athabasca) used to analyze ways in which instructors (and students) create a deep and meaningful learning experience in online and blended learning environments through the development of three interdependent elements: &nbsp;social, cognitive and teaching presence. Teaching presence is the design, facilitation and direction of activities within a course.</p> <h1>Content Management System</h1> <p>A Content Management System (CMS) is a software program or set of related programs used to create and manage digital content. Some common CMSs (as of 2018) are WordPress, Wix, and Weebly. CMS products can be configured for learning management, but they generally require a higher level of user expertise than a product specifically designed for educational delivery (i.e. an LMS or VLE — see the definition below).</p> <h1>Facilitator</h1> <p>A facilitator works within a group to engage the group’s members in decision-making or brainstorming processes, mitigating conflicts and actively fostering course community. A facilitator working in an educational context helps learners understand course content through questioning, suggestions, examples and problem-solving, rather than through more directive teaching methods.</p> <h1>FAQ</h1> <p>Frequently Asked Questions. In any organized activity, many of the questions participants ask tend to be the same ones time and again. By providing a list of FAQs (with answers), you can help your participants get immediate answers to their most common questions.</p> <h1>Forum</h1> <p>In online learning, a forum is a site where participants and facilitators can post their comments, questions, etc. to discuss and debate ideas and aspects of the course content or learning activities. Discussion can take place asynchronously and topics are often organized by threads as participants reply to a specific posting.</p> <h1>Hosting</h1> <p>Hosting, in the context related to FLO courses, means the act of providing a content management system or learning management system for use to offer FLO courses to participants. Institutions may be able to host their own system, or they may need to purchase access to a system hosted by an external provider.</p> <h1>Learning outcome</h1> <p>Statements that describe important, intentional knowledge or skills that students can demonstrate at the end of a course or learning activity. A learning outcome statement usually begins with an action verb (to identify the action or level of learning) and a description of what the learner can reliably demonstrate within a specific context.</p> <h1>LMS / VLE</h1> <p>Learning Management System / Virtual Learning Environment. (LMS is the term more commonly used in North America; VLE is more common in Europe and other parts of the world). An LMS or VLE is a software product often used to organize online courses and classes. Some common LMS/VLE products are Moodle, Blackboard, Canvas, Desire2Learn. Other platforms used for LMS/VLE include WordPress, Google Classrooms, iTunesU.</p> <h1>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h1> <p>Open Educational Resources (OER) are teaching, learning or research materials that are in the public domain or released with intellectual property licenses that facilitate the free use, adaptation and distribution of resources. (UNESCO)</p> <h1>Post</h1> <p>A post is a message that a facilitator or learner writes in a forum or another conversational space that is included in a course. Individuals have the ability to post and reply to posts within conversational spaces in all FLO courses.</p> <h1>Reflection / reflective practice</h1> <p>Reflective practice, as described by educational researchers such as David Kolb and Stephen Brookfield, refers to the ability to pay critical attention to learning by examining actions both during and after they take place (i.e., reflectively and reflexively). The underlying theory is that people do not learn from experience alone; they benefit from considering actions and events from different perspectives, and by identifying important connections or underlying beliefs and theories.</p> <h1>Rubric</h1> <p>A rubric is a guide — often presented in table form — listing specific criteria for assessing or grading academic work (papers, projects, tests, etc.). Rubrics add value to the educational process by communicating expectations about performance, and by supporting constructive feedback on works in progress. By making performance standards explicit, rubrics can help students develop understanding, skill, and more dependable judgments about the quality of their own work. Rubrics are provided in FLO courses primarily to help participants assess their own progress towards facilitation goals.</p> <h1>Scaffolding</h1> <p>Much like the scaffolding that supports workers on a tall building, scaffolding in an instructional context refers to the supports an educator provides for students to help them learn. Educational scaffolding is based on the common-sense understanding that it’s almost impossible to learn a new concept or skill in its entirety; we learn best in incremental steps, with one concept or skill building upon another. The supports are gradually removed as the student becomes more independent and no longer needs additional aid.</p> <h1>Self-assessment</h1> <p>Self-assessment is the process of examining one’s own work and comparing it against identified criteria or goals. Based on the results of the assessment, learners can make a judgment as to whether (or how well) they have met these goals. In the FLO family of courses, self-assessment plays a critical role in the process of self-reflection and reflective practice (see the definition above), and is often supported with rubrics (see the definition above).</p> <h1>Synchronous</h1> <p>Synchronous communication (including communication for learning) is real-time communication where participants listen and respond to each other within the same timeframe. Examples of tools used for synchronous communication include telephones, Skype, Blackboard Collaborate, and FaceTime. For asynchronous communication, see the definition above.</p> <h1>Traditional acknowledgement</h1> <p>A traditional acknowledgement is a short message (text, video, or audio) acknowledging that the land on which the particular institution sits occupies the traditional territory of local Indigenous peoples.
