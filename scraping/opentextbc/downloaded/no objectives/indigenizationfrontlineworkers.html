The project was supported by a steering committee of Indigenous education leaders from BC universities, colleges, and institutes, the First Nations Education Steering Committee, the Indigenous Adult and Higher Learning Association, and Métis Nation BC.</p> <p>These guides are intended to support the systemic change occurring across post-secondary institutions through Indigenization, decolonization, and reconciliation. A guiding principle from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada process states why this change is happening.</p> <blockquote><p>Reconciliation requires constructive action on addressing the ongoing legacies of colonialism that have had destructive impacts on Aboriginal peoples’ education, cultures and languages, health, child welfare, the administration of justice, and economic opportunities and prosperity. (2015, p. 3)</p></blockquote> <p>We all have a role to play. As noted by Universities Canada, “[h]igher education offers great potential for reconciliation and a renewed relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people in Canada.” (2015) Similarly, Colleges and Institutions Canada notes that “Indigenous education will strengthen colleges’ and institutes’ contribution to improving the lives of learners and communities.” (2015) These guides provide a way for all faculty and staff to Indigenize their practice in post-secondary education.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_23" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-23" style="width: 792px"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline.png" alt="Front line, student services, and advisors can help paddle the canoe towards Indigenization" width="792" height="450" class="wp-image-23 size-full" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline.png 792w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline-300x170.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline-768x436.png 768w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline-65x37.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline-225x128.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/Paddlingtogetherfrontline-350x199.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-23">Fig 0.1: Pulling Together: A Canoe Journey Story.</div></div> <p>The Indigenization Project can be described as an evolving story of how diverse people can journey forward in a canoe (Fig 0.1). In Indigenous methodology, stories emphasize our relationships with our environment, our communities, and with each other. To stay on course, we are guided by the stars in the sky, with each star a project principle: deliver holistically, learn from one another, work together, share strengths, value collaboration, deepen the learning, engage respectfully, and learn to work in discomfort. As we look ahead, we do not forget our past.</p> <p>The canoe holds Indigenous Peoples and the key people in post-secondary education whose roles support, lead, and build Indigenization. Our combined strengths give us balance and the ability to steer and paddle in unison as we sit side by side. The paddles are the open resources. As we learn to pull together, we understand that our shared knowledge makes us stronger and makes us one.</p> <p>The perpetual motion and depth of water reflects the evolving process of Indigenization. Indigenization is relational and collaborative and involves various levels of transformation, from inclusion and integration to infusion of Indigenous perspectives and approaches in education. As we learn together, we ask new questions, so we continue our journey with curiosity and optimism, always looking for new stories to share.</p> <p>We hope these guides support you in your learning journey. As open education resources they can be adapted to fit local context, in collaboration with Indigenous Peoples who connect with and advise your institution. We expect that as more educators use and revise these guides, they will evolve over time.</p> <h2>How to use and adapt this guide</h2> <p><em>A Guide for Front-Line Staff, Student Services, and Advisors</em>&nbsp;explores relationships between the institution, students, and Indigenous communities. These relationships are interconnected and are guided by shared values of Indigenization to both improve the educational and employment experiences of all students, faculty, and staff across the institution. It also explores how Elders, Indigenous community members, and community education partners are heard and included in the educational experience. This guide reflects a holistic way to serve Indigenous students.</p> <p>This guide can be used as part of a learning community or in a group learning experience, adapting and augmenting it to include Indigenization pathways at your institution for Indigenous students and communities.</p> <p>The <em>Guide for Front-line Staff, Student Services, and Advisors</em>&nbsp;is not a definitive resource, since First Nation, Métis and Inuit perspectives and approaches are diverse across the province.

One negative experience can cause harm and mistrust. Positive experiences help Indigenous students feel respected and help to build their trust with staff and faculty. This can lead to future generations wanting to further their post-secondary education. This guide is an opportunity for you to better understand Indigenous students and to figure out ways both you and your area or department can work to ensure supportive student experiences. By pulling together we can facilitate student success and contribute to long-term improvements for all Indigenous students and communities.</p> </div><div class="footnotes"><div id='4-1'>The “Green Report” is the Report of the Provincial Advisory Committee on Post-Secondary Education for Native Learners.

Intercultural learning is a way to hold more than one view in an equitable way. How you perceive other cultures and the ability to view from a different culture takes personal reflection, education, and conscious effort. While there is no way you can totally understand another’s culture, you can be aware of your own culture and your position in a growing relationship.</p> <p>As you work through this section, take a moment to reflect on the following questions:</p> <ul><li>What do you hold as important when you work with students?</li> <li>Do you sometimes not understand why an interaction with a student goes the way it does? Is it because of miscommunication or a cultural misconnection?</li> <li>Do you take the time to try to see a situation from another viewpoint?</li> </ul> <div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Purpose of this section</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content"><p>This section is intended to help you develop an understanding of the meaning and importance of Indigenization, decolonization, and reconciliation, and how you can participate in Indigenization at your institution.

On the one hand, decolonization involves dismantling structures that perpetuate the status quo and addressing unbalanced power dynamics. On the other hand, decolonization involves valuing and revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and approaches and weeding out settler biases or assumptions that have impacted Indigenous ways of being. For non-Indigenous people, decolonization is the process of examining your beliefs about Indigenous Peoples and culture by learning about yourself in relationship to the communities where you live and the people with whom you interact.</p> <p>We work in systems that perpetuate colonial ideals and privilege Western ways of doing. For example, many student services use forms and procedures instead of first initiating relationships with students. This is a colonial process that excludes rather than includes. Also, how libraries catalogue knowledge is Western and colonial.</p> <p>Decolonization is an ongoing process that requires all of us to be collectively involved and responsible. Decolonizing our institutions means we create spaces that are inclusive, respectful, and honour Indigenous Peoples.</p> <p>The call for decolonizing education and including Indigenous ways of knowing and being in education was first articulated in 1972 in <a href="http://www.oneca.com/IndianControlofIndianEducation.pdf" data-url="http://www.oneca.com/IndianControlofIndianEducation.pdf">“Indian control of Indian education” [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="29-1"></span></span> by the National Indian Brotherhood (now the Assembly of First Nations).</p> <p>“We want education to give our children the knowledge to understand and be proud of themselves and the knowledge to understand the world around them.” (p. 1)</p> <h2>Indigenization</h2> <p><a href="#Indigenization" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#Indigenization"><strong>Indigenization</strong></a> is a collaborative process of naturalizing Indigenous intent, interactions, and processes and making them evident to transform spaces, places, and hearts. In the context of post-secondary education, this involves including Indigenous perspectives and approaches. Indigenization benefits not only Indigenous students but all students, teachers, staff members, and community members involved or impacted by Indigenization.</p> <p>Indigenization seeks not only relevant programs and support services but also a fundamental shift in the ways that institutions:</p> <ul><li>Include Indigenous perspectives, values, and cultural understandings in policies and daily practices.</li> <li>Position Indigenous ways of knowing at the heart of the institution, which then informs all the work that we do.</li> <li>Include cultural protocols and practices in the operations of our institutions.</li> </ul> <p>Indigenization values sustainable and respectful relationships with First Nation, Métis, and Inuit communities, Elders, and organizations. When Indigenization is practiced at an institution, Indigenous people see themselves represented, respected, and valued and all students benefit. Indigenization, like decolonization, is an ongoing process, one that will shape and evolve over time.</p> <p>Indigenization is not an “Indigenous issue,” and it is not undertaken solely to benefit Indigenous students. Indigenization benefits everyone; we all gain a richer understanding of the world and of our specific location in the world through awareness of Indigenous knowledge and perspectives. Indigenization also contributes to a more just world, creating a shared understanding that opens the way toward reconciliation between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people. It also counters the impacts of&nbsp;colonization by upending a system of thinking that has typically discounted Indigenous knowledge and history.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='29-1'>Indian control of Indian education: http://www.oneca.com/IndianControlofIndianEducation.pdf</div></div></div></div>

It also requires us to help influence change in the broader systems and societies within which we operate. “[I]nstitutional reform must be undertaken on multiple levels, by all peoples in the academic community, and result in a dramatically different structure, relationships, goals, and outcomes” (Pete, 2016, p. 81). We must go beyond having “decolonization as a metaphor” (Tuck &amp; Yang, 2012) but as conscious, living part of our lives.</p> <p>Working together encourages us to think of decolonization as a reciprocal partnership required for Indigenous people to participate meaningfully in the opportunities offered by our institutions. This means examining how students come in to institutions, how they move throughout the supports, and how to support positive transformation and self-determination.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-pathways-toward-reconciliation" title="Pathways Toward Reconciliation"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">4</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Pathways Toward Reconciliation</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <blockquote><p>Reconciliation is not an Aboriginal problem – it involves all of us.</p> <p>– Chief Justice Murray Sinclair (CBC, 2015)</p></blockquote> <h2>Reconciliation</h2> <p><a href="#reconciliation" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#reconciliation"><strong>Reconciliation</strong></a> is about addressing past wrongs done to Indigenous Peoples, making amends, and improving relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to create a better future for all.</p> <p>The work of Indigenization is a growing focus in this era of reconciliation, which has been driven forward by the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC), a multi-year investigation of the residential school system. The TRC gathered information in a variety of ways about the historical and contemporary injustices toward Indigenous Peoples from across the nation. The release of the <em>Honouring the Truth, Reconciling the Future: Summary of</em> <em>Final Report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission</em> in June of 2015 marked an important moment in the history of Canada. In the context of reconciliation, Indigenization is one way in which we can contribute to working toward a stronger shared future as Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.</p> <p>The report, with its 94 Calls to Action, emphasizes the need for education to play a key role in service of justice and resurgence of Indigenous Peoples, and Indigenous communities are looking at post-secondary institutions to be leaders in responding to the TRC Calls to Action and in working to support Indigenous education in meaningful, concrete, and sustainable ways. Essential to this work is placing Indigenous perspectives at the centre of the work being done, or, as Marie Battiste has said, “Nothing about us without us” (quoted in Cote-Meek, 2017). It means we are moving towards processes of truth and reconciliation and transforming the educational system into spaces that are inclusive, respectful, and honour Indigenous people.</p> <p>Given the colonial context of Canadian education, there is work to be done to decolonize our policies and practices to de-centre Western approaches and being to re-centre Indigenous ways of knowing, being, learning, and teaching. Mindful of the need for truth and reconciliation, this work is guided by a relatively straightforward question:</p> <p><em>Are we making the institution a better place for those who come after us? </em></p> <p>While the recent context of reconciliation has brought new levels of attention to this work, we acknowledge the long history of Indigenous faculty and staff and allies in supporting Indigenous students and advocating for change within institutions, and respectfully working to empower Indigenous communities.</p> </div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-moving-forward-reconciling-intent-purpose-and-practice" title="Moving Forward, Reconciling Intent, Purpose, and Practice"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">5</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Moving Forward, Reconciling Intent, Purpose, and Practice</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Moving forward means ongoing self-reflection and assessment of one’s own individual roles and responsibilities to supporting Indigenous students, and the following sections will guide you through this process. Moving forward also must come with clear financial and human resources support to provide ongoing professional development opportunities and targeted hiring practices.</p> <p>When surveyed, BC Aboriginal post-secondary coordinators indicated that hiring Indigenous people in student services and other front-line services as the most supportive way to help with Indigenization in an institution.</p> <p>Front-line services also require a way to transform institutional culture so the values of Indigenization continue. Too often, champions who initiate Indigenized practices and relationships are recognized as innovators to the department and institution; very rarely do these practices and relationships become common procedure or guiding policy. When the champion retires or changes jobs, the practice and relationship ceases. Staff engaging in this decolonizing, Indigenizing, and reconciliation practice need to be supported in their intentions, and they need to have space and time to discuss the challenges and celebrate areas of growth and success.</p> <h2>Becoming an ally</h2> <p>Acknowledging the overt and systemic forms of racism and discrimination within public post-secondary institutions is a core part of decolonization. It’s also important to understand that by shifting individual mindsets and practices, we can make structural changes in institutional cultures, policies, and programs, thus Indigenizing the institution and ourselves. Becoming an <a href="#ally" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#ally"><strong>ally</strong></a> is an important practice that addresses how to do this.</p> <p>An&nbsp;ally&nbsp;is someone from a privileged group who is aware of how oppression works and struggles alongside members of an oppressed group to take action to end oppression. Anne Bishop explains:</p> <p>Allies are people who recognize the unearned privilege they receive from society’s patterns of injustice and take responsibility for changing these patterns. Allies include men who work to end sexism, white people who work to end racism, heterosexual people who work to end heterosexism, able-bodied people who work to end ableism, and so on. Part of becoming an ally is also recognizing one’s own experience of oppression. For example, a white woman can learn from her experience of sexism and apply it in becoming an ally to people of colour, or a person who grew up in poverty can learn from that experience how to respect others’ feelings of helplessness because of a disability.</p> <p>If you are a non-Indigenous person engaged in the work of Indigenization, you can better understand your role in this movement as being an&nbsp;ally&nbsp;to Indigenous people.&nbsp;An&nbsp;ally:</p> <ul><li>does not put their own needs, interests, and goals ahead of the Indigenous people they are working with.</li> <li>has self-awareness of their own identity, privilege, and role in challenging oppression.</li> <li>is engaged in continual learning and reflection about Indigenous cultures and history.</li> </ul> </div></div>

Every day, Indigenous students interact with staff in student services, academic advising, libraries, bookstores, and counselling services. This section considers ways we can ensure that we respect Indigenous identities and provide an environment that is accessible, inclusive, and safe for all students. We look at the diversity of Indigenous students and how their identity is often threatened by stereotypes and myths. We also explore Indigenous ways of knowing and being. To be an ally, it is helpful to understand how Indigenous students’ needs and worldviews differ from other student populations.</p> <div class="textbox textbox--learning-objectives"><div class="textbox__header"><p class="textbox__title">Purpose of this section</p> </div> <div class="textbox__content">In this section, we look at how diverse Indigenous post-secondary students are.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-indigenous-student-diversity" title="Indigenous Student Diversity"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">8</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Indigenous Student Diversity</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Indigenous students attending BC post-secondary institutions represent over 600 distinct <a href="#FirstNations" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#FirstNations"><strong>First Nations</strong></a>, <a href="#Metis" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#Metis"><strong>Métis</strong></a>, and <a href="#Inuit" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#Inuit"><strong>Inuit</strong></a> communities from across Canada. Many institutions also recognize Native Americans as Indigenous students. Indigenous student enrolment is increasing, and these students approach post-secondary through two streams:</p> <ul><li>High school graduates (in 2015/16 the <a href="http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reports/pdfs/ab_hawd/Public.pdf" data-url="http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reports/pdfs/ab_hawd/Public.pdf">Ministry of Education reported [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="43-1"></span></span> 64 percent of Indigenous students completed high school, an increase of 7 percent in the past six years)</li> <li>Non-traditional students (mature students without Grade 12 credentials who are upgrading their high school marks)</li> </ul> <p>Indigenous students are also parents and community leaders with a great breadth and depth of life experience. Some students will come to post-secondary institutions confident in who they are as Indigenous people; they have grown up within their culture, understand their language, and are strongly affirmed in their identities. Others, due to systemic impacts of colonization, such as residential schools, the 60s scoop, intergenerational trauma, and lost family histories, will come to post-secondary education in search (or even in denial) of their Indigenous identities. Indigenous identities are further complicated by where students grew up. Whether a student grew up in an urban centre or rural community or off-reserve or on-reserve will have an impact on their Indigenous identity.</p> <h2>Support services within post-secondary institutions</h2> <p>Keeping this diversity in mind, providing culturally relevant support services is critical to Indigenous student success. Many of the post-secondary institutions have either departments or Indigenous academic coordinators or advisors<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="43-2"></span></span> for students to connect and interact throughout their enrolment and completion of programs.</p> <p>The role of the an Indigenous academic coordinator has not always been easy to define as Janice Simcoe from Camosun College noted in 2002:</p> <blockquote><p>From the first days, we realized that the position of First Nations coordinator is a challenging one. It is one thing to say that these positions were supposed to support student success. It was quite another to define what that meant and develop ways to do it. We needed to examine the academic, financial, social, and cultural needs of the students we had been hired to support, and establish or learn ways to help them meet these needs. That was, and continues to be, an extraordinary challenge … Over the years we have evolved. There were only about nine of us at that first gathering. Now there are at least 52 people in the system who have official responsibility to promote First Nations student success. (Ministry of Advanced Education, p. 1-2)</p></blockquote> <p>Today Indigenous academic coordinators or advisors support Indigenous student diversity by meeting them where they are at in their cultural and community identity. Students will seek out different things; for instance:</p> <ul><li>Students learning more about who they are as an Indigenous person will often seek cultural supports for their personal journey to make a deeper connection to their culture or understand what it means to be Indigenous.</li> <li>Students secure in their cultural identity will seek a feeling of community, and make the Indigenous student services department their culturally safe home away from home.</li> </ul> <p>If your campus has an Indigenous student services department, the advisors or coordinators in this department can be a great support for Indigenous students and for anyone wanting advice about Indigenous issues. It’s important to keep in mind that people working in Indigenous student services are often very busy as the holistic services they provide also includes connecting with Indigenous communities; depending upon how many Indigenous advisors and coordinators are in your institution, you may or may not have a delayed response to your requests.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='43-1'>Ministry of Education Report: http://www.bced.gov.bc.ca/reports/pdfs/ab_hawd/Public.pdf</div><div id='43-2'>The BC Aboriginal Post-Secondary Advisory (BCAPSA) is a network of advisors and coordinators from across the province who provide services and supports to Indigenous students and work with Indigenous communities.</div></div></div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-myths-that-impact-indigenous-student-experience" title="Myths that Impact Indigenous Student Experience"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">9</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Myths that Impact Indigenous Student Experience</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Indigenous students are not always in culturally safe spaces on campus. The concept of <a href="#culturalsafety" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#culturalsafety"><strong>cultural safety</strong></a> recognizes that we need to be aware of and challenge unequal power relations at all levels: individual, family, community, and society. The reality is that many Indigenous students experience racial <a href="#microaggressions" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#microaggressions"><strong>microaggressions</strong></a> daily and this ongoing harm creates feelings of isolation and unwelcomeness. A racial microaggression is a “subtle behaviour that [conveys] hostile, derogatory, or negative messages to persons of marginalized groups” (Shotton, 2017, p. 33). Negative messages are based on myths and stereotypes. Below are a few common misconceptions to dispel as you work with Indigenous students and build your allyship.</p> <h2>Indigenous students get 100 percent free education</h2> <p><strong>Not all Indigenous students receive funding</strong>. There is a federal funding program called the <a href="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100033682/1100100033683" data-url="https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100033682/1100100033683">Post-Secondary Student Support program</a>,<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="45-1"></span></span>&nbsp;but only status First Nations and Inuit post-secondary students are eligible for funding under this program. This program is underfunded, with little budgetary increase since the mid-1990s. This causes First Nations and Inuit-designated organizations, who administer the annual allotted funds to their membership, to ration who, how, and what is funded. For example, some eligible students will have just their books and supplies paid for while others will get their tuition if they enrol full-time. Some programs may not be eligible for funding, including any continuing education programs and some online programs. For those students who must relocate to attend college or university, costs such as housing, day care, and transportation, are often not covered. Métis and non-status First Nations students are not eligible for Post-Secondary Student Support funding, so they must seek student aid, scholarships, and bursaries. Métis students can also apply to Métis Nation BC for post-secondary funding through its <a href="https://www.mnbc.ca/directory/view/342-ministry-of-employment-training" data-url="https://www.mnbc.ca/directory/view/342-ministry-of-employment-training">Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program</a>,<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="45-2"></span></span> which is funded by Employment and Social Development Canada. Moreover, BC First Nations who have signed modern treaty agreements (for example, Nisga’a First Nation, Maa-nulth First Nations, Tsawwassen First Nation, Tla’min First Nation) no longer have access to the Post-Secondary Support Program and may or may not be able to provide post-secondary funding to their members. For more information about funding programs for Indigenous students, please see <a href="#back-matter-appendix-b" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/appendix-b/">Appendix B</a>.</p> <h2>Indigenous students are “underprepared”</h2> <p><strong>Not Quite. </strong>Many Indigenous students are the first generation of learners to attend a post-secondary institution, so they may not know the processes involved in enrolment, transition, and graduation. Some students may need academic support to transition to the post-secondary classroom (for example, they may require tutors or academic support for numeracy, literacy, and technology); however, many will come fully prepared academically.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p> <h2>Students of mixed ancestry are Métis</h2> <p><strong>Not all “mixed blood” people are </strong><strong>Métis</strong><strong>. </strong>The Métis are members of an Indigenous nation with roots in the North American fur trade. While some of their ancestors are European, the salient characteristic of Métis identity is based on shared histories, cultural practices, and community life. A person is Métis because they are descended from Métis ancestors and recognized by Métis relatives and communities, not because they are of mixed ancestry (Hancock, 2017).

For example, not all Indigenous people come from poverty, suffer from violence, or have lived on reserve. Understanding students’ socio-political circumstances is helpful in your role as an ally and service provider as is understanding the effects of colonization, residential schools, and other complex systemic issues facing Indigenous Peoples. However, we should not assume all students come from the same circumstance and that Indigenous people are all harmed.</p> <h2>Indigenous students are “spiritual”</h2> <p><strong>Indigenous students are culturally diverse. </strong>Not all Indigenous people have the same spiritual practices. For example, not all Indigenous Peoples take part in smudging ceremonies or pow wows (these are primarily practiced on the prairies), and not all Indigenous people participate in feasts and potlatches (these traditions are practiced by Indigenous Peoples on the Northwest Coast). Spiritual practices are influenced by worldviews, language, and practices. Also, the effects of colonization, such as residential schools, mean some Indigenous students also practice faith-based religions either alongside or separate from their traditional cultural practices. Spirituality must be thought of as diverse as Indigenous Peoples themselves and we can’t make assumptions about what role spirituality plays in an Indigenous person’s life without knowing the individual.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='45-1'>Post-Secondary Student Support program: https://www.aadnc-aandc.gc.ca/eng/1100100033682/1100100033683</div><div id='45-2'>Indigenous Skills and Employment Training Program: https://www.mnbc.ca/directory/view/342-ministry-of-employment-training</div><div id='45-3'>Métis Bibliography: http://solr.bccampus.ca:8001/bcc/file/c0a932f4-8d79-4d3d-a5d4-3f8c128c0236/1/FINAL%20Metis%20Bibliography%20for%20Indigenization%20Guides%202017.pdf</div></div></div></div>

Indigenous worldviews see the whole person (physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual) as interconnected to land and in relationship to others (family, communities, nations). This is called a <a href="#holism" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#holism"><strong>holistic</strong></a> or <a href="#holism" data-url="/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/back-matter/glossary-of-terms/#holism"><strong>wholistic</strong></a> view, which is an important aspect of supporting Indigenous students. The Canadian Council of Learning produced <a href="http://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/education2/state_of_aboriginal_learning_in_canada-final_report,_ccl,_2009.pdf" data-url="http://www.afn.ca/uploads/files/education2/state_of_aboriginal_learning_in_canada-final_report,_ccl,_2009.pdf"><em>State of Aboriginal Learning in Canada: A holistic approach to measuring success</em> [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="47-1"></span></span> to support diversity of Indigenous knowledges from First Nations, Métis, and Inuit perspectives. Across all three of these perspectives, relationships and connections guide the work of supporting Indigenous students.</p> <p>The Indigenous wholistic framework<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="47-2"></span></span> (Figure 2.2 below) illustrates Indigenous values and ways of being and the direct relationship and connection between academic programs and students services in supporting Indigenous students. Kirkness and Barnhardt (1991) first provided post-secondary institutions with the 4Rs to supporting Indigenous students: <strong>r</strong>especting Indigenous knowledge, <strong>r</strong>esponsible relationships, <strong>r</strong>eciprocity, and <strong>r</strong>elevance. This was further elaborated by Pidgeon with the Indigenous wholistic framework, which is just one of many models that have been used to think about the wholistic student experience, particularly Indigenous student success (Pidgeon, 2012, 2016a). This framework is not meant to be a model that treats all Indigenous Peoples as the same but a model to show how the diversity of Indigenous understandings of place, language, and cultures relates to the individual, faculty, and community, both institutional and Indigenous communities within and outside the institution. An Indigenous learner who is balanced in all realms (physical, intellectual, spiritual, emotional) and empowered in terms of who they are as an Indigenous person has their cultural integrity (Tierney &amp; Jun, 2011) not only valued but honoured as they go through their post-secondary journey.</p> <div class="wp-caption aligncenter" id="attachment_49" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49" style="width: 457px"><img src="https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework.png" alt="&amp;quot;&amp;quot;" width="457" height="445" class="wp-image-49 size-full" srcset="https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework.png 457w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework-300x292.png 300w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework-65x63.png 65w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework-225x219.png 225w, https://opentextbc.ca/indigenizationfrontlineworkers/wp-content/uploads/sites/237/2018/06/IndigenousHolisticFramework-350x341.png 350w" title="" /><div class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-49">Fig 2.2: Indigenous wholistic framework.</div></div> <p>This Indigenous wholistic framework provides guiding principles to ensure post-secondary institutions become accessible, inclusive, safe, and successful places for Indigenous students as follows:</p> <h2>Respect</h2> <ul><li>Encompasses an understanding of and practicing community protocols.</li> <li>Honours Indigenous knowledges and ways of being.</li> <li>Considers in a reflective and non-judgmental way what is being seen and heard.</li> </ul> <h2>Responsibility</h2> <ul><li>Is inclusive of students, the institution, and Indigenous communities; also recognizes one’s own connections to various communities.</li> <li>Continually seeks to develop and sustain credible relationships with Indigenous communities.

This relationship is commonly expressed as, “We belong to the land, the land doesn’t belong to us,” foregrounding the idea that&nbsp;our role is as stewards for coming generations.

It includes the territory acknowledgements of post-secondary institutions across Canada and states:</p> <blockquote><p>While acknowledging territory is very welcome, it is only a small part of cultivating strong relationships with the First Peoples of Canada. Acknowledging territory and First Peoples should take place within the larger context of genuine and ongoing work to forge real understanding, and to challenge the legacies of colonialism. Territorial acknowledgements should not simply be a pro forma statement made before getting on with the “real business” of the meeting; they must be understood as a vital part of the business.</p></blockquote> <div class="footnotes"><div id='58-1'>First Nations of British Columbia: http://moa.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/SchoolProgram-FirstNationsMap.pdf</div><div id='58-2'>Guide to Acknowledging First Peoples and Traditional Territory: https://www.caut.ca/content/guide-acknowledging-first-peoples-traditional-territory</div></div></div></div>
<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-elders" title="Elders"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">14</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Elders</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>Elders are very important to Indigenous communities as they are central to keeping traditional wisdom and cultural knowledge alive and passing it forward. Their “credentials” are not determined by a university or other institution, but by their people and other knowledge holders, based on their lived experiences and their recognition as keepers of knowledge.</p> <p>Elders are closely connected to land, language, and culture. Their insights and guidance shape the mission and programming of Indigenous units and departments, and institutions as a whole. Their involvement –&nbsp;and often, simply their presence – supports students, staff, and faculty, both in terms of the relationships they uphold and as role models of their cultural and emotional support and physical presence.</p> <p>Ideally, Elders’ guidance touches all levels of the institution from the senior administration to the day-to-day experiences of students.</p> </div></div>

In Aboriginal thought, the Spirit enters this earth walk with a purpose for being here and with specific gifts for fulfilling that purpose … Our individual gifts for fulfilling our purpose are expressed in ourselves, in our growing talents, and in our emerging of shifting interests (p. 15).</p></blockquote> <p>As more and more Indigenous students enter post-secondary institutions, we need to examine processes of reclaiming culture and reframing identity and relationships through the services and supports offered across the institution to ensure transformation can occur and there is joy in learning.</p> </div></div>

The focus and practices of the department are then influenced by the institutional leadership, such as direct supervisors, senior executive and other community partners. The relationships that an institution, unit, and staff have with local Indigenous communities and organizations within and outside the institution are important.

<div class="chapter standard" id="chapter-building-responsible-relationships" title="Building Responsible Relationships"><div class="chapter-title-wrap"><h3 class="chapter-number">21</h3><h2 class="chapter-title">Building Responsible Relationships</h2></div><div class="ugc chapter-ugc"> <p>We can accomplish so much more working together than working on our own. This is true for teams, units, departments, and institutions. It is important to be engaged in working for the common good, within the considerations of decolonization and Indigenization, and to recognize our individual and institutional role in ensuring responsibility and accountability.</p> <p>A key principle of decolonization and Indigenization is that each person within an institutional community is responsible to these relationships. Every front-line staff member and student affairs professional is accountable to their unit and director, who are then accountable to the senior leadership. The interconnections of the relationships we have working within an institution and across the British Columbia post-secondary system is critically important to improve Indigenous student success in this province.</p> <p>Recognizing that each of us is part of the relationship towards truth and reconciliation, we can enact it through our participation and active engagement. This engagement builds upon the concept of reciprocal relationships. As defined by Verna Kirkness and Ray Barnhardt (1991), we “are in a position to create a new kind of education, to formulate new paradigms or explanatory frameworks that help us establish a greater equilibrium and congruence between the literate view of the world and the reality we encounter when we step outside the walls of the ‘Ivory Tower’” (p. 12). Essentially, these reciprocal relationships create opportunities for learning between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people that improve understanding and inclusion of Indigenous ways of knowing and being within the academy. In ways similar to the <a href="http://www.trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf" data-url="http://www.trc.ca/assets/pdf/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf">TRC (2015) Calls to Action [PDF]</a>,<span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="82-1"></span></span> this collective reciprocal responsibility ensures that we are all part of the journey as a community.</p> <h2>Connecting with others working toward Indigenization</h2> <p>You can find others in your institution who are working toward Indigenization, decolonization, and reconciliation, and build connections between your existing communities and create new and different relationships. Many post-secondary institutions have Indigenous plans or strategic documents that describe their commitment to Indigenization. These plans vary widely from institution to institution, and some institutions are working on new or revised versions. There may be opportunities to get involved in this work where your perspective as a front-line worker is important to share.</p> <div class="footnotes"><div id='82-1'>

We can all play a role in Indigenization and work to provide better access for Indigenous students, include Indigenous worldviews and perspectives in our systems, and provide welcoming spaces for all students.</p> <p>We hope you have found this guide helpful in your own journey to better support Indigenous student success. When we pull together, we move forward with purpose, honour, humility, love, and respect.</p> <p>In concluding, let’s consider the words of Angus Graeme, president of Selkirk College:</p> <blockquote><p>What does Indigenization look like in 25 years? I believe that for a college to be successful, Indigeneity will be so engrained in the governance, operations, courses, programs, and services at the college that the term <em>Indigenization</em> will no longer be needed. Indigenous students will be confident and successful, proud of who they are, and proud of their cultures, traditions, and languages. We will have increased the number of faculty and staff who identify as Indigenous. The college will be a vibrant place of learning. Wouldn’t it be amazing if 25 years from now (if not sooner!) the president of the college were an Indigenous person and a Selkirk College alumni? (Harrison et al., <em>Leaders and Administrators Guide</em>, 2018)</p></blockquote> </div></div>

Decolonization involves valuing and revitalizing Indigenous knowledge and approaches, and weeding out Western biases or assumptions that have impacted Indigenous ways of being</p> <p><strong>First Nations<a id="FirstNations" data-url=""></a></strong>: the accepted term for people who are Indigenous and who do not identify as Inuit or Métis. Today there are around 630 First Nations in Canada.</p> <p><strong>holism/wholistic view<a id="holism" data-url=""></a></strong>: An Indigenous worldview that sees the whole person (physical, emotional, spiritual, and intellectual) as interconnected to land and in relationship to others (family, communities, nations)</p> <p><strong>Indigenization<a id="Indigenization" data-url=""></a></strong> the collaborative process of naturalizing Indigenous intent, interactions, and processes and making them evident to transform spaces, places, and hearts.

Their ancestors were French and Scottish men who migrated to Canada in the 17th and 18th centuries to work in the fur trade and who had children with First Nations women and then formed new communities. The families and their descendants were most often referred to as Métis (from the French for “to mix”).</p> <p><strong>microaggressions<a id="microaggressions" data-url=""></a></strong>: brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioural, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, which communicate hostile, derogatory, or negative slights, invalidations, and insults to an individual or group because of their marginalized status in society.</p> <p><a id="reconciliation" data-url=""></a><strong>reconciliation</strong>: addressing past wrongs done to Indigenous Peoples, making amends, and improving relationships between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people to create a better future for all.</p> </div></div>

The self-assessment is a new tool developed for this professional learning series, so it does not have a history of testing and revision. However, you can adapt and modify the assessment to suit your institution’s priorities on Indigenization, decolonization, and reconciliation. The framework follows the format of the Indigenized integral model (intention, community, behaviour, and systems fit) while the competencies amalgamate and sort other competency models for post-secondary service professionals.</p> <p>The framework provides staff in post-secondary institutions with the tools to assess their levels of competency working with Indigenous students and communities. It’s an opportunity to systematically measure a level of baseline professional competency and skill for monitoring, as well as to regularly track competency levels for professional development.</p> <p>This framework is informed by and reflects the following models and scholarship:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://solr.bccampus.ca:8001/bcc/file/c0a932f4-8d79-4d3d-a5d4-3f8c128c0236/1/Audience%20Profiles%20portrait.pdf" data-url="http://solr.bccampus.ca:8001/bcc/file/c0a932f4-8d79-4d3d-a5d4-3f8c128c0236/1/Audience%20Profiles%20portrait.pdf">Indigenized integral model [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="6-1"></span></span> shared by the Indigenization Project Steering Committee (2017) as the framework for the learning series</li> <li>Scholarship of Pidgeon (2018, 2016) and others</li> <li><a href="http://www.myacpa.org/docs/acpa-naspa-professional-competency-areas-short-versionpdf" data-url="http://www.myacpa.org/docs/acpa-naspa-professional-competency-areas-short-versionpdf">ACPA/NASPA Professional Competencies [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="6-2"></span></span></li> <li><a href="https://www.cacuss.ca/Student_Affairs_and_Services_Competency_Model.html" data-url="https://www.cacuss.ca/Student_Affairs_and_Services_Competency_Model.html">CACUSS Student Affairs and Services Competency Model</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="6-3"></span></span></li> <li><a href="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf" data-url="http://www.trc.ca/websites/trcinstitution/File/2015/Findings/Calls_to_Action_English2.pdf">Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s (2015) Calls to Action [PDF]</a><span class="footnote"><span class="footnote-indirect" data-fnref="6-4"></span></span></li> </ul> <p>Holism guides our perspective on students and student development and differs from traditional views of student development theory and the role of the institution. The CACUSS Competency Model has “student-centred and holistic” as a value (defined as one that “recognizes and values all aspects of a student’s life including physical, intellectual, financial, spiritual, emotional, personal and social” [CACUSS, 2017, p. 7]).</p> <p>The framework measures three areas of professional competencies for working with Indigenous Peoples and community partners: general skills and knowledge, interactive competencies, and self-mastery. These three levels provide front-line staff, advisors, and student services staff with the ability to self-reflect on their current knowledge and create a learning plan to deepen their understanding and change their practice to be more holistic and balanced for all students who seek services and support at post-secondary institutions.</p> <p><strong>General skills and knowledge</strong>: encompasses a foundational knowledge and understanding of Indigenous Peoples and territory on which your institution resides. This foundational competency will also include knowledge of Indigenous history and impact of colonization, the connection to land, and responsible relationships along with an understanding of the rich diversity of Indigenous Peoples, ways of knowing and being, and languages across BC and Canada. General skills will include the ability to identify on- and off-campus resources for Indigenous students as well as the relationship of the institute with local Indigenous communities.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong></p> <p><strong>Interactive competencies:</strong> measures your capacity to assess the ability to provide services to Indigenous students and to understand the systemic barriers faced by Indigenous students. Individuals will be able to identify ways to mitigate systemic challenges within the scope of their role and authority. Engage in trauma-informed practices and build relationships with Indigenous colleagues, Elders, students, and Indigenous community members.</p> <p><strong>Self-mastery: </strong>is your deep level of self-awareness and practice. Individuals will be proficient in providing guidance to other units in ways of respecting Indigenous protocols and ways of being within the academy. Additionally, you will demonstrate ongoing commitment and responsibility to decolonize and Indigenize policies and practices across the institution.</p> <p>The framework explores individual intentions and behaviours within a community and institutional system. Each aspect of the framework (intention, behaviour, community, and systems fit) helps individuals assess their own professional understandings and competencies to decolonize, Indigenize, and reconcile services to Indigenous Peoples. Each aspect does not run sequentially, so when you do the self-assessment and realize there are gaps in your perceptions and knowledge, you can focus on an aspect of the framework and then move to another aspect.</p> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 420px;"><caption>Bear (Intention)</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 23px;"><th style="width: 30%; height: 23px;" scope="col">Proficiency level</th> <th style="width: 80%; height: 23px;" scope="col">Self-assessment criteria</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="height: 167px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 167px;">General knowledge and skills</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 167px;">I am able to: <ul><li>Identify the territory(ies) my institutional campus(es) is built upon.</li> <li>List the services and resources available to Indigenous student on my campus and community.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 103px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 103px;">Interactive competencies</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 103px;"><ul><li>Reflect on my understanding of systemic barriers to Indigenous students and identify ways to mitigate these challenges within the scope of my role and authority.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 127px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 127px;">Self-mastery</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 127px;"><ul><li>Explain how colonization and systemic barriers an ongoing influence on the policies and practices that shape my role and reflect on how I can within scope of authority contribute to improvement.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%; height: 92px;"><caption>Raven (Behaviour)</caption> <thead><tr style="height: 23px;"><th style="width: 30%; height: 23px;" scope="col">Proficiency level</th> <th style="width: 80%; height: 23px;" scope="col">Self-assessment criteria</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr style="height: 23px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 23px;">General knowledge and skills</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 23px;">I am able to: <ul><li>Recognize the importance of fostering intercultural engagement among Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, faculty, and staff.</li> <li>Share information within the institution, and beyond, to inform current and prospective Indigenous students of the array of services, programs and supports available to them.</li> <li>Demonstrate awareness of, and responsiveness to, verbal and non-verbal communication across cultures.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 23px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 23px;">Interactive competencies</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 23px;">I am able to: <ul><li>Engage in self-reflection and recognize the strengths and limitations of my own worldview on my communication with others.</li> <li>Examine my personal beliefs about experiences of trauma and reflect on the impact these have on interactions with Indigenous students, colleagues, organizations and systems.</li> <li>Generate ideas for resources, spaces, and approaches that promote dialogue between Indigenous and non-Indigenous students, staff, and faculty within the institution.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> <tr style="height: 23px;"><td style="width: 30%; height: 23px;">Self-mastery</td> <td style="width: 80%; height: 23px;">I am able to: <ul><li>Collaborate with Indigenous colleagues and students in support of decolonization work to identify and overcome systemic barriers for Indigenous students.</li> <li>Prioritize welcoming and respectful learning environments on campus through the implementation of programs, services, support mechanisms, and spaces dedicated to Indigenous students.</li> <li>Actively promote the importance of Indigenization of curricula (including co-curricula and extra-curricular) through responsive programming, orientations, and instruction.</li> </ul> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;"><caption>Wolf (Community)</caption> <thead><tr><th style="width: 30%;" scope="col">Proficiency level</th> <th style="width: 80%;" scope="col">Self-assessment criteria</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody><tr><td style="width: 30%;">General knowledge and skills</td> <td style="width: 80%;">I am able to: <ul><li>Identify on-campus Indigenous student resources.</li> <li>Explain the importance of Elder and community involvement on campus.

If you’ve created a website using WordPress, you’ll find some similarities working with Pressbooks. &nbsp;Pressbooks allows you to create content once and publish it in many different formats. &nbsp;These export formats enable the resource to be easily imported and edited in different platforms such as WordPress, Wikis and even learning management systems. The formats appear at the bottom of the web version of the resource to allow other users to easily export and adapt the resource. These features will allow the resources we are developing to be used, adapted, contextualized and localized by different institutions and communities. Pressbooks&nbsp;will make the resource more available to different users by giving them the option of accessing it on the web, on their mobile devices or print it out as a PDF document. By designing each part of the resource as a standalone guide institutions will be able to select and adapt the sections to use, edit and adapt for their context. These features will allow the resources we are developing to be used, adapted, contextualized and localized by different institutions and communities.</p> <h3>Export formats</h3> <table style="width: 684px;"><tbody><tr><td class="shaded" style="width: 108.931px;">Print PDF</td> <td class="shaded" style="width: 546.069px;">Allows documents to be easily shared while retaining the same visual formatting.
