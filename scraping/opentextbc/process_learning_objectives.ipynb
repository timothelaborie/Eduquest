This may sound like a silly question with an obvious answer, but it is not easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life. From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how did this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day, bio\n",

Like geology, physics, and chemistry, biology is a science that gathers knowledge about the natural world. Specifically, biology is the study of life. The discoveries of biology are made by a community of researchers who work individually and together using agreed-on methods. In this sense, biology, like all sciences is a social enterprise like politics or the arts.

In this chapter, we will discuss these important building blocks and learn how the unique properties of the atoms of different elements affect their interactions with other atoms to form the molecules of life. These interactions determine what atoms combine and the ultimate shape of the molecules and macromolecules, that shape will determine their function. Food provides an organism with nutrients—the matter it needs to survive. Many of these critical nutrients come in the form of biological macromolecules, or large molecules necessary for life. These macromolecules are built from different combinations of smaller organic molecules. What specific types of biological macromolecules do living things require? How are these molecules formed? What functions do they serve? In this chapter, we will explore these questions. Media Attribution Figure 2.1 by Bengt Nyman © CC BY (Attribution) 3 2.1 The Building Blocks of Molecules \n",

      "Many of us write haphazardly, using strategies we may have evolved as beginning learners. There is something incredibly frustrating in sitting and looking at a blank page, waiting for inspiration to strike. Wondering what to write about and how to start are normal parts of the writing process, and they happen to everyone—even people who make their living as writers. How can you get past the blank page? Prewriting can help. The following strategies—outlines, mind maps, and freewriting—may or may not work for you. Even if they don’t, however, they can help spark ideas for what will—and free you from the dreaded blank page. 3 2.1 Outlines Some writers swear by outlines; others loathe them.

Whether you have been given a topic by your instructor to write on, and your mind is blank, or you have been told to pick your own topic, and your mind is also blank, you can use this technique. Freewriting involves writing for a certain amount of time—say, ten minutes—without taking your pen off the page. This means that you write down anything that comes to mind, even if that is “This is a really stupid exercise. I don’t know why I’m doing it. Wow, am I bored.” The goal is to continue writing for the specified time. There is only one rule: do not stop writing, even for a minute, during the specified time period. Your job is not to think about what you are writing, but to write. Afterwards, you’ll have a chance to go over what you wrote and pick out your favourite parts.

      "A descriptive paragraph provides a vibrant experience for the reader through vivid language and descriptions of something. Unlike narrative paragraphs, which must include personal thoughts, feelings, and growth, descriptive paragraphs do not need to be personal in nature. Instead, descriptive paragraphs must focus on vividly and objectively describing something to the reader. In order to provide this vivid detail, the writer must use language that appeals to the reader’s five senses: sight, smell, sound, taste, and touch. To appeal to these senses, the writer must use descriptive language, usually in the form of adjectives, that describes the sensations felt by the senses. For instance, examine the differences between the descriptions below: Sentence 1 : The tree was tall and green. Sentence 2 : The soft and damp pink flowers of the dogwood tree smelled sweet in the cool spring air as the wind whistled through its yellow-green leaves. How do these descriptions compare?

Their diploma is important to them because it symbolizes their graduation. Their graduation itself is important because it was the first time they saw their grandparents in ten years, at the central park in their hometown, and when they received their diploma. Hence, while in the other descriptive paragraphs, you must never let the event overshadow the significance of the person, place, or object being described, in an event descriptive paragraph, you should focus on how the people, place, and objects surrounding the event make it important. In this way, an event descriptive paragraph is a lot like the person, place, and object paragraphs. Thus, think of the objects, people, and place of an event as the characteristics that make the event important to you whenever you are constructing an event descriptive paragraph. 7 3.2 Narrative Paragraphs \n",

Two types of techniques are used to prevent infection in the hospital setting. The first, medical asepsis , or clean technique , has been used in the past to describe measures for reducing and preventing the spread of organisms (Perry, Potter &amp; Ostendorf, 2014). The second, sterile technique , also known as sterile asepsis , is a strict technique to elimina\n",

Determining pain is an important component of a physical assessment, and pain is sometimes referred to as the “fifth vital sign.” Figure 2.1 Example of a pain scale Pain assessment is an ongoing process rather than a single event (see Figure 2.1). A more comprehensive and focused assessment should be performed when someone’s pain changes notably from previous findings, because sudden changes may indicate an underlying pathological process (Jarvis, Browne, MacDonald-Jenkins, &amp; Luctkar-Flude, 2014).

The two most widely recognized routes for the migration of humans into the region are along the coast and through an interior ice-free corridor. The term Aboriginal refers to the ancestors of these inhabitants and includes the distinct subgroups of Inuit, Métis and First Nations peoples. Pre-contact Aboriginal communities were located throughout BC in three cultural regions identified as the northwest coast, southern Interior, and northern Interior. These three cultural regions had dramatically different ecosystems to which indigenous people adapted. The southern Interior was the most climatically dry, the northern Interior the coldest, and the northwest coast the wettest and richest in terms of animal and plant resources.

Geology is a science, meaning that we use deductive reasoning and scientific methods (see Box 1.1) to understand geological problems. It is, arguably, the most integrated of all of the sciences because it involves the understanding and application of all of the other sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and others. But unlike most of the other sciences, geology has an extra dimension, that of time — deep time — billions of years of it. Geologists study the evidence that they see around them, but in most cases, they are obser\n",

Rocks are made up of mixtures of minerals and can form though igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic processes. 1.5 Fundamentals of Plate Tectonics Convection currents move through Earth’s mantle because the mantle is being heated from below by the hot core. Those convection currents cause the movement of tectonic plates (which are composed of the crust and the uppermost rigid mantle). Plates are formed at divergent boundaries and consumed (subducted) at convergent boundaries. Many important geological processes take place at plate boundaries. 1.6 Geological Time Earth is approximately 4,570,000,000 years old; that is, 4.57 billion years or 4.57 Ga or 4,570 Ma. It’s such a huge amount of time that even extremely slow geological processes can have an enormous impact. II Chapter 2 Minerals \n",

      "Minerals are all around us: the graphite in your pencil, the salt on your table, the plaster on your walls, and the trace amounts of gold in your computer. Minerals can be found in a wide variety of consumer products including paper, medicine, processed foods, cosmetics, and many more. And of course, everything made of metal is also derived from minerals. As defined in Chapter 1, a mineral is a naturally occurring combination of specific elements arranged in a particular repeating three-dimensional structure (Figure 2.1). “Naturally occurring” implies that minerals are not artificially made, although many naturally occurring minerals (e.g., diamond) are also made in laboratories. That doesn’t disqualify them from being minerals. “Specific elements” means that most minerals have a specific chemical formula or composition. The mineral pyrite, for example, is FeS 2 (two atoms of sulphur for each atom of iron), and any significant departure from that would make it a different mineral. But \n",

They all include silica tetrahedra (four oxygens surrounding a single silicon atom) arranged in different structures (chains, sheets, etc.). Some silicate minerals include iron or magnesium and are called ferromagnesian silicates. 2.5 Formation of Minerals Most minerals in the crust form from the cooling and crystallization of magma. Some form from hot water solutions, during metamorphism or weathering, or through organic processes. 2.6 Mineral Properties Some of the important properties for mineral identification include hardness, cleavage/fracture, density, lustre, colour, and streak colour.

      "A volcano is any location where magma comes to the surface, or has done so within the past several million years. This can include eruptions on the ocean floor (or even under the water of lake), where they are called subaqueous eruptions , or on land, where they are called subaerial eruptions . Not all volcanic eruptions produce the volcanic mountains with which we are familiar; in fact most of Earth’s volcanism takes place along the spreading ridges on the sea floor and does not produce volcanic mountains at all — not even sea-floor mountains. Canada has a great deal of volcanic rock, but most of it is old, some of it billions of years old. Only in B.C. and the Yukon are there volcanoes that have been active within the past 2.6 Ma (Pleistocene or younger), and the vast majority of these are in B.C.

Lahars, volcano-related mudflows, can be large enough to destroy entire towns.  Lava flows will destroy anything in their paths, but tend to move slowly enough so that people can get to safety. 4.5 Monitoring Volcanoes and Predicting Eruptions We have the understanding and technology to predict volcanic eruptions with some success, and to ensure that people are not harmed. The prediction techniques include monitoring seismicity in volcanic regions, detecting volcanic gases, and measuring deformation of the flanks of a volcano. 4.6 Volcanoes in British Columbia There are examples of all of the important types of volcanoes in British Columbia, including subduction volcanism north of Vancouver, mantle-plume volcanism along the Nazco trend, and rift-related volcanism in the Wells Gray and Stikine regions.

      "Industrial Revolution Overview The Craftsman Before the Industrial Revolution (1760-1840 in Britain) most aspects of design and all aspects of production were commonly united in the person of the craftsman. The tailor, mason, cobbler, potter, brewer, and any other kind of craftsman integrated their personal design aesthetic into each stage of product development. In print, this meant that the printer designed the fonts, the page size, and the layout of the book or broadsheet; the printer chose (even at times made) the paper and ran the press and bindery. Unity of design was implicit. Typography in this pre-industrial era was predominantly used for books and broadsheets. The visual flavour of the fonts was based on the historic styles of western cultural tradition — roman, black letter, italic, and grotesque fonts were the mainstay of the industry. Typography was naturally small scale — needed only for sheets and pages — and was only large when it was chiseled into buildings and monumen\n",

      "In Greek mythology, Psyche was a mortal woman whose beauty was so great that it rivaled that of the goddess Aphrodite. Aphrodite became so jealous of Psyche that she sent her son, Eros, to make Psyche fall in love with the ugliest man in the world. However, Eros accidentally pricked himself with the tip of his arrow and fell madly in love with Psyche himself. He took Psyche to his palace and showered her with gifts, yet she could never see his face. While visiting Psyche, her sisters roused suspicion in Psyche about her mysterious lover, and eventually, Psyche betrayed Eros’ wishes to remain unseen to her. Because of this betrayal, Eros abandoned Psyche. When Psyche appealed to Aphrodite to reunite her with Eros, Aphrodite gave her a series of impossible tasks to complete. Psyche managed to complete all of these trials; ultimately, her perseverance paid off as she was reunited with Eros and was ultimately transformed into a goddess herself (Ashliman, 2001; Greek Myths &amp; Greek Mytho\n",

As mentioned, anyone interested in exploring issues related to the mind generally did so in a philosophical context prior to the 19th century. Two men, working in the 19th century, are generally credited as being the founders of psychology as a science and academic discipline that was distinct from philosophy. Their names were Wilhelm Wundt and William James. This section will provide an overview of the shifts in paradigms that have influenced psychology from Wundt and James through today. Wundt and Structuralism Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) was a German scientist who was the first person to be referred to as a psychologist.

Hue You will have learned in Hairstylist Foundations that the three primary (or “pure”) colours are red, yellow, and blue.

Oxidant colour molecures. Non-Oxidative Colours Non-oxidative semi and temporary colouring products generally have an acid pH and therefore do not swell the hair strand as much, which makes them a gentler option.

      "British America and New France were both initially established as trading posts, then as colonies of their mother countries in the late 1500s through the early 1700s with the assistance of Indigenous persons in modern-day northeastern United States and eastern Canada. In the 1750s, the French and Indian War was a theatre of the Seven Years’ War fought between Great Britain and France. British colonialists led by James Wolfe triumphed over New France led by Montcalm in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham (Eccles, 2021). However, that victory was not achieved without help from the Iroquois Confederacy, also known as the Five Nations: the Mohawk, Onondaga, Oneida, Cayuga, and Seneca (Bleiweis, 2013). A problem arose in the aftermath of the French and Indian War. Colonials in British America, in search of new land, were travelling west into the continent. On their way, they purchased or stole lands from Indigenous persons, and asked their government to protect their newfound property. This\n",

This series of events led to the heartbreaking Trail of Tears, in which 12,000 people were forcibly marched 1,300 kilometres. Four thousand of those people never made it. Not only was this tragic event permitted in order to avoid a conflict between the national government and the Southern states, but the American Civil War occurred anyway not three decades later (National Park Service, 2020). In Canada, Great Britain continued to assert its role in governing Canada until the British North America Act, 1867 (the first of Canada’s two constitutions). After, the Government of Canada assumed responsibility for its relationship with First Peoples. To this day, the federal government remains responsible for the Crown’s relationship with Indigenous Peoples, although the provinces have been active partners in guiding the actions of the federal government. 2 The Numbered Treaties \n",

      "The first order of business for the Canadian government was twofold: secure land for settlement and the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway to unite the provinces. The Royal Proclamation made it illegal for individuals or businesses to make agreements with Indigenous communities, and the land was explicitly reserved for all Indigenous Peoples. To do this, the government had to purchase lands and so engaged in the process of negotiating the “Numbered Treaties” (Black, 2014). Map of the Numbered Treaties negotiated in the late 1800s to early 1900s. [Numbered Treaties Map image description] The Numbered Treaties remain controversial to this day. The Government of Canada views them as treaties for the legal purchase of land, with modest “reserves” set aside for Indigenous groups (Filice, 2016). Affected groups viewed the treaties as a “right-of-way” or a sharing agreement, or did not understand the language that would have made clear the intent of the Canadian government. Further,\n",

      "Government-funded residential schools opened in the 1880s and operated until 1996. In this system, Indigenous children across Canada were removed from their parents and taught in Christian-run schools. Residential schools operated in various forms before the Indian Act (1876) came into effect. This is because education provisions in treaties were negotiated so that Indigenous youth could “learn the skills of the newcomer society and help them make a successful transition to a world dominated by the strangers” (Miller, 2020). After the passage of the Indian Act, the goals of government-mandated Indigenous education changed. They became about not just learning the tools to succeed in a modern world, but also the assimilation of Indigenous people into Euro-Canadian culture. To achieve this goal, Indigenous youth were separated from their parents, transported to remote locations, given a “white man’s name,” and forbidden to speak their native language. They also attended Anglican or Cathol\n",
      " commissioner would be appointed to resolve land claims and terminate existing treaties. These recommendations were dramatic. The Indian Act is legislation that has numerous flaws, including imposing Canadian law unilaterally on Indigenous groups. Still, it at the very least acknowledged the special status of Indigenous Peoples due to their living on the continent first. The White Paper sought to remove that privilege as a means to equalize the status of all Canadians. The White Paper never became law due to the backlash against it. One of the lasting effects of the White Paper was the formation of Indigenous political groups, including the Union of British Columbia Indian Chiefs (Indigenous Foundations, 2009b). Note that “Indian” is the term used in foundational Canadian documents and is a legal term that remains in use to this day. This is no longer an acceptable form of address outside the strict legal usage. 5 The Constitution Act, 1982, and Court Cases from the 1970s to the 2010s \n",

      "LECTURE 0\n",
      "We often think of baked goods as being sweet, and sweeteners play an important role in the world of food and baking in particular. Sweetness is one of the key elements of taste (which is explored in more detail in the open textbook Nutrition and Labelling for the Canadian Baker ) but sugars play many other important roles in baking, including contributing to texture, colour, and the chemical processes needed for fermentation. Sweetness is only one of the considerations, and this group of ingredients and how they affect different aspects of the baking process is a key to understanding baking science. 13 Sugar Chemistry Chemically, sugar consists of carbon (C), oxygen (O), and hydrogen (H) atoms, and is classified as a carbohydrate .

More information on sugar substitutes and their relative sweetness can be found online. 24 Key Takeaways Key Takeaways Sugar comes from a variety of sources. Our primary sugar, sucrose, comes from two sources: sugar cane and sugar beet, but both these sugars are chemically identical. As a food item, sugars are classed as carbohydrates, being formed from carbon, oxygen, and hydrogen atoms. There are three types of sugar, two of which are most important in their applications for the baker: monosaccharides (simple sugars) and disaccharides (complex sugars). Simple sugars comprise glucose (also known as dextrose), levulose, and galactose. Complex sugars comprise sucrose (our regular sugar), maltose, and lactose. Glucose is the same as dextrose, and fructose is the same as levulose. Relative sweetness varies among the different sugar types, from low as in lactose, to high as in levulose. Sugar has a wide range of applications in baking. III Fats and Oils \n",

This section reviews the common terms used with fats and oils and provides basic information on their relevance in baking and food production. Fats and oils are fundamentally and chemically similar, but oil is liquid, while fat is solid, at room temperature. However, any oil, when sufficiently chilled, will solidify. Conversely, any edible fat will liquefy when sufficiently heated. The various needs of food manufacturers and dietary changes by consumers have determined the evolution of fat manufacturing. To a large extent, vegetable oils have displaced animal fats in food production. Note that the fats and oils discussed here are different from essential oils. The oils we discuss in this section are fixed oils. Stain a piece of paper towel with a fixed oil, such as canola or melted lard, and the stain will remain.

      "The word leavening in the baking trade is used to describe the source of gas that makes a dough or batter expand in the presence of moisture and heat. Leavening agents are available in different forms, from yeast (the organic leavener) to chemical, mechanical, and physical leaveners. Bakers choose the appropriate type of leavening based on the product they are making. 30 Yeast Yeast is a microscopic unicellular fungus that multiplies by budding, and under suitable conditions, causes fermentation. Cultivated yeast is widely used in the baking and distilling industries. History tells us that the early Chaldeans, Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans made leavened bread from fermented doughs. This kind of fermentation, however, was not always reliable and easy to control.

Once opened, it is good for several weeks if properly handled. The conversion ratios for the many brands of dry yeast are shown on the packages. They are about 1:3, dry to compressed. The functions of yeast are twofold: To create carbon dioxide to make the bread rise To mellow or improve the gluten When handling yeast, avoid warm temperatures. Don’t combine yeast with salt. Keep yeast in a cool place, near the freezing temperature. Keep it well wrapped, but allow space for breathing.

      "Despite the differences in their interests, areas of study, and approaches, all psychologists have one thing in common: they rely on scientific methods. Research psychologists use scientific methods to create new knowledge about the causes of behaviour , whereas psychologist-practitioners , such as clinical, counselling, industrial-organizational, and school psychologists, use existing research to enhance the everyday life of others . The science of psychology is important for both researchers and practitioners. In a sense all humans are scientists. We all have an interest in asking and answering questions about our world. We want to know why things happen, when and if they are likely to happen again, and how to reproduce or change them. Such knowledge enables us to predict our own behaviour and that of others. We may even collect data (i.e., any information collected through formal observation or measurement ) to aid us in this undertaking. It has been argued that people are “everyday\n",

      "Biological psychologists are interested in measuring biological, physiological, or genetic variables in an attempt to relate them to psychological or behavioural variables . Because all behaviour is controlled by the central nervous system, biological psychologists seek to understand how the brain functions in order to understand behaviour. Key areas of focus include sensation and perception; motivated behaviour (such as hunger, thirst, and sex); control of movement; learning and memory; sleep and biological rhythms; and emotion. As technical sophistication leads to advancements in research methods, more advanced topics such as language, reasoning, decision making, and consciousness are now being studied. Biological psychology has its roots in early structuralist and functionalist psychological studies, and as with all of the major perspectives, it has relevance today.

Generally, we do not think about rules in a fast food restaurant because they are designed to be casual, quick, and convenient. But if you look around one on a typical weekday, you will see people acting as if they were trained for the role of fast food customer. They stand in line, pick their items from overhead menus before they order, swipe debit cards to pay, and stand to one side to collect trays of food. After a quick meal, customers wad up their paper wrappers and toss them into garbage cans. This is a food system that has become highly rationalized in Max Weber’s terms. Customers’ movement through this fast food routine is orderly and predictable, even if no rules are posted and no officials direct the process. If you want more insight into these unwritten rules, think about what would happen if you behaved according to some other standards. (Yo\n",

      "Introduction Meat science and the research and studies conducted both independently and in conjunction with many industry stakeholders over the last 40 years have provided a greater understanding of the relationship between animal-handling techniques prior to harvesting (slaughter) and the quality of the meat produced. As well, improved practices during and after the harvesting of animals, especially in large processing plants, have contributed to progress in the meat industry. These include improvements to refrigeration and storage, aging of meats (mainly beef and lamb carcasses), and transportation. Additionally, the slaughter process itself has changed over time, and now beef and veal animals are usually stunned with a captive bolt gun (with a retractable bolt penetrating the brain), rendering the animals unconscious prior to bleeding. All of these developments have improved the end product, which ultimately ends up at local meat stores and restaurants. However, even today a small a\n",

Maintain separate cutting and processing boards for different species, especially fish, chicken, and pork. Clean and sanitize boards immediately after use and elevate to air dry as quickly as possible. Have separate cutting boards for cooked meat slicing. Thoroughly clean and sanitize meat slicers and tenderizers between uses for different species and between cooked and raw products. These slicing tools and machines pose a very real risk for cross-contamination and are always subject to scrutiny by health inspectors. If possible, process different species and cooked and raw products on different days. This helps minimize risk of cross-contamination in processing areas, tools, and machines that are used for a variety of products.

      "Introduction Meat inspection for the domestic animal market is mandatory for beef, pork, lamb, bison, and poultry and is overseen by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (CFIA). There are two levels of inspection in Canada: federal and provincial. Federally inspected meats can be sold and transported throughout Canada and also exported or sold internationally. Provincially inspected meats can be sold under the following two categories: Intraprovincially, which means the meat can be sold only within the province where the harvesting plant is located Interprovincially, which means the meat can be sold in a province or territory other than the one in which the harvesting plant is located Meat grading measures the characteristics of carcasses and classifies them into groups of similar quality, yield, and value, which in turn assists in marketing and merchandizing the products.

Studies at the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada Research Station in Lacombe, Alberta, have shown that elk is generally more tender than beef. Currently there are two federally inspected plants in Alberta that accept elk and deer for processing. Wild deer species in B.C., Alberta, and other parts of Canada are not used for farm and meat production. However, some of Canada’s deer species are susceptible to chronic wasting disease (CWD) , which is a progressive, fatal disease of the nervous system. It is known as a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). Other TSEs include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) in humans. In Canada, CWD is a serious concern for deer and elk farmers and is a reportable disease under the Health of Animals Act. All cases must be reported to the CFIA.

      "Introduction You will remember from the first chapter of this book that meat is muscle made up of fibres. These muscle fibres are held together by connective tissue such as collagen and elastin. The amount of connective tissue contained in the muscle (or meat) has to be acknowledged before choosing the appropriate way to prepare the product. A highly exercised muscle, such as a shank or shoulder area, will develop much more connective tissue and more coarse muscle fibres. This means they require a moist heat cooking method. If cooked with liquid, collagen breaks down at 80°C (176°F) into gelatin. This gelatin provides not only body to the cooking liquid but also, more importantly, moisture to the cooked meat and rich flavour. A lightly exercised muscle will contain less connective tissue and more fine muscle fibres, allowing it to be prepared using dry heat cooking methods. Beef tenderloin is a perfect example of this type of meat. Generally, four-legged animals use their shoulder and \n",

      "Today we understand more than we once did about how ingredients of food scientifically interact with one another and how to change them to make them different using methods such as jellifying, powdering, foaming—methods common to what is known as molecular gastronomy . As a result, modern pastry chefs are making amendments to time-honoured recipes to suit the modern palate. They are not cutting corners to make a less professional or delicious product. They are using new technology and knowledge that was not available 100 years ago, and they want to explore the creative side of pastry. This creativity sometimes comes with an expectation of total freedom in the kitchen; an expectation that one will be able to create without following any rules or requiring traditional recipe formats. While it’s good to foster a creative mindset, it’s also important to acknowledge that creativity in baking must also adhere to certain scientific and professional guidelines in order to make well-executed, c\n",

When the surrounding pressure is restored to a normal level, the labyrinth of air-filled spaces collapses. As a result, light tends to pass through the food rather than being scattered and diffused, which is why vacuum-compressed plant foods appear translucent. Causing the porous structure of a plant food to collapse also imparts a somewhat dense, toothsome texture that can give a familiar ingredient, such as watermelon, an entirely new appeal. Figure 5. Infusions When adding liquids, the vacuum-seal process creates a rapid infusion—especially with more porous foods (such as adding spices to cream or herbs to melon). This can add flavour and texture in a shorter time than traditional infusions.

      "What makes a worthy plated dessert? Many will argue presentation, complexity, or the type of plate it is served on are important factors. Texture is also critical in making a dish successful. Mushy apples would ruin an otherwise perfect apple pie, and how helpful is the granulated sugar garnish on the crust? But most will still agree that the most important factor in creating an exceptional plated dessert is flavour. Whether it is a simple slice of pie served in a casual restaurant, or an intricate, multicomponent dessert crafted for a fine dining establishment, flavour is what makes a dessert memorable. Dessert plating styles are constantly changing and evolving thanks to today’s creative pastry chefs and cooks. Past trends included towering architectural assemblies that were impressive and beautiful to look at but were difficult to eat, or making complex designs on the rims of plates with squirts of sauce or dustings of cocoa or icing sugar (which often ended up on the diners’ sleeve\n",
      "ence in a variety of ways. Imagine if food didn’t have the following attributes, which in many cases provide our first impressions, lasting memories, and overall like or dislike of a certain dish or dining experience: Temperature: both real and perceived (such as mint as a cooling sensation or spice as heat) Colour: use a wide palette Shape: create visual interest Texture: some of each creates contrast Mouth feel: dry, fat, rich Smells: avoid overpowering or distracting Sound: noisy, difficult foods may spoil a mood or setting And always try to remember a few guidelines as you go along: Think outside the box; try new things. Too much of anything is never a good idea. Great dishes hit on multiple senses in a variety of ways. Look to classic combinations for inspiration, then make logical leaps. If flavours work together in one context, they will do so in another. A great example of this is the recent trend of bringing savoury pantry items into desserts. III Dessert Garnishes and Sauces \n",

      "LECTURE 2\n",
      "Many, if not most, dessert presentations can be improved with one or more items added to enhance them. But before you add anything, take a moment to consider whether serving the dessert alone would be effective. A simple, ungarnished plating is usually all that’s needed for a home-style dessert, and at the opposite extreme, an elegant pastry or gateaux that is beautiful on its own may not need any additional elements. 8 Garnishes A garnish, simply put, can be just an add-on whose main purpose is decoration. However, carefully selected garnishes have other functions too. This “decorative” item can add important flavour, texture, and functional elements to the plating of the dessert, and can enhance the enjoyment of the dish. Garnishes can solve the problem of serving a frozen component (ice cream or sorbet, for example) as part of a plated dessert. If a scoop of ice cream is placed directly onto the plate, it will start melting immediately, marring the presentation. If that scoop is pla\n",

Another technique for saucing is applying a small amount of sauce and streaking it with a brush, an offset spatula, or the back of a spoon. Sauces are a great way to highlight flavours. Choose ones that will create balance on the plate, not just for colour, but with all the components. A tart berry sauce will complement a rich cheesecake or chocolate dessert because sourness (acid) will cut through fat, making it taste lighter than it is. A sweet sauce served with a sweet dessert will have the overall effect of hiding flavours in both. Hold back on sweetness in order to intensify other flavours. Many modern presentations may have a minimal amount of sauce. Sometimes this is done just for aesthetic reasons and not for how it will complement the dessert. Think of the dish and the balance of the components. This is the most important factor: flavour first, presentation second. IV Dessert Presentation \n",

From creating 2D patterns of 3D objects, to making sure roof panels are installed square, to locating duct runs and penetrations, geometry is used everyday by a sheet metal worker. This is the foundation for which all layout is done. Craftspeople who excel at this stage are able to quickly transform any complex ideas into reality. \n",

The process of pattern development gives us the ability to take that visual representation and actually create the object. It allows us to turn two-dimensional metal into three-dimensional objects, which is the basis for everything we fabricate. Consider a globe and a map. The map is a 2D representation of a 3D object. What should the map look like? Is it truly flat? Well, maybe some would argue, but a map is not a true representation of the Earth until we remove some of it. The actual shape of the map will have numerous “cut outs” which would allow it to form a sphere. This is a form of pattern development. \n",

Auxiliary Line – an extra element line added, different from the standard divisions. Elbow Rule – the number of pieces of a round elbow times 2 then minus 2 (# of pcs × 2 − 2) gives us the number of gores in the elbow. Element Line – a line representing an edge or bend. Elevation View – looking at the front or side of something, to have elevation (height), 2D. Gore – a part of a round elbow which allows us to calculate the miter angle. Miter – an intersection of 2 pieces, an irregular cut on the end of something. Pattern – the shape of the object, still in 2D form. Plan view – looking down at something, a “birds eye view,” “floor plan,” (2D). Profile – a half of a plan view, drawn on the outside of an object. Sector – a special profile which is inside of an object, a section view. Stretch-out -a shape which has been “stretched out,” to take a perimeter \n",
      "allel Line Pattern Development, we required parallel element line or bends. Some objects are of a conical shape and parallel line will not work on them. Rather, we will look at using Radial Line Pattern Development . In radial line, we develop patterns for shapes that have a taper, all element lines (bends) must radiate back to a common point, a radius point. We need two things for this process to work: A radius point that is on centre (right cone). A radius point that is within a reasonable distance. So, when we find ourselves determining if radial line will work, we look at those two things. If the cone is a scalene or oblique cone, it will not work. If a radius point is 40 feet away, it is not worth the effort with this process, another should be chosen, but if it will fit in our bench space, then it will work. Being one of the simplest forms of layout, it allows us to create these patterns with accuracy and speed. If we can use radial line, it is an effective and efficient choice. \n",

      "1 1.1 What is Geology? In its broadest sense, geology is the study of Earth—its interior and its exterior surface, the minerals, rocks and other materials that are around us, the processes that have resulted in the formation of those materials, the water that flows over the surface and through the ground, the changes that have taken place over the vastness of geological time, and the changes that we can anticipate will take place in the near future. Geology is a science, meaning that we use deductive reasoning and scientific methods to understand geological problems. It is, arguably, the most integrated of all of the sciences because it involves the understanding and application of all of the other sciences: physics, chemistry, biology, mathematics, astronomy, and others. But unlike most of the other sciences, geology has an extra dimension, that of time—deep time—billions of years of it. Geologists study the evidence that they see around them, but in most cases, they are observing the\n",

Rocks are made up of mixtures of minerals and can form though igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic processes. 1.5 Fundamentals of Plate Tectonics The Earth’s mantle is convecting because it is being heated from below by the hot core. Those convection currents contribute to the movement of tectonic plates (which are composed of the crust and the uppermost rigid mantle). Plates are formed at divergent boundaries and consumed (subducted) at convergent boundaries. Many important geological processes take place at plate boundaries. 1.6 Geological Time Earth is approximately 4,570,000,000 years old; that is, 4.57 billion years or 4.57 Ga or 4,570 Ma.

      "Minerals are all around us: the graphite in your pencil, the salt on your table, the plaster on your walls, and the trace amounts of gold in your computer. Minerals can be found in a wide variety of consumer products including paper, medicine, processed foods, cosmetics, electronic devices, and many more. And of course, everything made of metal is also derived from minerals. As defined in Chapter 1, a mineral is a naturally occurring combination of specific elements arranged in a particular repeating three-dimensional structure (Figure 1.4.1). “ Naturally occurring ” implies that minerals are not artificially made.  Many minerals (e.g., diamond) can be made in laboratories, but if they can also occur naturally, they still qualify as minerals. “ Specific elements ” means that most minerals have a specific chemical formula or composition.

They all include silica tetrahedra (four oxygens surrounding a single silicon atom) arranged in different structures (chains, sheets, etc.). Some silicate minerals include iron or magnesium and are called ferromagnesian silicates. 2.5 Formation of Minerals Most minerals in the crust form from the cooling and crystallization of magma. Some form from hot water solutions, during metamorphism or weathering, or through organic processes. 2.6 Mineral Properties Some of the important properties for mineral identification include hardness, cleavage/fracture, density, lustre, colour, and streak colour.  It’s critical to be able to recognize these properties in order to be able to identify minerals.

This can include eruptions on the ocean floor (or even under the water of a lake), where they are called subaqueous eruptions , or on land, where they are called subaerial eruptions . Not all volcanic eruptions produce the volcanic mountains with which we are familiar; in fact most of Earth’s volcanism takes place along the spreading ridges on the sea floor and does not produce volcanic mountains at all—not even sea-floor mountains. Canada has a great deal of volcanic rock, but most of it is old, some of it billions of years old. Only in B.C. and the Yukon are there volcanoes that have been active since 2.6 Ma (Pleistocene or younger), and the vast majority of these are in B.C.

      "A working knowledge of taxonomy is useful for classifying, naming, and identifying unknown plants. Theophrastus (370-285 BC), a Greek philosopher, first used taxonomy to describe and group plants according to their morphology (shape), growth, and reproductive traits. In the 18th century, a scientist named Carl Linnaeus applied binomials (two-term names) and classified known plants into a hierarchical system of classification. Classification and Naming The most effective classification systems are hierarchical and comprised of a nested series of categories or ranks. A good analogy is a computer filing system. Certain kinds of information reside at each level (drive, library, directory or folder, sub-directory, document, etc.), with file names (or labels) that signify the sort of information found there. Every level in the hierarchy is more inclusive than the one below it and the more of the filing system that is investigated, the more related information is uncovered. Similarly, the cat\n",
      "other words, the taxa “family” may include numerous plant genera, and within a genus (singular of genera) there may be any number of species, whereas within a given species, a subspecies may describe only a few populations or individuals. Within taxa – family, genus, species, etc., there are identifiable characteristics common to each group. For example, plants in the cypress family typically have broad, flattened, scale leaves, while plants in the pine family exhibit needle-like leaves. Once organized into a sensible system that recognizes similarities or relatedness, the grouping becomes easier to understand and remember. That is, once characteristics for a given group are known, they can be used to match unknown plants with known taxons.

      "The plant family taxon is a grouping of plants consisting of one or more related genera that are more like each other than to other genera, and that includes the entire surviving lineage of the ancestral population. Family names always end with the suffix -aceae, except in a few notable cases where use of traditional names is also acceptable. Newer family names are based on the “type-genus” concept which means that for every family there is a genus that best represents the characteristics of the family. For example, Brassica (the cabbage genus) is the base for the family Brassicaceae, as is Rosa (the rose genus) for the family Rosaceae. Older family names are still used since many are somewhat descriptive and may be more familiar than their newer counterparts. For example, Cruciferae (from the Latin crucifer, a cross) refers to the four-petal arrangement of flowers characteristic of the mustard family.

      "For an orderly system of classification, botanists give each group of plants a name that is recognized by people who know binomial nomenclature, regardless of where they are or the language they speak. This way every plant species will have a unique botanical name based on the binomial system of nomenclature. For example, one of the best-known trees of the Pacific Northwest, the Douglas fir, recognizes botanist Archibald Menzies in its scientific name Pseudotsuga menziesii . While the common name recognizes fellow botanist David Douglas, Archibard Menzies is credited with the first botanical description of the plant. A plant name or binomial is made up of two names: a genus name and a (usually) descriptive specific epithet (species name), both commonly of Latin or Greek origin. For example, of the many species within the group known as pines (genus = Pinus ) there is only one named Pinus contorta (contorta = twisted). This species is characterized by often having contorted or twisted y\n",

For example, the common name “cedar” is a name given to a variety of plants with aromatic wood (recalling the “cedar” of antiquity, Cedrus spp.) or to plants that are reminiscent of other plants called “cedars,” for example. In the Pacific Northwest, cedar refers to Thuja (western red cedar) and to Cupressus (yellow cedar). Similarly, a single species may have numerous common names, particularly if known from a variety of locations. For example, yellow cedar is also known as Nootka cypress and Alaska cedar. Clearly, there is potential for much confusion with common names. In text, common names are written out in lower case, except where they include proper names; e.g., Douglas fir, Japanese painted fern, etc. Common names are not botanical names. While botanical names are often, at least initially, difficult to remember and pronounce, they are universally recognized and considerably more accurate than common names. 5 Conventions for Binomial Nomenclature \n",

Political history is about much more than constitutional history, but the constitution and the division of powers found therein are the ground rules for the Dominion’s governmental processes. As well, the British North America Act functioned in the first three decades of Confederation as a kind of strategic plan. It is highly unusual for a constitution to include provision for a railway; in the BNA Act it stands out like a contractual obligation, and this was a facet that was reinforced in BC’s Terms of Union in 1871. Likewise the BNA Act , and the debates that brought it together, made it clear that Canada was to be a mutual defence pact between a small group of colonies that were highly anxious about American appetites.

And those wage-earning workers were doing so increasingly in industries and factories that did not much resemble what existed in the 1860s. Figure 3.7 As late as 1910, the boundary between rural life and industrial employment was not a great one. The countryside forms a backdrop to a shoe factory in Aurora, Ontario, ca. 1910. Postcards like this one were a way of framing modernization and material progress. Industrialization marked a significant departure from the pre-Confederation economy, and it brought in its wake social and economic changes that could hardly have been predicted. It was, however, part of a conscious strategy for nation-building and making economic policy. The most obvious expression of that strategic (and, yes, hopeful) thinking was the National Policy . \n",

Political history is about much more than constitutional history, but the constitution and the division of powers found therein are the ground rules for the Dominion’s governmental processes. As well, the British North America Act functioned in the first three decades of Confederation as a kind of strategic plan. It is highly unusual for a constitution to include provision for a railway; in the BNA Act it stands out like a contractual obligation, and this was a facet that was reinforced in BC’s Terms of Union in 1871. Likewise the BNA Act , and the debates that brought it together, made it clear that Canada was to be a mutual defence pact between a small group of colonies that were highly anxious about American appetites. Measuring the performance of 19th century governments in particular thus means that we have to look at the tasks they were given and how they interpreted their responsibilities. \n",

      "Language is the most human of all qualities. No human population has been found that doesn’t have language and uses it not just for communication but as an instrument of cultural identity and transmission. Psycholinguistics is a discipline with roots in psychology and linguistics. It combines the theories from both to develop a scientific understanding of language. Given the centrality of language to human culture, its analysis and investigation goes back thousands of years. The earliest formalization of a language was conducted almost 4000 years ago in Babylonia. As Sumerian was considered a language of prestige, word lists of the language were created to help people learn it as a foreign language. A similar position was help by Sanskrit in India.

Astronomers study celestial bodies, biologists study living organisms, and chemists study matter and its properties. It is also not the equipment and techniques that they use. Few biologists would know what to do with a radio telescope, for example, and few chemists would know how to track a moose population in the wild.

      "A Model of Scientific Research in Psychology Figure 1.1 presents a more specific model of scientific research in psychology. The researcher (who more often than not is really a small group of researchers) formulates a research question, conducts a study designed to answer the question, analyzes the resulting data, draws conclusions about the answer to the question, and publishes the results so that they become part of the research literature. Because the research literature is one of the primary sources of new research questions, this process can be thought of as a cycle. New research leads to new questions, which lead to new research, and so on. Figure 1.1 also indicates that research questions can originate outside of this cycle either with informal observations or with practical problems that need to be solved. But even in these cases, the researcher would start by checking the research literature to see if the question had already been answered and to refine it based on what previo\n",

Scientific research in psychology is conducted mainly by people with doctoral degrees in psychology and related fields, most of whom are college and university faculty members. They do so for professional and for personal reasons, as well as to contribute to scientific knowledge about human behaviour. Basic research is conducted to learn about human behaviour for its own sake, and applied research is conducted to solve some practical problem.

      "Can We Rely on Common Sense? Some people wonder whether the scientific approach to psychology is necessary. Can we not reach the same conclusions based on common sense or intuition? Certainly we all have intuitive beliefs about people’s behaviour, thoughts, and feelings—and these beliefs are collectively referred to as folk psychology . Although much of our folk psychology is probably reasonably accurate, it is clear that much of it is not. For example, most people believe that anger can be relieved by “letting it out”—perhaps by punching something or screaming loudly. Scientific research, however, has shown that this approach tends to leave people feeling more angry, not less (Bushman, 2002) . Likewise, most people believe that no one would confess to a crime that he or she had not committed, unless perhaps that person was being physically tortured. But again, extensive empirical research has shown that false confessions are surprisingly common and occur for a variety of reasons (Kass\n",

And social psychologists also study more unusual events, such as how someone might choose to risk their life to save that of a complete stranger. The goal of this book is to help you learn to think about social behaviors in the same way that social psychologists do. We believe you will find this approach useful because it will allow you to think about human behavior more critically and more objectively and to gain insight into your own relationships with other people. Social psychologists study everyday behavior scientifically, and their research creates a useful body of knowledge about our everyday social interactions. “ Raoul Wallenberg.

      "The field of social psychology is growing rapidly and is having an increasingly important influence on how we think about human behavior. Newspapers, magazines, websites, and other media frequently report the findings of social psychologists, and the results of social psychological research are influencing decisions in a wide variety of areas. Let’s begin with a short history of the field of social psychology and then turn to a review of the basic principles of the science of social psychology. The History of Social Psychology The science of social psychology began when scientists first started to systematically and formally measure the thoughts, feelings, and behaviors of human beings (Kruglanski &amp; Stroebe, 2011). The earliest social psychology experiments on group behavior were conducted before 1900 (Triplett, 1898), and the first social psychology textbooks were published in 1908 (McDougall, 1908/2003; Ross, 1908/1974). During the 1940s and 1950s, the social psychologists Kurt L\n",

      "Social psychologists are not the only people interested in understanding and predicting social behavior or the only people who study it. Social behavior is also considered by religious leaders, philosophers, politicians, novelists, and others, and it is a common topic on TV shows. But the social psychological approach to understanding social behavior goes beyond the mere observation of human actions. Social psychologists believe that a true understanding of the causes of social behavior can only be obtained through a systematic scientific approach, and that is why they conduct scientific research. Social psychologists believe that the study of social behavior should be empirical —that is, based on the collection and systematic analysis of observable data . The Importance of Scientific Research Because social psychology concerns the relationships among people, and because we can frequently find answers to questions about human behavior by using our own common sense or intuition, many pe\n",
      "othesis. The goal of correlational research is to search for and test hypotheses about the relationships between two or more variables. In these studies, a statistic known as the Pearson correlation coefficient is used to summarize the association, or correlation, between the variables. Because scientists are interested in determining the causal relationships among variables, they frequently use experimental research designs. In experiments, the variables of interest are called the independent variable and the dependent variable. The most common method of creating equivalence among the experimental conditions, and thus increasing internal validity, is through random assignment to conditions. External validity refers to the extent to which relationships can be expected to hold up when they are tested again in different ways and for different people. Meta-analyses can be used to assess the observed relationships among variables across many studies. II Chapter 2. Social Cognition Chapter \n",

      "Strategic Management: A Prickly Problem for Blackberry® How did the once-dominant smartphone maker BlackBerry get crushed by Apple, Samsung, and other competitors in the mobile marketplace? Formerly known as Research In Motion, BlackBerry once was the unquestioned leader in smartphones, at a time when email was the Internet’s killer app and its devices provided an excellent way to stay on top of it. BlackBerry was fully committed to hard keyboards, while Apple sought to be rid of them. At first glance, it’s obvious that BlackBerry was too wedded to its keyboard-based devices, while new designs and technologies cut into its business. Looking deeper, one could pin some blame on the Canadian firm’s dual-CEO leadership structure, as well as its inordinate focus on corporate customers. Its bid to recapture market share [in 2013] with the touch-screen Z10 and hard-keyboard Q10 fell far short. BlackBerry investors over the previous five years had seen more than 90 percent of shareholder value\n",
      "e rolled into town, followed by Android devices, BlackBerry was struggling to compete, and simply didn’t innovate quickly enough to keep its loyal following. The BlackBerry brand already has been pressed to near extinction by competitors, including the Apple iPhone and Google Android OS smartphones, led by Samsung products. Apple’s iPhone had about half of BlackBerry’s market share in 2008, and Google Android was in its infancy. By the end of 2011, BlackBerry had less than 9 percent market share, Apple had almost 24 percent, and Android OS phones dominated with more than 50 percent. The Z10 was hardly the start of the downfall of the BlackBerry brand, but it may be part of the final chapter (Lazarus, 2013; Martin, 2013). References Lazarus, A. (2013, September 24).

      "2 Frameworks and Approaches to Community What is an open working group? Open working groups are a great way to conduct advocacy and build momentum for open education in an institution. They bring together the people on campus that are interested in or already engaged in open educational practices (OEP). These groups are oriented towards particular tasks for a certain length of time. Some may revolve around a project like developing a Zed Cred or an Open Educational Resource (OER) strategy, and others may include cross-functional members in charge of distributing OER grants. The term “working group” is often used to distinguish a group from something more formal, such as a committee or steering group. Many institutions purposefully choose the term “working group” to signify ideological driven action, with members working in partnership towards a common goal. You may choose to name your group something even less formal—perhaps, “[School Name]’s Open Champions,” or more formal like, “Open\n",
      "onclusion Now that you have completed this section, go through the checklist below to guide you through the process of establishing a new open working group or use it to revisit how your current open working group is set up. Checklist: Establish an Open Working Group Establish a framework/approach for your open working group. Consider the fit for your institution. What sort of group can be the most effective? Formal or informal? Determine who are the open advocates or supporters at your institution and ways of engaging them in the open working group. List the relevant stakeholders and how you will engage them. Establish the open working group’s goals and purpose. Find ways that open education links with your institution’s strategic plan or vision. Identify potential funding options for open education at your institution.

      "11 Key Considerations Regardless of where your open working group may fall on the spectrum of formal to informal, there are certain things to consider doing and places you can look for support. Keep a record Kick off your committee by establishing a shared digital place where agendas, minutes, best practices, and other documents can reside. Avoid documents becoming orphaned in individual emails. Inventory the different ways to communicate with your community at your institution and establish when, how, and what you will communicate out from your group. One approach that has been taken by a number of open working groups is to consider an open way to document and keep a record. At the University of British Columbia, the UBC Wiki (MediaWiki) is used for sharing all agendas, activities, and members in the open. You may want to look at the Open Ed Tech Collaborative apps available via Sandstorm for collaborative editing tools that will allow you to share and edit documents. Find administrat\n",

Consider some of the following documents: the strategic plan and vision tenure promotion documents collective agreements Develop a plan for openly licensing and sharing the resources that you create within the open working group. How will you license, share, and make these resources accessible? Work together to design an open education workshop. List individuals and roles that you would like to celebrate and highlight at your institution. Make a list of resources that your institution currently has that support open education. Then go through the examples of open resources at different institutions. Look for gaps. What resources can your group develop or adapt to support open at your institution?

      "19 Sustain Sustainability in relation to OER is closely linked to the business model or approach that an individual, group or institution adopts to release, manage and support OER. It is not just about sustaining existing OER but about embedding processes and transforming practices to support ongoing OER production and release. The sustainability of your open working group is very much related to the sustainability of open education and the open educational resources (OER) that are used, created, and adapted at your institution. Sustaining OER is often done at the open working group level, and the practice of sustaining OER can strengthen the open working group. Koohang and Harman argue that because communities of practice (CoPs) are “characteristically decentralized,” they can improve the scalability of open projects. This is because the decentralized nature of CoPs allows for “members [with] different skills and experiences” to work together towards the “common goal” of sustaining OE\n",

      "Working in the hospitality industry takes a certain kind of individual. The industry itself can be very rewarding and a lot of fun, but it also requires people who like to work with other people, enjoy a fast-paced environment, and enjoy a lot of variety in their routine, as things often change from day to day and week to week. Not all jobs in the industry require the same skills, so it is important for those who are interested in a career, either in the front or back of the house, to understand their own skills and interests, and then use that information to find the right “fit” when it comes to a job. If you don’t enjoy talking to new people and being outgoing, then likely a career in the front of the house isn’t for you. However, if you are creative, enjoy working with your hands, and find working as a team rewarding, then you might be the perfect candidate for a position in the kitchen. 2 Industry Expectations The hospitality and food service industry has a longstanding tradition o\n",

      "There are many careers in the food service industry for talented and well-trained individuals. Opportunities in this industry have been steadily increasing for the last several decades and the demand for skilled people, at times, has exceeded the number of suitable applicants. Currently, there is expected to be higher demand for jobs than there are available people to work, and shortages in the tourism and hospitality industry could be as high as 15,000 people by 2020 (go2HR, 2012). Occupations in the industry generally fall into three categories: front of house; back of house, and administrative. Front of house occupations include those responsible for serving the food and the customers, such as waiters, hosts/hostesses, and bussers. Back of house occupations include those responsible for preparing the food, including cooks, chefs , and dishwashers.

      "In a post-secondary environment, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time. The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject.

Doing so helps you make a positive impression and get a quicker response. Key Takeaways Post-secondary-level reading and writing assignments differ from high school assignments, not only in quantity but also in quality. Managing reading assignments successfully requires you to plan and manage your time, set a purpose for reading, practise effective comprehension strategies, and use active reading strategies to deepen your understanding of the text. Post-secondary writing assignments place greater emphasis on learning to think critically about a particular discipline and less emphasis on personal and creative writing. 1.2 Developing Study Skills \n",
