Ans: B 
9. (2 p) Answer the following questions that relate to bonds. 
-A 2-year zero- coupon bond is selling for $890.00. What is the yield to maturity of this 
bond? 
3
-The pri ce of a 1 -year zero coupon bond is $931.97. What is the yield to maturity of this 
bond? 
-Calculate the forward rate for the second year. 
-How can you construct a synthetic one -year forward loan  of $ 1’000 (you are agreeing 
now to loan in one year)? State the strategy and show the corresponding cash flows. 
Assume that you can purchase and sell fractional portions of bonds. Show all calculations 
and discuss the meaning of the transactions. 
Ans: Calculations are shown in the table below. 
-Calcula tions for YTM of the 2- year zero: N=2, PV= -890.00, PMT=0, FV=1000, i2=6.0. 
-Calculations for YTM of the 1- year zero: N=1, PV= -931.97, PMT=0, FV=1000, i1=7.3. 
-Calculations for f 2 : (1.06)2/(1.073) – 1 = .047157502, f2 = 4.7157502% 
-As shown by the ca lculations below, you purchase enough 2 -year zeros to offset the cost 
of the 1- year zero. At time 1 the 1- year zero matures and you get $1,000. At time 2 the 2-
year zeros mature and you have to pay 1.047157502 * $1,000 = $1,047.16. You are 
effectively borrowing $1,000 a year from now and paying $1,047.16 a year from then. The 
rate on this forward loan is $1,047.16/$1,000 – 1 = .04716, which equals the forward rate 
for the second year (f 2). 
Strategy Cash Flow
Buy a 1- year zero- coupon bond -$931.97
Sell 1.047157502 2-year zeros $890.00 * 1.047157502 = $931.97
Net Cash Flow $0.00

B) 5.84% 
C) 19.60% 
D) 24.17% 
E) 26.0% 
Ans: E 
21. (1 p) Discuss marking to market and margin accounts in the futures market. 
7
Ans: When opening an account, the trader establishes a margin account. The margin 
deposit may be cash or near cash, such as T -bills. Both sides of the contract must post 
margin. The initial margin is between 5 and 15% of the total value of the contract. The 
more volatile the asset, the higher the margin requirement. The clearingho use recognizes 
profits and losses at the end of each trading day; this daily settlement is marking to market, 
thus proceeds accrue to the trader's account immediately; maturity date does not govern the 
realization of profits or losses. 
22. (1.5 p) In an increasingly globalized investment environment, comparability problems 
become even greater. Discuss some of the problems for the investor who wishes to have an 
internationally diversified portfolio. 
Ans: Firms in other countries are not required to prepare financial statement according to 
U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. Accounting practices in other countries 
vary from those of the U. S. In some countries, accounting standards may be very lax or 
virtually nonexistent. Some of the maj or differences are: reserve practices, many countries 
allow more discretion in setting aside reserves for future contingencies than is typical in the 
U. S.; depreciation practices, in the U. S., firms often use accelerated depreciation for tax 
purposes, a nd straight line depreciation for accounting purposes, while most other countries 
do not allow such dual accounts, and finally, the treatment of intangibles varies considerably across countries. 
Finally, the problem of obtaining financial information may be considerable for some 
international investments, varying currency exchange rates present additional 
complications, translation of statements into English is another complication; potential 
government expropriation of assets and political unrest may be p roblems in some countries. 
In general, for the individual investor, investing in global or international mutual funds is a less risky way to add diversification to the portfolio than is attempting to value individual international securities. 
23. (1 p) Discuss rate anticipation swaps as a bond portfolio management strategy. 
Ans: Rate anticipation swap is an active bond portfolio management strategy, based on 
predicting future interest rates. If a portfolio manager believes that interest rates will 
decline, the manager will swap into bonds of greater duration. Conversely, if the portfolio 
manager believes that interest rates will increase, the portfolio manager will swap into bonds of shorter duration. This strategy is an active one, resulting in hi gh transactions 
costs, and the success of this strategy is predicated on the bond portfolio manager's ability 
to predict correctly interest rate changes consistently over time (a difficult task, indeed). 
24. (1.5 p) Discuss contingent immunization. Is this form of bond portfolio management 
strategy an active, passive, or combination of both, strategy? 
8
Ans: Contingent immunization is portfolio management technique where the portfolio 
owner is willing to accept an average annual return over a period of  time that is lower than 
that currently available. The portfolio manager may actively manage the portfolio until (if) 
the portfolio declines in value to the point that the portfolio must be immunized in order to 
earn the minimum average required return. Thus, the portfolio will be immunized 
contingent upon reaching that level. If that level is not reached, the portfolio will not be 
immunized, and the average annual returns will be greater than those required. Thus, this 
strategy is considered to be a co mbination active/passive bond portfolio management 
strategy. 
25. (1.5 p) Although the expectations of increases in future interest rates can result in an 
upward sloping yield curve; an upward sloping yield curve does not in and of itself imply the expectations of higher future interest rates. Explain. 
Ans: The effects of possible liquidity premiums confound any simple attempt to extract 
expectation from the term structure. That is, the upward sloping yield curve may be due to 
expectations of interes t rate increases, or due to the requirement of a liquidity premium, or 
both. The liquidity premium could more than offset expectations of decreased interest 
rates, and an upward sloping yield would result. 
26. (1.5 p) Discuss the three theories of the t erm structure of interest rates. Include in your 
discussion the differences in the theories, and the advantages/disadvantages of each. 
Ans: The expectations hypothesis is the most commonly accepted theory of term structure. 
The theory states that the forward rate equals the market consensus expectation of future 
short- term rates. Thus, yield to maturity is determined solely by current and expected 
future one -period interest rates. An upward sloping, or normal, yield curve would indicate 
that investors anticipate an increase in interest rates. An inverted, or downward sloping, 
yield curve would indicate an expectation of decreased interest rates. A horizontal yield 
curve would indicate an expectation of no interest rate changes. 
The liquidity pref erence theory of term structure maintains that short -term investors
dominate the market; thus, in general, the forward rate exceeds the expected short -term 
rate. In other words, investors prefer to be liquid to illiquid, all else equal, and will demand 
a liquidity premium in order to go long term. Thus, liquidity preference readily explains 
the upward sloping, or normal, yield curve. However, liquidity preference does not readily 
explain other yield curve shapes.
Market segmentation and preferred habitat theories indicate that the markets for different 
maturity debt instruments are segmented. Market segmentation maintains that the rates for 
the different maturities are determined by the intersection of the supply and demand curves 
for the different matu rity instruments. Market segmentation readily explains all shapes of 
yield curves. However, market segmentation is not observed in the real world. Investors 
and issuers will leave their preferred maturity habitats if yields are attractive enough on 
other maturities.

27. (2 p) Discuss the M2 measure of performance by answering the following questions. Why 
is M2 better than the Sharpe measure? What measure of risk does M2 use? How do you 
construct a managed portfolio, P, to use in computing the M2 mea sure? What is the 
formula for M2 ? Draw a graph that shows how M2 would be measured. Be sure to label 
the axes and all relevant points. 
Ans: The Sharpe measure indicates whether a portfolio underperformed the market index, 
but the difference between the market's Sharpe measure and the portfolio's Sharpe measure 
is difficult to interpret. M2 uses the same measure of risk as the Sharpe measure – 
variation in total return, calculated as the standard deviation. For managed portfolio P an 
adjusted portfo lio P* is formed by combining P with borrowing or lending at the risk- free 
rate to the point where P* has the same volatility as a market index (M). Then since M and 
P have the same standard deviation they can be directly compared using the M2 measure. 
M2 = rP* -rM. If P* outperforms M the measure will be positive, which means the CAL 
on which P* lies will have a steeper slope than the CML on which M lies. M2 is the distance between the CAL and the CML. The graph should look like the one in Figure 24.2 on page 814. 
28. (1.5 p) Discuss some of the factors that might be included in a multifactor model of security returns in an international application of arbitrage pricing theory (APT). 
Ans: Some of the factors that might be considered in a multifac tor international APT
model are:
(A) A world stock index
(B) A national (domestic) stock index
(C) Industrial/sector indexes
(D) Currency movements.
Studies have indicated that domestic factors appear to be the dominant influence on stock 
returns. However, there is clear evidence of a world market factor during the market crash 
of October 1987.
29. (1.5 p) Why are many bonds callable? What is the disadvantage to the investor of a 
callable bond? What does the investor receive in exchange for a bond  being callable? 
How are bond valuation calculations affected if bonds are callable? 
Ans: Many bonds are callable to give the issuer the option of calling the bond in and 
refunding (reissuing) the bond if interest rates decline. Bonds issued in a hig h interest rate 
environment will have the call feature. Interest rates must decline enough to offset the cost 
of floating a new issue. The disadvantage to the investor is that the investor will not 
receive that long stream of constant income that the bon dholder would have received with a 
noncallable bond. In return, the yields on callable bonds are usually slightly higher than 
10
the yields on noncallable bonds of equivalent risk. When the bond is called, the investor 
receives the call price (an amount greater than par value). The bond valuation calculation 
should include the call price rather than the par value as the final amount received; also, 
only the cash flows until the first call should be discounted. The result is that the investor 
should be look ing at yield to first call, not yield to maturity, for callable bonds. 
30. (1.5 p) Discuss some of the accounting comparability problems involved in international 
investing. 
Ans: Some of the major accounting comparability problems in international i nvesting are:
(A) Depreciation. The U. S. allows firms to use different depreciation methods for 
financial reporting and tax purposes. The use of dual statements is uncommon in other 
countries.
(B) Reserves. U. S. standards generally allow lower discretionary reserves for possible 
losses, resulting in higher reported earnings than other countries.
(C) Consolidation. Accounting practices in some countries do not call for all subsidiaries 
to be consolidated in the corporation's income statement.
(D) T axes. Taxes may be reported as either paid or accrued.
(E) P/E ratios. There may different practices for calculating the number of shares used to 
calculate the P/E ratios. For example, firms may use end -of-year shares, year- average 
shares, or beginning- of-year shares.
31. (1.5 p) Discuss performance evaluation of international portfolio managers in terms of potential sources of abnormal returns. 
Ans: The following factors may be measured to determine the performance of an 
international portfolio m anager.
(A) Currency selection: a benchmark might be the weighted average of the currency 
appreciation of the currencies represented in the EAFE portfolio.
(B) Country selection measures the contribution to performance attributable to investing in 
the better -performing stock markets of the world. Country selection can be measured as 
the weighted average of the equity index returns of each country using as weights the share 
of the manager's portfolio in each country.
(C) Stock selection ability may be me asured as the weighted average of equity returns in 
excess of the equity index in each country. 
(D) Cash/bond selection may be measured as the excess return derived from weighting 
bonds and bills differently from some benchmark weights. 
32. (2 p) Aunt G unda holds her portfolio 100% in U.S. securities. She tells you that she 
believes foreign investing can be extremely hazardous to her portfolio. She's not sure 
about the details, but has “heard some things”. Discuss this idea with Aunt Gunda by 
11
listing three objections you have heard from your clients who have similar fears. Explain 
each of the objections is subject to faulty reasoning. 
Ans: A few of the factors students may mention are 
-Client: “The U.S. markets have done extremely well in the pa st few years, so I should 
stay 100% invested in them.” Your Reply: You can explain that there are other times when 
foreign markets have beat the U.S. substantially in performance. You can't tell easily 
beforehand what markets will do the best. It is important to consider that there are many 
times when countries' markets move in different directions and you can buffer your risk to 
some extent by investing globally. 
-Client: “You should keep your money at home.” Your Reply: Don't confuse familiarity 
with good portfolio management. Even though there is a lot of information available on 
U.S. companies, it can be difficult to use the information to make good forecasts. Most 
professional managers aren't even good at this. 
-Client: “There's too much curre ncy risk.” Your Reply: It is true that there may be times 
when both a security's value in its own currency and the currency exchange rate may lead to poor returns. But the opposite is also true. And there are cases when security price 
movements and curr ency movements will have opposite impacts on your portfolio's return. 
This may have a smoothing effect on your portfolio. 
-Client: “Invest with the best.” Your Reply: Even if U.S. markets have been the best 
performers in recent periods there is no guar antee that things will stay that way. If you 
diversify internationally you will benefit when other markets take the lead. 
33. (1.5 p) Define and discuss the Sharpe, Treynor, and Jensen measures of portfolio 
performance evaluation, and the situations in which each measure is the most appropriate 
measure. 
Ans: Sharpe's measure, (rP -rf)/sP, is a relative measure of the average portfolio return in 
excess of the average risk- free return over a period time per unit of risk, as measured by the 
standard de viation of the returns of the portfolio over that time period.
Treynor's measure, (rP -rf)/bP, is a relative measure of the average portfolio return in 
excess of the average risk- free return over a period of time per unit of risk, as measured by 
the beta of the portfolio over that time period.
Jensen's measure, aP = rP -[rf + bP(rM -rf)], is a measure of absolute return (average 
return on the portfolio over a period of time) over and above that predicted by the CAPM. 
As the risk measure in the Sha rpe measure of portfolio performance evaluation is total risk, 
this measure is appropriate for portfolio performance evaluation if the portfolio being 
evaluated represents the investor's complete portfolio of assets. 
As the risk measure in the Treynor measure of portfolio performance evaluation is beta, or 
systematic risk, this measure is the appropriate portfolio performance evaluation measure if 
the portfolio being evaluated is only a small part of a large investment portfolio. This 
12
measure is also a ppropriate for evaluation of managers of ""subportfolios"" of large funds, 
such as large pension plans. 
As the Jensen measure, or Jensen's alpha, measures the return of a portfolio relative to that 
predicted by the CAPM, this measure is appropriate for t he evaluation of managers of 
""subportfolios"" of large funds. However, the Treynor measure is an even better measure 
for such a scenario. 
34. (1 p) Explain why mean -variance analysis is inadequate for valuing market timing. 
Ans: The mean -variance approach relies on those two statistics to determine whether a 
portfolio earned an appropriate return relative to other portfolios. But when dealing with a 
perfect market timer the standard deviation is not relevant. The perfect timer will move in 
and out of the market as appropriate to earn the most favorable rate of return. Even when 
the market is riskier, as measured by standard deviation, it will be appropriate to be in the market if the returns are suitable. The other factor that is involved is skewne ss. A perfect 
market timer works with portfolios that are not normally distributed, but are skewed to the 
right. The skewness parameter is not incorporated into mean -variance analysis. 
35. (1 p) What is an Exchange -traded fund? Give two examples of specific ETFs. What are 
some advantages they have over ordinary open -end mutual funds? What are some 
disadvantages? 
Ans: ETFs allow investors to trade index portfolios. Some examples are spiders (SPDR), 
which track the S&P500 index, diamonds (DIA), which track the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and qubes (QQQ), which track the Nasdaq 100 index. Other examples are listed 
in Table 4 -3, page 117. (It is anticipated that there may soon be ETFs that track actively 
managed funds as well ad the current ones that track indexes.) 
Advantages -
1. ETFs may be bought and sold during the trading day at prices that reflect the current value of the underlying index. This is different from ordinary open -end mutual funds, 
which are bought or sold only at the end of  the day NAV. 
2. ETFs can be sold short. 
3. ETFs can be purchased on margin. 
4. ETFs may have tax advantages. Managers are not forced to sell securities from a 
portfolio to meet redemption demands, as they would be with open -end funds. Small 
investo rs simply sell their ETF shares to other traders without affecting the composition of 
the underlying portfolio. Institutional investors who want to sell their shares receive shares 
of stock in the underlying portfolio. 
5. ETFs may be cheaper to buy than mutual funds because they are purchased from 
brokers. The fund doesn't have to incur the costs of marketing itself, so the investor incurs 
lower management fees. 
13
Disadvantages -
1. ETF prices can differ from NAV by small amounts because of the way they  trade. This 
can lead to arbitrage opportunities for large traders. 
2. ETFs must be purchased from brokers for a fee. This makes them more expensive than 
mutual funds that can be purchased at NAV.

either organic or inorganic carbon as their carbon source: 
NH4+ → NO2-→ NO3– (uses inorganic carbon) 
while others catalyze their reduction:
NO3– → NO2-→ N2O → N2 (uses organic carbon)
(i)	(2 Points) What are each of these processes called? 
Nitrification (oxidation) carried out by nitrifying bacteria
Denitrification (reduction) carried out by denitrifying bacteria
(ii)	(2 Points) What is the “metabolic classification” of organisms that carry each of these 
processes out? List the carbon source and the redox transformation of carbon for each 
of the processes. 
nitrifying bacteria: chemosynthetic bacteria (aerobic autotrophs) oxidize ammonium and 
reduce CO2. 
denitrifying bacteria: anaerobic respiration (heterotrophs) reduce nitrate and oxidize 
organic carbon 
(iii) (5 Points) How can each group of microbes “make a living” by doing essentially opposite 
things ? That is, how does each process benefit the organism that catalyzes it? 
Nitrifying bacteria use energy from the oxidation of nitrogen compounds to reduce CO2 
to organic carbon, which they then use as their carbon source. Denitrifying bacteria get 
their energy and carbon from the organic compounds produced by autotrophs. They 
oxidize organic compounds to CO2 for energy, using NO3-or NO2-as a final electron 
acceptor. 
2. Answer the following questions “True” or “False” (1 Point Each). 
___F___ The limiting factor for productivity in an ecosystem is always the element that is in 
lowest concentration.
___T___ Net community production of an ecosystem can never be greater than net primary
production.
____F__ N-limited lakes will often be very clear because nothing can grow in them since they 
are so nutrient poor. 
____F__ Chlorophyll concentrations are maximal at the surface of the ocean where light
intensity is greatest.
___T___ The amount of gross primary production in a forest is equal to the amount of carbon 
from CO2 fixed by photosynthesis of plants and bacteria in the forest. Name: ____________________ Page 2 
3. (14 Points) D. J. Des Marais diagrammed the history of the Earth as a clock in units of 
billions of years ago (b.y.a.) (Science 289: 1703(2000)). A simplified version of this clock is 
reproduced below. The following questions refer to parts of the graph labeled with letters. 
(i) (1 Point) What appeared on Earth at “A”? 
Life 
(ii) (2 Points) What atmospheric event occurred at “B”? How did it affect life at that time? 
The Great Oxygenation Event. Oxygen was toxic to many life forms, so they had to 
adapt. 
(iii) (2 Points) Describe the Earth’s atmosphere at the highlighted region “C”. What major 
gases were present? 
The Earth’s atmosphere was reducing. Methane, carbon dioxide, reduced forms of 
nitrogen, etc., were present. Oxygen was absent. 
(iv) (3 Points) Describe the Earth’s atmosphere at “D”. What factors led to the differences 
between the Earth’s atmosphere between “C” and “D”? 
The Earth’s atmosphere was similar to today’s with ~21% oxygen. The differences were 
caused by the “great oxygenation event” and the emergence of photosynthesis. 
(v) (1 Point) Draw, based on this approximate scale, when on this “clock” humans appeared 
on Earth. 
(vi) (5 Points) Your friend, a geologist, wants your help investigating an ancient rock with 
curious banding and circular patterns. He has already demonstrated that the banding is 
not iron. What point on this graph represents the time the rock might be from? How 
would you test the origins of the patterning? What results would prove your hypothesis? 
The rock might be from Point A, the origins of life. The banding could represent an 
ancient stromatolite fossil. You could test the biological origins of life by looking at stable 
isotope fractionation. Specifically, you could look at δ13C: if the ratio was lower than 
expected (i.e. the material is isotopically “lighter”), the material is probably of biological 
origin. Name: ____________________ Page 3 
4. (11 Points) The graphs below describe the physical structure of two temperate lake 
ecosystems. I0=incident light intensity on the water surface. 
Temperature Log I0 
1% I0 Depth Temperature Log I0 
1% I0Depth A B 
(i)	(1 Point) Label zc, the compensation depth. 
(ii)	(2 Points) Based on this information, which lake would you expect to produce the most 
phytoplankton and why? 
Lake A would have the most phytoplankton because the cells never mix below the 
compensation depth, and thus photosynthesis is always greater than respiration. 
(iii) (3 Points) Sketch on each of the graphs how you might expect the dissolved oxygen 
concentration to vary with depth, and why?. 
It would be even in the mixed layer, and decrease below that. Probably more in the 
most productive lake, but you are going to have to be liberal in how you grade this. 
(iv) (5 Points) Were these profiles measured in the summer or winter? Why? How would 
they differ if they had been measured six months earlier? (It may help you to diagram 
your response.) 
The profiles were measured in the summer because a thermocline is evident. 
Thermoclines are thermal stratifications caused by warming of surface waters due to the 
absorption of sunlight. If the profiles were measured in the winter, light attenuation 
would be the same, but the thermal profile would be a straight line. Name: ____________________ Page 4 
5.	(10 Points) In your readings, Morton wrote: “All over the world, by day and night, animals and 
bacteria and fungi and the plants themselves are using the oxygen which photosynthesis 
spits out into the atmosphere to turn organic material back into carbon dioxide and water. In 
so doing, they regenerate the energy the plants stored away. The two processes come close 
to canceling each other out. Today, though, things are out of balance. Today is a spring 
day...” 
(i)	(2 Points) Complete this thought with three sentences or more of your own to explain what 
is “out of balance”. 
In spring, plants are growing, so plants must photosynthesize more than they respire in 
order to make biomass. There is a draw down in CO2 from the atmosphere as 
photosynthesis fixes more carbon from the atmosphere than respiration respires. This 
means that the whole cumminity is adding carbon (energy) in the spring, and the NCP will 
be positive. 
(ii) (2 Points) What are the animals, bacteria and fungi “using the oxygen” for? 
They are using oxygen as a terminal electron acceptor to oxidize organic carbon to use it 
as energy 
(iii) (2 Points) If the two processes Morton describes do “cancel each other out”, can NPP still 
be positive? Justify your answer. 
Yes. NPP is GPP-Ra. This term could still be positive (the plants themselves could keep 
growing), even if the overall NCP is zero because of the respiration of heterotrophs. 
(iv) (2 Points) Over Earth’s history, have these processes always canceled each other out? 
Explain your answer. 
No. The oxygenation of the Earth’s atmosphere occurred because the process of 
photosynthesis far outstripped the process of respiration on the global scale leading to an 
increase in oxygen in the atmosphere and leading to organic carbon being stored below 
ground in the form of “ancient photosynthetically fixed carbon” 
(v)	(2 Points) Morton talks about “Eating the Sun.” Explain what he means by this. 
He means that photosynthesis uses light energy to convert CO2 into reduced organic 
carbon compounds (sugars) which are either used by the plants own respiration or used 
as the energy source in heterotrophic respiration, including our own. This means that the 
energy used for the life of heterotrophs originally came in the form of light from the Sun. Name: ____________________ Page 5 
6. (17 Points) Inspired by Priestley’s experiment involving a mouse, a plant, and a glass jar, you 
decide to build a self-sustaining closed system containing goldfish and aquatic plants. 
(i) 	(3 Points) What roles do the plants and fish play in your mini-ecosystem? How do they 
depend on one another? 
The plants are the primary producers (autotrophs) , fixing CO2 and releasing oxygen. 
The fish are the Heterotrophs, consuming O2 to break down the products of the plants. 
The two organisms complement each other by cycling carbon and oxygen back and forth 
between them. 
(ii) 	(6 Points) Before you seal off the system, you decide to do some tests to make sure your 
system will be balanced, i.e. the mix of fish and plants is adequate. You do this by 
temporarily placing the different components of your system int o sealed containers and 
measuring the O2 concentration for three hours in the light and three hours in darkness. 
On the axes below, sketch 3 graphs of the change in O2 over time that you expect to see 
for the aquatic plants alone, the goldfish alone, and the aquatic plants and goldfish 
combined. Assume you are using sterile water. O2 Concentration
(pg O2 L-1) 
Light Dark
Time (hours)
(iii) (6 Points) Explain the features of your graphs . 
(iv) (2 Points) You decide you are ready to assemble the final system, but you are very tired 
from all of your problem sets and accidentally fill the container with water from the 
Charles River and leave it in the dark overnight. The next day, though your plant looks 
healthy, your fish is floating upside down. You know the water does not have 
anthropogenic toxins in it, because you just read a water quality report from the MDC. 
What do you hypothesize as the cause of death of the fish and why? 
The Charles River water had a lot of organic matter and microbes decomposing it. The 
microbes used up all the oxygen and the fish suffocated. Name: ____________________ Page 6 
7. (16 Points) You are a limnologist studying several lakes in northern Ontario. The lakes have 
little input of nutrients from streams. You measure the concentrations of nitrate and 
phos phate every two months, and generate the following data. All units are in µg/L 
concentration. Using the graph paper provided below may help you answer the question.

(i) (6 Points) Which lake is limited by the availability of P? By the availability of N? Explain 
your answer. 
P-limited: Trout Lake – because the intercept is on the y axis… indicating that when P 
runs out, there is still N in the lake. 
N-limited: Big Lake – because the intercept is the P axis 
The Redfield Ratio for N:P is 16:1. Whenever the ratio exceeds 16 (as in Trout Lake), 
phos phorous is limiting. When the ratio is less than 16, nitrogen is limiting. 
(ii) (4 Points) In which lake do you expect more blue-green algae (cyanobacteria)? Why? 
More cyanobacteria would be present in Big Lake because it is N-limited. Cyanobacteria 
are capable of fixing nitrogen, so they would have a competitive advantage over other 
algae in a nitrogen-limited system. (See in-class example of Lake Washington). 
(iii) (3 Points) A resort-house development is proposed to be built around Lake Balance 
leading to the use of large numbers of septic systems around the lake. (Septic systems 
leach nitrogenous compounds into the groundwater, and the groundwater ultimately 
carries them to the lake). Would Lake Balance start to look more like Trout Lake or Big 
Lake over time? 
Lake Balance would start to look more like Trout Lake because Trout Lake is P-limited. 
The septic systems are leaching nitrogen-bearing compounds into the water, making 
Lake Balance enriched in nitrogen with respect to phos phorous. 
(iv) (3 Points) The development goes ahead, and the concentrations of NO3 in Lake Balance 
skyrocket. At the same time, the housing developments around the lake began to leach 
sewage into the lake, increasing its P supply. What might happen to the oxygen 
concentrations in the deep waters of Lake Balance over time and why? What is this 
process called? 
Oxygen concentrations will decline, especially in the deep waters of the lake. The added 
nutrients cause blooms of algae, which increase the primary productivity of the lake. 
When the algae die, they sink towards the bottom and are decomposed by heterotrophs, 
which consume oxygen as they decompose the organic carbon produced by the algae. 
This is Cultural Eutrophication, 
Bonus (1 Point): To mitigate the effects of the added nitrate from sewage coming from the 
new homes surrounding Lake Balance, the local wastewater treatment authority proposes 
an innovative solution. Rather than trying to install a sewer system ac ross the entire, 
remote area, they propose using denitrifying bacteria to convert the nitrate in groundwater 
to nitrogen gas. They set up an anaerobic ground system a nd test it. Initially they find 
that there are fast rates of denitrification, but these rates soon slow down. There is still a 
lot of nitrate to be reduced and the environment is still anaerobic. What would you 
recommend adding to the system to help spur further denitrification?

8. (8 Points) Given the following data from an Experimental Forest, answer the following 
ques tions. Show your work and units. 
Total vegetative biomass 80,000 kcal m-2 
Detritus and organic matter in soil 120,000 kcal m-2 
Total Gross Primary Productivity 20,000 kcal m-2 yr -1 
Total Plant Respiration 5,000 kcal m-2 yr -1 
Total Community Respiration 9,000 kcal m-2yr -1 
(i) (2 Points) What is the net primary productivity of the forest? 
NPP = GPP – RA = 20,000 – 5,000 = 15,000 kcal m-2 yr -1 
(ii) (2 Points) What is the net community production? 
NCP = GPP – RA – RH = 20,000 – 9000 = 11,000 kcal m-2 yr -1 
(iii) (2 Points) What is the mean residenc e time of carbon in the vegetative biomass? 
MRT = biomass / NPP = 80,000/15,000 = 5.3 years 
(iv) (2 Points) Is this a fully mature forest? Explain your answer. 
no. NCP > 0 
9. (8 Points) You are a microbe and you go to the store where they are having a sale on 
elemental sulfur. You are thinking about buying some elemental sulfur to consume to make 
energy. There’s plenty of sulfur, but you need to buy something to go with it. All that’s left at 
the store besides sulfur is nitrate (NO3-) and succinate. You do have the recipe (i.e. genes) to 
convert NO3-to N2 gas and to convert S to SO42-. You also have a recipe to convert S to H2S 
and succinate to fumarate. Assume you can buy and react one mole of each in standard 
conditions. Should you buy the NO3-or the succinate if your goal is to maximize the amount 
of energy produced from one mole of sulfur? 
1) SO42-+ 8H+ +6e--> S0 + 4H2O -0.20V
2) NO3-+ 6H++ 6 e--> 1/2N2 + 3H2O +0.75V
3) fumarate+ 2 H+ +2esuccinate = +0.031V
4) S + 2 H+ +2e--> H2S -0.243 V
For the coupled sulfur oxidation and denitrification:
dE=0.75-(-0.20)= 0.95 E
dG=-8*93.67*0.95= -711.892 kj/mol
For the coupled sulfur reduction and fumarate oxidation
dE=-0.243-(0.031)= -0.274 E
dG=-2*93.67*-0.274= 51.33kJ/mol
You should buy the nitrate. Name: ____________________ Page 9 
Bonus Problem (up to 5 points): 
The Peak District Moorlands in the United Kingdom store 20 million tonnes of carbon, almost 
half of the carbon stored in the soils of the entire United Kingdom (the Moorlands are only 8% 
of the land area). In pristine condition, these peatlands can store an additional 13,000 tonnes 
of carbon per year. 
(i)	Given this rate of productivity, how long did it take for the Peatlands to sequester this 
much carbon? 
20,000,000 tonnes C / 13,000 tonnes C yr-1 = 1538 years 
(ii)	What is the effective residence time of the carbon that makes it into long-term storage in 
the peatland if no disturbance occurs? (Note: this is not a calculator problem!) 
Theoretically, infinite: the net community productivity is stored in peat indefinitely. 
(iii) The Peak District Moorlands store carbon because they are saturated with water. Based 
on your knowledge of terminal electron acceptors and their efficiencies, why would this 
inhibit/slow respiration? 
Oxygen is the best electron acceptor, but in a saturated wetland anaerobic conditions 
prevail. Therefore, organisms experience slower rates of respiration because they grow 
more slowly using “poorer” metabolic pathways. 
(iv) One prediction of climate change models is a reduction in rainfall in England. This would 
transform the Moorlands into a carbon source, emitting up to 381,000 tonnes of carbon 
per year. How many years would it take to respire all the carbon stored in the Peak 
District Moorlands? 
20,000,000 tonnes C / 381,000 tonnes C yr-1 = 52.5 years!!!! - -Name: ____________________ Page 10

1. (25 points) You are hired to develop and operate a wastewater treatment plant for a fertilizer 
company that produces an effluent high in ammonium. You are given two choices for breaking 
down ammonium:

maximize your energy yield (under standard conditions). Which process would you choose? 
Show your work. 
½ O2 +2 H+ + 2 e-H2O ΔEo’ = +0.816 V – 0.340 V = 0.476 V 
-NH4+ +2 H2O NO2 +8H++6e-ΔGo’ = -6 * 96.5 kJ V-1 mol-1 * 0.476 V = -275.6 kJ mol-1

NH4+ ½ N2 +4 H+ + 3 e-ΔGo’ = -3 * 96.5 kJ V-1 mol-1 * 1.236 V = -357.8 kJ mol-1 
d. After you turn on your wastewater treatment plant, you find that you’re not getting as much 
energy as you thought you would. Recall that your above calculations are based on standard 
conditions of 1 M for solutes and 1 atm for gases. You meas ure the NH4+ concentration and find 
that it is only 0.01 M. Using your selected process, what would you expect your energy yield (1 
atm, 298 K) to be? 
ΔGo’ = -357.8 kJ mol-1 + 0.00831 kJ K-1 mol-1 * 298 K * ln(([1]1 * [1]2) / ([0.01]1 * [1]1)) =

2. (25 points) Jonathan and Skylar are trying to recreate the Early Earth experiment of Miller and 
Urey. They decide to use some air from outside Building 48, put it in a reaction chamber and 
apply sparks. To Jonathan and Skylar’s surprise, their results don’t match up with those of Miller 
and Urey. 
a. Describe what the air that Jonathan and Skylar added to their tank was composed of (rough 
proportions of major gases). 
78% nitrogen, 21% oxygen, trace amounts of other gases. Name: ____________________ Page 3 
b. Describe which gases Miller and Urey used (i.e. the gases of the early atmosphere) and explain 
what the Miller-Urey experiment found. 
Methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), molecular hydrogen (H2), and water (H2O). By adding a spark 
(to simulate lightning), Miller and Urey created amino acids from simple organic molecules 
formed in the gas mixture (e.g. hydrogen cyanide and formaldehyde). 
c. Why was the early atmosphere more conducive to the success of this experiment? Hint: you 
should mention the properties of the gases in parts (a) and (b). 
The early atmosphere, whether that described by Miller and Urey or in different proportions, did 
not have oxygen. This lack of oxygen in the Earth’s early atmosphere prohibited the formation of 
complex molecules. The Miller-Urey model is of a “reducing” atmosphere. 
d. The “Great Oxygenation Event” is one of the most important, yet poorly understood, events in 
the Earth’s history. Scientists use various indicators in the geologic record to determine when and 
why this occurred. Please check the boxes beside the factors that may be helpful in determining 
when the oxygenation of Earth’s atmosphere occurred.

total biomass of the ecosystem. Show your work and state any assumptions made. 
MRT = Biomass/NPP 
NPP = 200,000 g C + 20,000 g C – 50,000 g C – 50,000 g C =120,000 g C 
Biomass = MRT * NPP 
Biomass = 0.15 year * 120,000 g C year-1 = 18,000 g C 
c. You want to measure the productivity of a sample of surface water from the Charles River. At 
9 am you collect two 500 mL bottles of water, one completely opaque and one clear, meas ure 
their O2 content, seal them, and leave them in the river. 8 hours later you retrieve your samples 
and measure their O2 content (total amount of O2 in the 500 mL sample). Calculate the GPP in 
g C hour-1 of your water sample. The molecular weight of C is 12 g mol-1 and O2 is 32 g mol-1. 
Time Opaque Clear 
9am 1.0 mol O2 1.0 mol O2 
5pm 0.37 mol O2 1.23 mol O2 
Gross O2 produced = |clear ΔO2| + opaque ΔO2 
6 CO2 + 12 H2O + Light C6H12O6 +6 O2 + 6 H2O 
For every 1 mole of O2 produced 1 mole of C is fixed. 
GPP = (0.23 mol O2 + 0.63 mol O2) * 1 mol C / 1 mol O2 *12 g mol-1 / 8 hours = 1.29 g C hour-1 
d. You now want to measure the productivity of the open ocean. Would you use the same 
method? If not, briefly describe the technique you would use. 
Because the productivity of a sample taken from the open ocean is so low, you could not use the 
ΔO2 technique. Even after days of incubation, there would be no discernable change in O2. 
Instead, you would use the 14C technique. This method uses radiolabeled CO2 to track the uptake 
of CO2 into organisms. By measuring the amount of 14CO2 reduced to 14C6H12O6 and 12CO 2 
available, as well as knowing the amount of 14CO2 added, the total amount of 12CO2 reduced to 
C6H12O6 can be determined. 
e. The figure below describes the change in above-ground net primary production with age for a 
stand of white spruce (Ryan et al. 1997). Explain how GPP and RA change over time by 
sketching them on the graph. Explain the trends below. Name: ____________________ Page 5 
GPP 
RA 
GPP – Gross primary productivity increas es until about year 70, and then levels off or decreases. 
At this point the forest has fully matured and photosynthesis is limited (or reduced) by some 
factor (e.g. nutrients, light, water). 
RA – RA shadows GPP as increasing photosynthesis requires more autotrophs, thus autotroph 
respiration also increases until year 70. However, after year 70 RA levels off or decreases with 
decreasing photosynthesis. Answers that describe RA as increas ing after year 70 because carbon 
stored in roots and stems require greater maintenance respiration are acceptable. 
f. Describe how Net Commu nity Production would change and why. 
NCP – Net community production will increas e until year 70, and then decline to approximately 
zero as photosynthesis (GPP) equilibrates with respiration (RA + RH). 
BONUS (2 points): According to Remmert, why is ecological theory crucial to our continued 
existence? 
“We can live on earth under the conditions now prevailing, and under no others. As a pure 
science, ecology is concerned with understanding the balance and turnover of matter and energy 
in nature. In its applied form, ecology faces the problem of discovering how the conditions 
essential for present-day life can be maintained.”

in the table below. A list of metabolic processes is provided. Some processes may be used more 
than once or not at all.

5. (15 points) Your TAs have decided to take you to the Harvard Forest instead of Plum Island for 
the class field trip. The diagram below indicates the general nitrogen cycle in this particular 
ecosystem. 
C A 
B 
a. Label what form of nitrogen or what process is occurring at: 
A B C 
Dead Organic N NH4 + (Ammo nium) Denitrification 
b. On your field trip, the TAs take you to a part of the forest where a clear-cutting experiment is 
being conducted. One of the TAs notes that the soil is losing nitrogen to surface and groundwater 
runoff. Explain why. 
Internal cycling of nitrogen is an important component of the terrestrial nitrogen budget. Plants 
are vital to this internal cycling, as they both assimilate dead organic nitrogen that has been 
mineralized to ammo nium and nitrate that has been produced from nitrite by nitrifying bacteria. 
If plants are not present to uptake and store nitrate and ammonium, they are leached from the soil. 
c. In what major ways does the nitrogen cycle differ from the phosphorous cycle? Specifically, 
compare and contrast the flow of nitrogen and phosphorous through Earth’s biosphere. 
Nitrogen is plentiful and cycles readily throughout the biosphere. Humans can create ammo nium 
from nitrogen gas using the Haber-Bosch process, and thus have an incredibly large influence on 
the nitrogen cycle. Phosphorous, in contrast, is scarce and travels on a “one-way street” from 
soils and rocks to the ocean. Humans also have a large impact on the phosphorous cycle. 
Phosphorous is mined to use in fertilizers, and while some phosphorous taken up by plants, much 
of it runs off to oceans where it is stored in relatively inacces sible marine sediments. MIT OpenCourse Ware

3. (10 points) Answer the following questions using one sentence: 
Why do cyanoba cteria bloom in lakes that are enriched with phos phorus? 
When the phos phorous limitation is removed, nitrogen often becomes limiting and some 
cyanoba cteria are able to fix nitrogen, thus giving them a competitive advantage in 
nitrogen-limited systems. 
Can a lake have a Redfield Ratio of C:N:P of 106:16:1 and still be eutrophic? How? 
Yes, adding large quantities of nitrogen and phos phorous to a lake will make it eutrophic, 
even if added at a ratio of 16:1. 
Why is the O2 minimum in oceans just below the thermocline? 
As organic compounds settle out of the mixed layer (which is equilibrated with the O2 in 
the atmosphere), they are oxidized and O2 is consumed at a rate greater than it is 
produc ed (if there is light), and these waters are isolated from the atmosphere so there is a 
net loss. 
Why is iron a limiting nutrient in some ocean ecosystems but not in lakes? 
Iron is transported to ecosystems by wind-blown dust and cycled from sediment. 
List three differences between the biogeochemistry of the clear-cut and control 
watersheds at Hubba rd Brook Experimental Forest. 
Increased surface runoff, nitrate output, leaching of cations. 
BONUS (2 points): What seminal scientific contribution did researchers at Hubba rd

forested ecosystems. 
4. (8 points) Kate and Emily are devising an evil scheme to take over the world. They
want to create a new type of super-organism that will outcompete all others.
Additionally, they want their super-organism to produc e hydrogen sulfide as a by-produc t
because it is toxic.
Kate finds two half reactions with hydrogen sulfide as a produc t: 
SO42-+ 10H+ + 8 e-H2S + 4 H20 -0.210 V 
S + 2H+ + 2e-H2S -0.243 V 
Emily wants to couple one of the above reactions with either: 
2 H+ + 2e-H2 -0.414 V 
CO2 + 4 H+ + 4e-1/6 C6H12O6 + H2O -0.430 V Name: ____________________ Page 4 
Pick which reaction is most energetically favorable (show work). 
SO42-& H2: ΔGo’ =-8F * (-0.210 + 0.414) = -1.63F 
SO42-& C6H12O6: ΔGo’= -8F * (-0.210 + 0.430) = -1.76F = -169.8 kJ V-1 mol-1 
’ S & H2: ΔGo =-2F * (-0.243 + 0.414) = -0.34F 
’ S & C6H12O6: ΔGo =-4F * (-0.243 + 0.430) = -0.75F 
5. (15 points) You have developed a pilot scale algal produc tion system designed to study 
how you might maximize the produc tion of lipids by algae for use in biofuels. You have 
learned that if you grow the cells in a nitrogen-limited chemostat, they are likely to 
produc e more lipids per cell, so you decide to set this system up. You have three 
different culture media available to you, with the following compositions: 
Concentration µg/L 
A B C 
Nitrogen 32 32 60 
Phosphorus 2 4 3 
Iron 0.05 0.04 0.005 
NOTE: In the answers below, be sure to include units. Also show your reasoning. The 
actual answer is not as important as how you arrived at it. 
a) Which medium would you use to set up your chemostat? Why? 
Medium B, N:P ratio is around 8:1 
b) You have an old broken down pump, and it can only pump media into the chemostat at 
one speed: 200 L per day. What volume of culture would you set up if you wanted your 
cells to grow at a specific growth rate, r, of 0.8 day -1? 
r = D in steady state, and D = f/V 
V=f/D 
V = 200L day-1/0.8 day-1 = 250 L 
c) At this growth rate, and with the media you selected, you find that there are 105 cells 
per L in your culture. How much nitrogen is there in each cell? 
Q = (Si – S)/N and S is negligible, so Q = Si/N 
Q = (32 µg/L)/(105 cells/L) = 3.2 x 10-4 µg/cell 
d) Your boss is not satisfied with the yield from your chemostat. How would you 
increase it? 
Increase all nutrients in Si. The system must remain nitrogen-limited. 
N = Si/Q Name: ____________________ Page 5 
e) Your boss still isn’t satisfied. She buys you a pump that actually has variable speeds. 
How would you determine the maximum pumping rate you could use to produc e the most 
amount of biomass per unit time? 
Dial up the speed and bring the culture to steady state at each incremental speed until you 
reach one that washes the cells out. The max steady state produc tion of cells would be at 
the dilution rate, D, that is right below rmax. Or determine rmax in batch culture and set the 
dilution rate right below it. 
6. (15 points) In the summer of 2010 , Skylar decides to return to Chesapeake Bay to 
participate in a study of salt marshes. In the first part of the study, S kylar is asked to 
examine the profiles of two different marine inlets of the salt marshes (shown below). Io 
is the incident light intensity at the surface of the water. 
Io IoA. B. 
ln(I) 
20 m 20 m 
ln(I) 
Temperature Temperature 
Depth Depth 
100 m 100 m 
a) Which marine site would have the most net primary produc tivity and why?
A will have the most NPP. In A, since light penetrates below the mixing depth,
phytoplankton will be actively photosynthesizing throughout the whole mixed layer and 
will have positive NPP. In B, phytoplankton will spend some of their time below the
compensation depth, so they will spend some of their time respiring only, hence their
overall NPP will be lower. In other words, the GPP/R ratio will be higher in A, meaning 
NPP will be greater. 
b) The next part of the study involves looking at the marsh itself. It is assumed in this 
problem that the only source of primary produc tivity in marshes is a marsh grass called 
Spartina. You determine that for a patch of marshland the Gross Primary Produc tivity 
(GPP) is 400 g C m-2 day-1, the NPP is 325 g C m-2 day-1, and the NCP is 200 g C m-2 
day-1. What is the respiration rate of autotrophs and heterotrophs in this system? 
NPP = GPP – RA 
NCP = NPP –RH Name: ____________________    Page 6 
Skylar participates in a survey to determine the food web of the marshland. She draws the 
following food web that includes a turtle, a snail, Spartina, a blue crab, and a striped bass:     
 
 
 
  
 
 
c) Assume the exploitation efficiency between all trophic levels is 10%.  How many g C 
of Spartina is required to produce 1200 g C of striped bass?  
P = 1200 g C/ (0.1)(0.1)(0.1) 
 
d) Define what a keystone predator is in a sentence or two.  Which of the above species is 
the keystone specie of this system?  What would happen to the other species if it were 
removed? 
A keystone predator is one that has a controlling effect on an ecosystem; its removal 
would have a larger effect than predicted by numbers alone. 
 
Blue crab, the species is keeping the periwinkle in check. Since there are no other 
competing herbivores in this system, periwinkle would eat all the Spartina, habitat would 
be gone. Striped Bass population would disappear, same with turtles.  
 
e) Skylar does some behavioral observations of striped bass in the system.  She finds that 
their diet consists of 60% blue crab and 40% of a herbivorous crab.  Calculate the striped 
bass’ exact trophic level. 
TL = 0.4*2 + 0.6*3 
 
f) List two methods taught in class to determine the mean trophic level of fish.   
Gut content analysis, stable isotope analysis 
 
g) Juncus is a species of marsh grass that is found in the high marsh (farther from the 
ocean).  It is not nearly as nitrogen and water limited as Spartina, but grows slower than 
Spartina.  How does Spartina impact Juncus’ fundamental niche?  Why does Juncus 
Name: ____________________ Page 7 
survive in the high marsh? What would happen to Juncus’ area of cover if Spartina were 
removed from the system? 
Spartina competes with Juncus for phys ical space. Because Spartina can grow fast, it 
takes up space quickly. However Juncus does not require as many nutrients and water to 
grow so its able to survive in the high marsh. If Juncus did not have to compete with 
Spartina it would be able to cover more of the marsh. 
7. (10 points) 
The size of the human popul ation on Earth has increased dramatically in the past 200 
years. This has been described as a period of “demographic transition”. Some countries 
have already finished going through the transition, while others have not. 
a) On the axes below, sketch the changes in birth rate (bx), death rate (dx), and relative 
popul ation size (N) over the course of a demographic transition in a popul ation. Indicate 
on the time axis of the graph where you might find a country like France, and where you 
might find a country like Liberia. 
Time Death Rate Birth Rate Population 
Liberia Relative 
Population Birth Rate/ Size Death Rate 
[# per 1000 
per year] 
France 
b) Explain the unde rlying causes of the features on your figure. 
When the birth and death rates are high and similar, the popu lation is fairly stable and 
relatively small. As agricultural, medicine, and technology (the ability to create/use 
energy) improve; the death rate is reduced while the birth rate stays constant. This results 
in a popul ation explosion. Decreases in death rates continue and eventually level off. 
Birth rates also decrease, reflecting socioeconom ic changes. Eventually the death rate 
surpasses the birth rate and popul ation begins to contract. 
8. (15 points) Skylar and Jonathan have had enoug h of the precipitation in New England 
and decide to go to the Kalahari Desert. They stumble across two kinds of scorpions: red 
and black. Skylar and Jonathan decide to study the competition between the two species. 
They determine that the carrying capacity (K1) of red scorpions is 100 and that the Name: ____________________    Page 8 
carrying capacity (K 2) of black scorpions is 150.  Jonathan calculates that the impact of 
the black scorpion on the red scorpion ( α) is 2 and the impact of the red scorpion on the 
black scorpion ( β) is 3. 
  
a) The initial population sizes are 25 red scorpions and 50 black scorpions.  Graph the 
isoclines for each species and plot the initial population sizes.  Predict the short-term 
dynamics of each population.  Predict the final outcome of interspecific competition. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The isoclines define an unstable equilibrium. From the initial densities, the black 
scorpions will increase and the red scorpions will decrease in the short run. Eventually, 
the red scorpions will be driven to extinction; the black scorpions will be out at their 
carrying capacity (150).  
 
b) Skylar does her own calculations and determines that Jonathan’s calculation of the 
carrying capacity (K 1) of red scorpions is wrong, but that the rest of his calculations are 
correct.  What are the relationships between carrying capacities needed for red scorpions to win in competition?  Write your answer in terms of K
1, K2, α, and β. 
K2 < K 1 β AND K 2 α  < K 1 
 
c) What are the relationships between carrying capacities needed for red scorpions to 
coexist with black scorpions?  Write your answer in terms of K 1, K 2, α, and β. 
K2 α < K 1 AND K 2 > K 1 β 
 d) Define the Intermediate Disturbance Hypothesis. 
The intermediate disturbance hypothesis states that at moderate levels of disturbance the 
biodiversity is highest, because one species is not able to totally dominate (as would in 
low disturbance) nor do all go extinct (as in high disturbance).

Jonathan and Skylar determine that according to their isoclines, red scorpions win out in 
competition. Explain to your TAs how this hypot hesis might explain why we see the red 
and black scorpions coexisting in the Kalahari Desert. 
Here, moderate disturbance may allow black scorpions to survive because it perhaps 
reduces’ the red scorpion’s popul ation often enoug h. 
9. (5 Points) Name and describe one additional compone nt included in the “Sterman 
Model” that is lacking in the Malthusian human population growth model. 
Variable carrying capacity. In the Malthusian Model the carrying capacity is fixed, while 
in Sterman’s model technology, us e of resources, and waste generated all affect the 
carrying capacity. 
BONUS (3 points): List the three necessary (but not sufficient) principles of

     Exam Grading 
        
In grading of the exams we will be focusing on your level of understanding of the material 
associated with each problem. When we grade each pa rt of a problem we will do our best to assess, from 
your work, your level of understanding. On each part of an exam quest ion we will also indicate the 
percentage of the total exam grad e represented by that part, and your  numerical score on the exam will 
then be calculated accordingly.  
 Our assessment of your level of  understanding will be based upon what  is given in y our solution. A 
correct answer with no explanatio n will not receive full credit, a nd may not receive much-if any. An 
incorrect final answer having a solution and explan ation that shows excellent  understanding quite likely 
will receive full (or close to full) credit.

– How will the divergence angle of the beam change if λ is increased to mμ10 ? 
 
 
 
 5(e) (Grad ) (15 points) Suppose you need to design a two-mirror resonator for a high-power laser 
operating at mμ λ1= . You have at your disposal 3 pairs of mirrors: two spherical mirrors with ROC  
(radius of curvature) of 1 m, two spherical mirrors with ROC  = 2m , and two  plane mirrors 
( ). There are two requirements that must be satisfied: ∞ = ROC
(i) for a given power, the intensity at the mirrors must be as small as possible to avoid mirror 
damage; 
(ii) to achieve most effective amplifica tion, the gain medium with radius  is placed into 
the waist region  of the Gaussian beam. The waist size must not be too small, otherwise the 
beam will fill just a part of the gain medium, an d it also must not be too large, otherwise only a 
fraction of the beam will be amplified. Suppose that  the optimum waist radius is half the gain 
medium radius, . Thus the waist radius of the beam is fixed by the gain 
medium and cannot be vari ed in resonator design. mm r7 . 0=

 3Problem 1: Fabry-Perot Filter 
 (20 points) 
In most fiber optics transmission systems a single fiber is used for transmission of multiple channels, 
each of which has a different carrier frequency. Suppos e that you have a system with 40 channels; each 
channel has 40 GHz bandwidth and these channels ar e spaced by 100 GHz. A part of this spectrum is 
illustrated below. 
 
At the output of the fiber, each of these channels must be separated from the others before information carried by this channel can be used. Suppose we want to use a Fabry-Perot resonator as a filter to select the single channel at 194 THz. The two mirrors of the Fabry-Perot are identical and are separated by 
material with a refractive index of . 
5 . 1=n
(a) (5 points)  What is the requirement for the free spectral ra nge of the Fabry-Perot filter to be used for 
selecting 1 of these 40 channels? 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 4(b) (15 point)  Choose the length Lof the Fabry-Perot cavity and th e reflectivity of the mirrors, R, that 
can be used for extracting the channel at 194 THz .  We have the constraint that R cannot 
exceed 99% . If you think that the answer to this pr oblem is not unique, give a combination of L and 
R that will work.

 21Problem 9: Three-Level System 
(Graduate problem , 25 points) 
Consider an atom with three energy levels as shown in the figure. 
The pump at frequency hE Efp1 3−=  causes stimulated tran-
sitions between the 1st and the 3rd levels; the cross-section of this 
process is31σ. The 3rd level exhibits a spont aneous decay rate to 
the 2nd level of32γ. The second level is long-lived with a sponta-
neous decay rate of32 21γ γ< . With sufficient pumping, population 
inversion can be achieved between levels 2 and 1 so that the light 
at frequencyhE EfL1 2−=  will be amplified. The cross-section of 
stimulated transitions between levels 2 and 1 is 21σ.

enough to ignore the population of the 3rd level. Write the rate equations for the number of atoms in 
levels 1, 2, and 3, , , and . The pump intensity is . Assume that the intensity at 
frequency  is 1N2N3NpI

number of atoms is N.

2 2.	How did Nike finance its investing act ivities during the three-year period? 
Evaluate the appropriateness of Nike's  choice of financing during Year 3. (5 
points) 
3 II. Inventory accounting (10 points) 
The inventory footnote to the annual report of  Ballistic Brothers & Co. reads in part as 
follows: 
Because of continuing high demand throughout the year, inventories were 
unavoidably reduced and could not be re placed.  Under the LIFO system of 
accounting, used for many years by Ballistic Brothers & Co., the net effect of all 
the inventory changes was to increase pretax income by $900,000 over what it 
would have been had inventories been main tained at their physical levels at the 
start of the year. 
The price of Ballistic Brothers & Co.’s merchandise purchases was $26 per unit during 
the year, after having risen erratically over past years.  Ballistic Brothers & Co.’s 
inventory positions at the beginning and the end of the year appear below: 
Date Physical Count of Inventory LIFO Cost of Inventory 
January 1st 200,000 units ?
December 31st 150,000 units $600,000 
Answer the following questions: 
11. What was the average cost  per unit of the 50,000 units removed from the January 
st inventory? (5 points) 
2. What was the January 1st LIFO cost of inventory? (5 points) 
4 III. Accounting for bonds (25 points) 
On January 1, 1985, First National Bank (FNB) acquired $10 million of face 
value bonds issued on that date  by Metro Area Inc. The bo nds carried 12 percent annual 
coupons and were to mature 20 years from th e issue date. Metro Ar ea Inc. issued the 
bonds at par. 
By 1990, Metro Area Inc. was in severe financial difficulty and threatened to 
default on the bonds. After much negotiation with FNB (and other creditors), it  agreed to 
repay the bond issue but only on less burdensome terms. Metro Area Inc. agreed to pay 5 
percent per year, i.e., annually , for 25 years and to repay the principal on January 1, 2015, 
or 25 years after the negotia tion. FNB will receive $500,000 every year starting January 
1, 1991, and $10 million on January 1, 2015.  
By January 1, 1990, Metro Area Inc. wa s being charged 20 percent per year, 
compounded annually, for its new long-term borrowings. 
Remember that the theoretical present va lue factor of an ordinary annuity is: 
(PV annuity, n years, i%) = 1-(1+i)-n
 i 
and answer the following questions: 
1.	At what value is Metr o Area’s bond recorded on  FNB’s balance sheet before the 
renegotiations? ( Hint: FNB holds the bond as an investment and values the 
investment at present value.  The account ing treatment of th is investment in 
Metro Area’s bond mirrors the treatment of the bond in Metro Area’s balance 
sheet.) (5 points) 
2.	Determine the value of the bonds that FNB holds at the time of renegotiations 
using the market interest ra te at the time of initial issue, 12 percent, compounded 
annually. In other words, what is the present value of the newly promised cash payments discounted at Metro Ar ea’s historical borrowing rate? (5 points) 
5 3.	Consider two accounting treatments for th is negotiation (calle d a ""troubled debt 
restructuring"" by the FASB in its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 114). (10 points) 
Scenario a: Write down the bonds to the value computed in part 2, and base 
future interest revenue co mputations on that new book value and the historical 
interest rate of 12 percen t per year, compounded annually. 
Scenario b: Make no entry to record the negotiation, and r ecord interest 
revenue as the amount of cash, $500,000, that FNB receives annually.   
Record using the balance sheet equation  the transactions that take place on 
January 1, 1990 and January 1, 1991 under each of the two alternatives.

4.	Which of the two methods listed in 3 best reflects the economic events that take 
place during and after the debt restructuring?   Can you think of a third method to 
record the effect of  the renegotiations? (5 points) 
6 IV. Cost Accounting (15 points) 
The Tyson Company buys chickens and disa ssembles them into fillets, wings and 
drumsticks.  Suppose a whole chicken cost $1.6 each, and on average weighs 32 ounces. 
The cost to process each chicken into pa rts is $0.40 per chicken.  Once the parts are 
obtained, separate processing is necessary to obtain marketable fillets, wings, and 
drumsticks.  The fillets obtained from the chicken on average weigh 16 ounces, the wings 
weigh 4 ounces and the drumsticks weigh 12 ounces.  Each part must be cleaned, 
inspected and packaged. The costs of cl eaning and packaging fillets, wings and 
drumsticks are $0.8, $0.16 and $0.04 respectively per chicken.  Once cleaned and 
packaged, the fillets can be sold for $2.4, wings for $0.3 and drumsticks for $0.8.   
Answer the following questions: 
1.	What is the common cost per chicken shared by all three of Tyson’s product lines (i.e., fillet, wings and drumsticks)?  Allo cate the cost to the three products based 
on weights, and show the re lated profits (losses).  (5 points)

7 V. Leases (25 points) 
On January 1, 2001, Kruder Products, as lessee, leases a machine used in its operations. 
Kruder uses straight line deprec iation for all of its  equipments.  The annual lease payment 
of $10,000 is due on Dec 31 of 2001, 2002 and 2003.  The machine reverts to the lessor at the end of three years.  The lessor can either sell the machine or lease it to another firm 
for the remainder of its expected total useful  life of five years. The interest rate 
appropriate for Kruder Products is 12 percent annually.  The market value of the machine 
at the inception of the lease is $30,000. 
1.	Is this lease an operating lease or a capital lease? (5 points) 
2.	Assume  this lease qualifies as an operating lease.  What are the expenses recorded 
for the lease in 2001, 2002 and 2003? (5 points) 
3.	Assume this lease qualifies as a capital lease.   What are the expenses recorded for 
the lease in 2001? (5 points) 
4.	Which of the above methods, i.e., operat ing vs. capital lease results in a higher 
ROA (return on assets=income/average assets) in 2002 ?  Which method results in

8 VI. Miscellaneous issues (20 points) 
CBC Corporation is searching for ways to improve its performance. The head of 
marketing wants to offer larger sales discount s to repeat customers, while the head of 
operations wants reduce shippi ng and handling costs.  The company's controller thinks 
there could also be an ""accounting answer""-- his idea is to reduce the estimated life of 
packaging and delivery equipment in order to increase the amount of depreciation 
expense. He believes this would improve cash flow because depr eciation expense is 
""added back"" on the statement of cash flows.

VII. Consolidation (20 points) 
The Coca Cola Company [ KO] owns 44% of Coca Cola Enterprises [ CCE ], one of its anchor 
bottlers. Since its ownership percentage is lo wer than 50%, KO accounts for its investment in 
CCE using the equity method.  Analysts ha ve pointed out though that KO has a dominant 
influence on CCE and that to reflect the true economics of the relation between both companies, 
KO ought to consolidate  CCE, rather than use the equity method. 
a)	 Consider the simplified balance sh eets of both KO and CCE on 12/31/Y1 on the 
following page . Using the information about the ow nership percentage of KO in CCE, 
that is 44%, consolidate CCE’s accounts into KO’s.  Notice that we have already started 
the consolidation. You just need to complete  the consolidated balance sheet.  ( Hint: you 
need to first eliminate intra-company acc ounts, i.e., amounts CCE owns KO or vice 
versa before you can carry out the consolidation).

Answer the following questions: 
1.	Why did Nike experience increasing net in come but decreasing cash flow from 
operations during this three-year period? (5 points) 
NIKE’s growth in sales and net income led to increases of  account receivable 
and inventories. NIKE, however, did not increase its accounts payable and 
other current operating lia bilities to help finan ce the buildup in current 
assets. Thus, its cash flow from operations decreased. 
2 2.	How did Nike finance its investing act ivities during the three-year period? 
Evaluate the appropriateness of Nike's  choice of financing during Year 3. (5 
points) 
NIKE used cash flow from operations during Year 1 and Year 3 to finance its 
investing activities. The excess cash flow afte r investing activities served to repay 
short- and long-term debt and pay dividends. Cash flow form operations during Year 3 was insufficient to finance investing activities. NIKE engaged in short-term 
borrowing to make up the shortfall and finance the payment of dividends. 
Operating cash flows should generally fi nance the payment of dividends. Either 
operating cash flows or long-term sources of capital should  generally finance 
acquisitions of property, pl ant and equipment. Thus, NI KE’s use of short-term 
borrowing seems inappropriate. One might justify such an action if NIKE (1) 
expected cash flow from operations during Year  4 to return to its historical levels, 
(2) expected cash outflows for property, plant and equipment to decrease during 
Year 4, or (3) took advantage of compar atively low short-term borrowing rates 
during Year 3 and planned to refinance th is debt with long-term borrowing 
during Year 4. 
3 II. Inventory accounting (10 points) 
The inventory footnote to the annual report of  Ballistic Brothers & Co. reads in part as 
follows: 
Because of continuing high demand throughout the year, inventories were 
unavoidably reduced and could not be re placed.  Under the LIFO system of 
accounting, used for many years by Ballistic Brothers & Co., the net effect of all 
the inventory changes was to increase pretax income by $900,000 over what it 
would have been had inventories been main tained at their physical levels at the 
start of the year. 
The price of Ballistic Brothers & Co.’s merchandise purchases was $26 per unit during 
the year, after having risen erratically over past years.  Ballistic Brothers & Co.’s 
inventory positions at the beginning and the end of the year appear below: 
Date Physical Count of Inventory LIFO Cost of Inventory 
January 1st 200,000 units ?
December 31st 150,000 units $600,000 
Answer the following questions: 
11. What was the average cost  per unit of the 50,000 units removed from the January 
st inventory? (5 points) 
$8. Cost of goods sold was $900,000 lower than it would have been had the firm 
maintained inventories at 200,000 units. The average  cost of the 50,000 units 
removed from the beginning invento ry was $18 (= $900,000/50,000 units) less than 
current cost: $26 - $18 = $8 
2. What was the January 1st LIFO cost of inventory? (5 points) 
$1,000,000. Derived as follow: $8 X 50,000 units  = $400,000 decline in inventory 
during the year. Beginning inventory must have been $400,000 + $600,00 (ending 
inventory) = $1,000,000. 
4 III. Accounting for bonds (25 points) 
On January 1, 1985, First National Bank (FNB) acquired $10 million of face 
value bonds issued on that date  by Metro Area Inc. The bo nds carried 12 percent annual 
coupons and were to mature 20 years from th e issue date. Metro Ar ea Inc. issued the 
bonds at par. 
By 1990, Metro Area Inc. was in severe financial difficulty and threatened to 
default on the bonds. After much negotiation with FNB (and other creditors), it  agreed to 
repay the bond issue but only on less burdensome terms. Metro Area Inc. agreed to pay 5 
percent per year, i.e., annually , for 25 years and to repay the principal on January 1, 2015, 
or 25 years after the negotia tion. FNB will receive $500,000 every year starting January 
1, 1991, and $10 million on January 1, 2015.  
By January 1, 1990, Metro Area Inc. wa s being charged 20 percent per year, 
compounded annually, for its new long-term borrowings. 
Remember that the theoretical present va lue factor of an ordinary annuity is: 
(PV annuity, n years, i%) = 1-(1+i)-n
 i 
and answer the following questions: 
1.	At what value is Metr o Area’s bond recorded on  FNB’s balance sheet before the 
renegotiations? ( Hint: FNB holds the bond as an investment and values the 
investment at present value.  The account ing treatment of th is investment in 
Metro Area’s bond mirrors the treatment of the bond in Metro Area’s balance 
sheet.) (5 points) 
$10 million (issued at par) 
2.	Determine the value of the bonds that FNB holds at the time of renegotiations 
using the market interest ra te at the time of initial issue, 12 percent, compounded 
annually. In other words, what is the present value of the newly promised cash payments discounted at Metro Ar ea’s historical borrowing rate? (5 points) 
500,000 * (PV factor annuity, 12%, 25 years) = 500,000 * 7.843 = 3,921,570 10,000,000*(PV factor, 12%, 25 years) = 10,000,000 * 0.059 =  
588,233
 4,509,803 
3.	Consider two accounting treatments for th is negotiation (calle d a ""troubled debt 
restructuring"" by the FASB in its Statement of Financial Accounting Standards 
No. 114). (10 points) 
Scenario a: Write down the bonds to the value computed in part 2, and base 
future interest revenue co mputations on that new book value and the historical 
interest rate of 12 percen t per year, compounded annually. 
5 Scenario b: Make no entry to record the negotiation, and r ecord interest 
revenue as the amount of cash, $500,000, that FNB receives annually.   
Record using the balance sheet equation  the transactions that take place on 
January 1, 1990 and January 1, 1991 under each of the two alternatives.

4.	Which of the two methods listed in 3 best reflects the economic events that take 
place during and after the debt restructuring?   Can you think of a third method to 
record the effect of  the renegotiations? (5 points) 
Scenario a reflect part of the loss that FN B incurs during these renegotiations. Scenario 
b is not a good method since there is an inc onsistency between th e interest revenue 
received and the value recorded  for the bond on the balance sheet. 
A better alternative method to record the effect of the negotiations would be to use the 
current borrowing rate of Metro Area, i.e., 20% to do all the calculations. That is, we 
would use this 20 % to compute the present value of the bond at the time of renegotiations and then apply this 20% rate  to compute annual interest revenues. 
6 IV. Cost Accounting (15 points) 
The Tyson Company buys chickens and disa ssembles them into fillets, wings and 
drumsticks.  Suppose a whole chicken cost $1.6 each, and on average weighs 32 ounces. 
The cost to process each chicken into pa rts is $0.40 per chicken.  Once the parts are 
obtained, separate processing is necessary to obtain marketable fillets, wings, and 
drumsticks.  The fillets obtained from the chicken on average weigh 16 ounces, the wings 
weigh 4 ounces and the drumsticks weigh 12 ounces.  Each part must be cleaned, 
inspected and packaged. The costs of cl eaning and packaging fillets, wings and 
drumsticks are $0.8, $0.16 and $0.04 respectively per chicken.  Once cleaned and 
packaged, the fillets can be sold for $2.4, wings for $0.3 and drumsticks for $0.8.   
Answer the following questions: 
1.	What is the common cost per chicken shared by all three of Tyson’s product lines 
(i.e., fillet, wings and drumsticks)?  Allo cate the cost to the three products based 
on weights, and show the re lated profits (losses).  (5 points) 
Common Cost to be allo cated is $2 per chicken.

2.	The management is contemplating dr opping chicken wings and only producing 
fillets and drumsticks.  Do you agree? Why or why not? (10 points) 
They should not  drop the chicken wings.  This is because the joint cost $2 is 
incurred whether or not the wings are dropped from production.  If wings are 
dropped, the same $2 has to be allocated to the remaining two products: fillets 
and drumsticks. As we can see, now we are showing a loss fo r drumsticks.  Should 
we drop drumsticks, too? This is referred to as the ‘death spiral’ problem.  As we 
can see before, the total profit (from three product lines ) is $0.5.  Now it is only 
$0.36. We are worse off without the wings!

7 V. Leases (25 points) 
On January 1, 2001, Kruder Products, as lessee, leases a machine used in its operations. 
Kruder uses straight-line de preciation for all of its e quipments.  The annual lease 
payment of $10,000 is due on Dec 31 of 2001, 2002 and 2003.  The machine reverts to 
the lessor at the end of three years.  The lesso r can either sell the machine or lease it to 
another firm for the remainder of its expected to tal useful life of five  years.  The interest 
rate appropriate for Kruder Products is 12 percent annually.  The market value of the 
machine at the inception of the lease is $30,000. 
1.	Is this lease an operating lease or a capital lease? (5 points) 
This lease does not satisfy any  of the criteria for a capital lease, so it is an 
operating lease.  The leases asset reverts to the lessor at the end of the lease 
period. The life of the lease is less than 75% of the expected us eful life of the 
asset. The present value of the lease payments is 24,018 (=10,000*2.40183), 
which is less than 90% of th e market value of the asset. 
2.	Assume  this lease qualifies as an operating lease.  What are the expenses recorded 
for the lease in 2001, 2002 and 2003? (5 points) 
If this is an operating lease, then  the rent expense is $10,000 per year 
3.	Assume this lease qualifies as a capital lease.   What are the expenses recorded for 
the lease in 2001? (5 points) 
The expenses include a depreciation expense and an interest expense.   
Depreciation expense = 24,018/3 = $8006 
Interest expense = 24,018*12% = $2882 
4.	Which of the above methods, i.e., operat ing vs. capital lease results in a higher 
ROA (return on assets=income/average assets) in 2002 ?  Which method results in 
a higher leverage (liability/ shareholder’s equity) in 2002? Why? (5 points) 
The total expense is $10,000 under operating le ase.  Under capital lease, we need 
to calculate the new depreciation and interest expense for 2002.  Depreciation 
stays the same at $8006. Interest expense = 16900*12%= $2028. Therefore total 
expense is higher under capital lease. Furthermore, capital lease is going to 
result in higher assets in 2001 and 2002.  Therefore, ROA is higher under 
operating lease. Because capital lease results in higher liability and lower 
shareholder’s equity, leverage is higher under capital lease. 
5.	Which of the above methods, i.e., operat ing vs. capital lease results in a higher 
Cash Flow from Operations in 2001 ? Why? (5 points) 
Capital will result in a higher cash flow from operating activities.  This is because 
CFO=net income +/- adjustments.  Capital lease results in lower income, but the 
depreciation part needs to be added back so  the net effect is only –$2882 vs -
$10,000 for operating lease. Intuitively, th e cash outflow under capital lease is 
split into two parts: the inte rest expense part goes into CF from operating , and 
the part that reduces th e principal goes into cash flow from financing  activities.

1. Determine the accumulated depreciation on the equipment sold in 2002? (5 points) 
Selling price - (cost - accumulated depreciation) = gain on sale 
$18,000 - ($35,000 -  x) = $10,000;  x = $27,000 
2.	CBC deferred $5000 of their revenue to 2003 becau se the merchandise has not yet been 
shipped although the customers already paid in cash.  Does deferring the revenue result in 
a deferred tax asset or liability?  Why? (5 points) 
This will result in Deferred Tax Asset.  This is because the deferred revenue is 
going to cause GAAP income<IRS income, and therefore tax expense is less than 
tax payable.

bottlers. Since its ownership percentage is lo wer than 50%, KO accounts for its investment in 
CCE using the equity method.  Analysts ha ve pointed out though that KO has a dominant 
influence on CCE and that to reflect the true economics of the relation between both companies, 
KO ought to consolidate  CCE, rather than use the equity method. 
a)	 Consider the simplified balance sh eets of both KO and CCE on 12/31/Y1 on the 
following page . Using the information about the ow nership percentage of KO in CCE, 
that is 44%, consolidate CCE’s accounts into KO’s.  Notice that we have already started 
the consolidation. You just need to complete  the consolidated balance sheet.  ( Hint: you 
need to first eliminate intra-company acc ounts, i.e., amounts CCE owns KO or vice 
versa before you can carry out the consolidation). 
Show all calculations. (10 points) 
-We eliminate intra-com pany transactions from both the amounts due and the 
accounts payable (6). 
-We eliminate the investment in CCE (556). 
-We realize that book value of equity of KO is the same whether we follow the equity 
method or fully consolidate. 
-We record minority interest: 56% of the book value of CCE 
-We record the plug: in this case a negative goodwill of 62

b) Consider now the following intra-compa ny sales during the same fiscal year: 
KO paid CCE $2,424 (i.e., booked as revenue for CCE and COGS for KO) 
12 We also have the following excerpts from the published income statements of both 
companies in fiscal Y1: 
KO CCE 
Sales 18,018 6,773 
COGS 6,940 4,267 
Gross Profit 11,078 2,506 
The gross profit for KO is computed with CCE treated as an equity investment.  Based on 
our information, what would have been KO’s gross profit if it had consolidated CCE 
rather than used the equity method? (5 points ) 
We would eliminate $2,424 from both the revenues of CCE and the COGS of KO.  Net this means that the two adjustments cancel out, so Gross Profit stays exactly the same. 
c)	 CCE reports a net income of $82 in its publis hed income statement of fiscal Y1.  KO 
reports a net income of $2,986 in its published income statement of fiscal Y1, after 
incorporating the results of  CCE using the equity method.  What would be the net 
income of KO in Y1 if it had consolidated CCE rather than used the equity 
method ?  Explain why. (5 points) 
Net income is the same under both methods. Equity method reflects our stake in 
one line. Full consolidation spreads ou r stake out over al l the revenue and 
expense items on the income statement and  adjusts for the minority interest: net 
effect on income is therefore the same under either method.
