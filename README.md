# Question Generation from Educational Texts

This is a project I worked on in spring 2023 with 3 teammates. We scraped large amounts of open educational text and processed it to separate the lectures. Each lecture has a corresponding list of questions. I scraped CK12 and OpenTextBC, and processed OpenTextBC to remove the noise and issues from it using regular expressions.

I also trained a LoRA of a Bloom model to make the model generate new questions.
